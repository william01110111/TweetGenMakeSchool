Oh, smell that air. Grass and lemonade. And a little bit of mint. A hint of mint. Must be the nineteen twenties.
Oh, yeah.
The trouble is, we haven't been invited. Oh, I forgot. Yes, we have.
We'll be late for cocktails.
Flapper. You look lovely.
Good afternoon.
And a lime and soda, thank you.
Lady Eddison.
I'm the Doctor. And this is Miss Donna Noble, of the Chiswick Nobles.
No, no, no, no, no. No, don't do that. Don't.
We were thrilled to receive your invitation, my lady. We met at the Ambassador's reception.
A unicorn? Brilliant. Where?
Hello. I'm the Doctor.
Very well.
The Eddison title descends through her. One day Roger will be a lord.
Or Time Lords.
Agatha Christie. I was just talking about you the other day. I said, I bet she's brilliant. I'm the Doctor. This is Donna. Oh, I love your stuff. What a mind. You fool me every time. Well, almost every time. Well, once or twice. Well, once. But it was a good once.
Oh, no, no, no, no. We're not married.
Oh. Oh, you don't miss a trick.
Excuse me, Colonel.
The date on this newspaper.
It's the day Agatha Christie disappeared.
She'd just discovered her husband was having an affair.
Well, she's British and moneyed. That's what they do. They carry on. Except for this one time. No one knows exactly what happened. She just vanished. Her car will be found tomorrow morning by the side of a lake. Ten days later, Agatha Christie turns up in a hotel in Harrogate. Said she'd lost her memory. She never spoke about the disappearance till the day she died, but whatever it was.
Right here, right now.
Bashed on the head. Blunt instrument. Watch broke as he fell. Time of death was quarter past four.
Nothing worth killing for in that lot. Dry as dust.
You don't have to. Chief Inspector Smith from Scotland Yard, known as the Doctor. Miss Noble is the plucky young girl who helps me out.
Mrs Christie was right. Go into the sitting room. I will question each of you in turn.
No policewomen in 1926.
Well the last thing we want is PC Plod sticking his nose in, especially now I've found this. Morphic residue.
It's left behind when certain species genetically re-encode.
Which means one of that lot is an alien in human form.
So? Happens to me all the time.
Well.
There's no Noddy.
But not yet.
Anyway. Agatha and I will question the suspects. Donna, you search the bedrooms. Look for clues. (sotto) Any more residue.
You'll need this.
Go on. You're ever so plucky.
Right then. Solving a murder mystery with Agatha Christie. Brilliant.
Sorry. Yeah.
Yeah.
Now then, Reverend. Where were you at a quarter past four?
No alibi, then.
And where were you?
Alone?
And where were you?
We've only got your word for it.
And where were you, sir?
Colonel, snap out of it.
No, no, no. Right out of it.
And where were you at a quarter past four, my lady?
Yes, yes. You can stop now. I was there for that bit.
Oh, yes, little grey cells. Good old Poirot. You know, I've been to Belgium. Yeah. I remember I was deep in the Ardennes, trying to find Charlemagne. He'd been kidnapped by an insane computer.
Sorry.
I've got a very good memory.
What, that bit of paper you nicked out the fire?
Yeah, but I saw you reflected in the glass of the bookcase.
What's that first letter?
Maiden! What does that mean?
What do you mean, a giant wasp?
Let me see.
It's gone. Buzzed off.
Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Let me
Giant wasp. Well, tons of amorphous insectivorous lifeforms, but none in this galactic vector.
Oh, a creature this size? Got to be able to grow a new one.
Exactly. So. The question is, what's it doing here?
There!
Come on!
Oh, but you are wonderful. Now, just stop. Stop there.
Don't let it get away! Quick, before it reverts back to human form. Where are you? Come on. There's nowhere to run. Show yourself!
Oh, that's just cheating.
She said, the poor little child. Does that mean anything to anyone?
Ooo. Someone came here tooled up. The sort of stuff a thief would use.
The Unicorn and the wasp.
Very good, Greeves.
Vespiform sting. Vespiforms have got hives in the Silfrax galaxy.
But for some reason, this one's behaving like a character in one of your books.
Donna.
No. Something's inhibiting my enzymes. Argh! I've been poisoned.
Ginger beer!
I need ginger beer.
Not for me. I can stimulate the inhibited enzymes into reversal. Protein. I need protein.
Brilliant.
Harvey Wallbanger?
How is Harvey Wallbanger one word?
Salt. I was miming salt. It's salt. I need something salty.
What is it?
No, too salty.
Camptown Races?
It's a shock. Look, shock. I need a shock.
Detox. Oh my. I must do that more often. I mean, the detox.
A terrible day for all of us. The Professor struck down, Miss Chandrakala taken cruelly from us, and yet we still take dinner.
And then someone tried to poison me. Any one of you had the chance to put cyanide in my drink. But it rather gave me an idea.
Well, poison. Drink up. I've laced the soup with pepper.
But the active ingredient of pepper is piperine, traditionally used as an insecticide. So, anyone got the shivers?
Listen, listen, listen, listen.
Nobody move. No, don't! Stay where you are.
Out, out, out, out, out, out!
Not you, Agatha. You've got a long, long life to live yet.
Then who did?
This thing can sting, it can fly. It could wipe us all out in seconds. Why is it playing this game?
What does a Vespiform want?
You're right. Ah, I've been so caught up with giant wasps that I've forgotten. You're the expert.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because plenty of people write detective stories, but yours are the best. And why? Why are you so good, Agatha Christie? Because you understand. You've lived, you've fought, you've had your heart broken. You know about people. Their passions, their hope, and despair, and anger. All of those tiny, huge things that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer. Just think, Agatha. If anyone can solve this, it's you.
I've called you here on this
And it was no ordinary pregnancy.
Excuse me Agatha, this is my territory. But when you heard that buzzing sound in the dining room, you said, it can't be. Why did you say that?
Thank you. At this point, when we consider the lies and the secrets, and the key to these events, then we have to consider it was you, Donna Noble.
No, but you said it all along. The vital clue. This whole thing is being acted out like a murder mystery, which means it was you, Agatha Christie.
No. But she wrote. She wrote those brilliant, clever books. And who's her greatest admirer?
No. But just think. Last Thursday night, what were you doing?
Just think. What else happened on Thursday night?
You said on the lawn, this afternoon. Last Thursday night, those boys broke into your church.
Really? A man of God against two strong lads? A man in his forties? Or, should I say forty years old, exactly?
Lady Eddison, your child, how old would he be now?
Your child has come home.
Oh? You said you were taught by the Christian Fathers, meaning you were raised in an orphanage.
You found those thieves, Reverend, and you got angry. A proper, deep anger, for the first time in your life, and it broke the genetic lock. You changed.
You realised your inheritance. After all these years, you knew who you were. Oh, and then it all kicks off, because this isn't just a jewel. It's a Vespiform telepathic recorder. It's part of you, your brain, your very essence. And when you activated, so did the Firestone. It beamed your full identity directly into your mind. And, at the same time, it absorbed the works of Agatha Christie directly from Lady Eddison. It all became part of you. The mechanics of those novels formed a template in your brain. You've killed, in this pattern, because that's what you think the world is. It turns out, we are in the middle of a murder mystery. One of yours, Dame Agatha.
Oh. Sorry, not yet.
Yes.
Lady who?
Little bit of buzzing there, Vicar.
Why? What happens then?
Agatha, what are you doing?
Come on.
Time is in flux, Donna. For all we know, this is the night Agatha Christie loses her life and history gets changed.
The lake. She's heading for the lake. What's she doing?
Its mind is based on her thought processes. They're linked.
Don't hurt her. You're not meant to be like this. You've got the wrong template in your mind.
Donna, that thing couldn't help itself.

Oh, it's the Firestone. It's part of the Vespiform's mind. It's dying and it's connected to Agatha.
He let her go. Right at the end, the Vespiform chose to save someone's life.
Of course. The amnesia. Wiped her mind of everything that happened. The wasp, the murders.
Yeah, but we've solved another riddle. The mystery of Agatha Christie. And tomorrow morning, her car gets found by the side of a lake. A few days later, she turns up in hotel at Harrogate with no idea of what just happened.
No one'll ever know.
Shameful story. They'd never talk of it. Too British. While the Unicorn does a bunk back to London town. She can never even say she was there.
Oh, great life. Met another man, married again. Saw the world. Wrote and wrote and wrote.
The thing is, I don't think she ever quite forgot. Great mind like that, some of the details kept bleeding through. All the stuff her imagination could use. Like, Miss Marple.
And, where is it, where is it, hold on. Here we go.
C. That is C for Cybermen, C for Carrionites, (the green ball, a head of Caesar), and Christie, Agatha. Look at that.
Somewhere in the back of her mind, it all lingered. And that's not all. Look at the copyright page.
People never stop reading them. She is the best selling novelist of all time.
Well, no one knows how they're going to be remembered. All we can do is hope for the best. Maybe that's what kept her writing. Same thing keeps me travelling. Onwards?

It's that way.
Are those trees?
Yes. Do you have an appointment? You need an appointment to see the Doctor.
When you drink a glass of Coke, it's only this big, but it's actually got this much sugar in it. It works a bit like that.
The Tardis. It's bigger on the inside than the outside, or did you not notice?
Well, of course it's supposed to be bigger. Most people are confused by that.
Miss Oswald? Dark hair? Highly unpredictable? Surprisingly round face?
The PE teacher.
Mister Pink was looking after you? Well, that explains why you're lost.

That's not quite true. I, for instance, have no idea why, when the terrestrial navigation
The terrestrial navigation starts up, it closes down all the other systems.
Hmm. That's another of the drawbacks of being the last of your species. No one to ask when your Tardis won't start.
No, we haven't. We're supposed to be in the middle of London.
Oh, stop saying that!
We are in the middle of a forest.
Do I. Sorry, what?
Yes, well, there are some things I've never seen, but that's usually because I've chosen not to see them. Even my incredibly long life is too short for Les Miserables.
Well, when you come to collect this child, you can tell me then.
Young female human. Standard defenceless little girl. Your friend Mister Pink was supposed to be looking after her.
Good point. You. Have you got a name at all?
Trafalgar
Square.I found her wandering around the
Brand new forest.
Yes. It's like the
New Forest, except even newer.
Was that the amazing thing you were going to show me?'
It is amazing, but I saw it first.
No, I can't
Bring her over. I'm a Time Lord, not a childminder.
And
I've got a global rapid afforestation crisis to deal with.
Why would there be no reading? Because they are actually made of wood. No circuits. No mechanism. Wood.
This is a sonic screwdriver. It interacts with any form of communication you care to mention. Sadly, trees have no moving parts and don't communicate.
What?
So, what, do you think that's how spring begins? With a group message on Tree Facebook? Do you think they send texts to each other?
The rings mark the years of growth. One ring for each year. This grew up overnight. That whole tree is the result of just one night's growth, and they're still growing.
Well, having looked at things, I think, probably, the answer to that is no.
Oh, yes, I am. Very clever. But what use is clever against trees? They don't listen to reason. You can't plead with them. You can't lie to them. They have no moving parts, no circuits. This is a natural event.
Exactly what they said about the Ice Age. How can whole glaciers just pop up out of nowhere? Well, they just did. That's how this planet grows - a series of catastrophes. Farewell to the Ice Age. Welcome to the Tree Age. Possibly. When the Ice Age was here, you lot managed to cook mammoth. Now there's a forest, you'll just have to eat nuts.
Time. Interesting.
A tree is a time machine. You plant a little acorn in 1795, and in the year 2016, there's an oak tree, there, in the same spot, with a tiny little bit of 1795 still alive inside of it. You can't create an overnight forest with extra special fertiliser. You have to mess with the fabric of time. And communicate with trees.
By trees?
Ask your teacher. Come on! Down from there! Hey! Away from the console. Come on. That's an antique. Get away from there! Don't touch that!
Haven't any of you been struck by the fact that it's, look, it's bigger on the inside?
These trees all appeared at once. That wasn't a coincidence. There's no such thing as an arboreal coincidence. Something, someone has coordinated this. To coordinate, you need to communicate. Every communication channel on the Tardis is open, and nothing.
Except. Let me see that.
Maebh Arden. Maebh Arden. Which one is Maebh Arden? Which one's Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh? Maebh?
Argh!
We've got to find her!
What do the voices say?
You people. You never learn. If a child is speaking, listen to it.
He's right. She was trying to tell me something and I ignored her. Maebh Arden is tuned to a different channel. She can lead us to the source, to the heart of the forest. We have to listen to her. We have to find her.
Does she have a phone?
Have you got the number?
Maebh Arden. Five hundred yards south east of here. I'll go get her.
Hey! Do not. Touch. Anything. Anything. H-h-okay?
Gifted and talented? Really?
They're in the Tardis, the safest place on the planet.
If this is an invasion
It's over. They're here, they've won. What do they want?
Clara!
Doesn't want to be followed? Lost a hold of it in a struggle? Left it as a clue, so we would know where she was going? Trail of breadcrumbs. Hansel and Gretel.
You just lost a little girl.
You're pursuing a little lost girl through a mysterious forest. The path has disappeared. You find yourself with a strangely compelling masculine figure. Maebh!
Exactly. The forest. It's in all the stories that kept you awake at night. The forest is mankind's nightmare.
Clara. Is it hers?
Trees control the oxygen on this planet. They withhold it, they smother the fire. What sort of forest is clever? What sort of forest has its own in-built fire extinguisher?
Why now?
The whole natural order is turning against this planet. But why? Why now?
How did she know this?
This is a massive solar flare headed for Earth, like the one that destroyed the Bank of Karabraxos. I've got an entire Tardis and I didn't notice this. But she knew. How?
You left your marking in the Tardis.
I've just informed you that a solar flare is going to wipe out your planet. You're worried about a row with your boyfriend. How did she know this? She even put the date on it!
It's today's date.
They want something. They're saying something. If there is a way, the way is Maebh Arden.
She's lost someone. People who've lost someone, they're always listening, always looking, always hoping. So, they notice more. They hear more.
Would that be the London with the zoo? The zoo with the pack of wolves? The zoo whose barriers and gates have probably been mangled by the trees? No, wolves are not impossible. Stick to the path, Red Riding Hood.
Then we're lunch.
Maebh. You came looking for me. You didn't
Maebh, Maebh, you didn't just stumble into the Tardis. Tell me what you know.
This is important.
These are zoo wolves. They're not even used to hunting.
All right, okay. We've just got to look as if we're too much bother to eat, right? So, stay still. Stay together. Look big. Look big like a big three-headed, six-legged scary thing!
Ha ha! Told you they were rubbish. Those wolves are terrified.
There are very good solid scientific reasons for being really quite frightened just now.
No, no. Not her medication. We don't want to shut her up. We want to know what she knows. Maebh, what's the. Maebh, what is this? What is this?
This is not a nervous tic. This is react
Maebh. Maebh, this forest is communicating. With you. Nobody else. No technology can hear what it's saying, but you can. Tell us what it wants. Where it came from. Just tell me who did this.
No, Maebh. You didn't make a global forest appear overnight. How could you do that?
Everything's subject to gravity. If I can create a little local increase
Who are they?
Here? That's it?
Why now? Why are you here now?
Who is calling you now?
You sent for me. The girl came looking for me. Why? Why me?
Maebh, you came looking for the Doctor. Think. Who sent you for the Doctor?
Stars implode. Planets grow cold. Catastrophe is the metabolism of the universe. I can fight monsters. I can't fight physics.
You've been chopping them down for furniture for centuries. If that's love, no wonder they're calling down fire from the heavens.
They're about to be erased.
We're all going. We're taking the kids.
I can save you and Danny.
I can save you.
What, you don't want to live?
What?
Say what?
Then why did you bring us all here?
This is my world, too. I walk your earth, I breathe your air.
Maebh! I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.
Flame-proof forest. Flame-proof forest. A thousand atom bombs and no one hurt. I am Doctor Idiot!
Clara! Come back here! Come back!
Clara! Mister Pink! Maebh! All of you! Quick, quick! Come back. Come back. Come on.
Maebh, quick. Good girl, good girl. Come on.
It's there on the screen, look. Big solar flare headed this way. A thousand kilometres a second. Coronal mass ejection. Geomagnetic storm. It's huge. It's brewing up a solar wind
I assumed your teachers have mentioned this?
Okay. Okay. Well, this is the bad news. The good news is, it's happened before. And you're still here. The Tunguska Blast, 1908. That should have blown the whole planet off its axis, but it didn't. It knocked a few trees over. Well, a few tens of thousands of trees over. Curu in Brazil. Same story.Earth should have been smashed, but it wasn't. What do these things have in common?
Trees. Whenever there's a planet-threatening, extra-terrestrial impact, trees. Massive forest, filling the atmosphere with oxygen. Pumping it up like a massive, highly inflammable airbag, so that when trouble hits
No. The impact burns off the excess oxygen. You have some fairly hectic weather for a few days and some fairly trippy looking sunsets, but apart from that, you will be all right. I was wrong. The trees are not your enemy. They're your shield. They've been saving you since for ever. Protecting you from everything that space can throw at you.
Atmospheric dust, captured by the trees. The fingerprint of an asteroid. Happy Red Ring Day.
What is it with you people? You hear voices, you want to shut them up. The trees come to save you, you want to chop them down.
I did admit that I was wrong. Excellent. Mobile networks are still operative. Right. We are going to call everyone on Earth and tell them to leave the trees alone.
Okay. Okay. Class project. Save the Earth.
Okay, who would like to witness a once in a billion years solar event at close quarters?
I hope I'm right. It would be slightly awkward if the world was destroyed at this point.
There goes the planet-sized airbag. That's the trees, harvesting the solar fire.
You'll all forget it ever happened.
You forgot the last time. You remembered the fear and you put it into fairy stories. It's a human superpower, forgetting. If you remembered how things felt, you'd have stopped having wars. And stopped having babies.

Of course we've made it. Did you think we wouldn't?
There's really nothing that can go wrong with a Time Ring, except a molecular short circuit.
Yes?
Well, it probably hasn't arrived yet. We're a little early.
No. You see, the Tardis is drifting back through time, Harry. We just have to wait for it to turn up.
What, that?
No.
Well, you take good care of it, Harry.
How long?
Sterile atmosphere.
He wouldn't have been left there for two weeks unless
Unless there was something seriously wrong here. Come on.
The control's locked.
Those poor fellows couldn't. They were trapped in the after end and left to die. Whatever did it might be on the other side of this door. There might be a way of opening it.
Well of course it doesn't. This is a different point in time.
Some of that equipment. This is probably a beacon, put in orbit to service and guide space freighters.
Thousands of years before, Harry.
All you have to remember is that this is where we parted company with the Tardis.
If they've changed things round, the Tardis might materialise in the forward control rooms.
Yes, I think so. If you two could put your weight on the door and stop it opening too suddenly. Don't want to lose my arm. I'm rather attached to it. It's so handy.
Yes.
Thank you.
No, this is the forward control room.
No, but the Time Ring is designed with a slight safety margin. We can expect it to arrive soon.
I'm the Doctor. This is Sarah Jane Smith, Harry Sullivan. We're travellers.
What are you going to do?
The man's sick. He needs treatment.
Sorry, gentlemen, I can't allow it.
My colleague is a doctor of medicine and I'm a doctor of many things. If we could examine
Who's the homicidal maniac?
Yes, we're from Earth. We want to help you.
I don't believe you've got the plague here, Commander.
Did they identify it?
Well, now you've got a new medical team. Well, Commander?
Thank you.
Have you noticed these rather strange scratches, Commander?
They're all over the ship. I've seen them somewhere before, if I could only remember where.
Everything's important. Well, well, well.
I've just made a third interesting discovery about your plague virus, Commander.
Yes. One, it scratches metal. Two, it attacks its victims so suddenly that they become unconscious before they can even raise the alarm, and three.
It removes tape from radio logs. It must be a very literate and inquisitive virus.
Whatever it is that's attacking your crew, Commander, it's certainly not a plague.
Who's your civilian?
Interesting. Planetary survey. Of what?
I thought Jupiter had already been thoroughly studied.
What, do you mean there are now thirteen?
What's it called?
Voga. Of course. Has he been down there?
Voga. Voga. Planet of gold. Yes, it's all coming back to me now.
Cybermen. That's what we're up against, Commander. Cybermen.
They disappeared after their attack on Voga at the end of the Cyber War. Not the same thing as dying out, Commander. They're utterly ruthless. Total machine creatures.
How is he?
Yes, just as I thought.
Yes, like a snake bite.
He's been injected with poison.
If only I'd been quicker, I might have saved him.
The matter beam disperses human molecules. That type of alien poison might be separated and rejected.
I smell a rat.
Gold.
Sarah!
Don't let it bite you!
That cybermat's happened, Harry. Quick, into the transmat beam, quickly as you can. It's the only way to get the poison out of her system.
No, sir. That's your so-called plague, Commander.
Not any more, but there are bound to be others around.
Hang on to her, Harry. You'd better travel with her.
I'll set the beam for Voga. Do you know how to work the reciprocator?
Off you go. No time to lose.
Sabotage.
Someone's taken the pentalium drive.
Who removed the tape from your radio log? Who used cybermats to murder your crew? And who's desperate to break all communication between this beacon and Voga?
Exactly. Kellman. Your friendly exographer must be working for the Cybermen, Commander.
Right, this might just work if I can adapt the monoso to a three phase output.
I know, Harry, I know!
There isn't time to wire this in. I'll have to hold it in position. Ready?
Voga, otherwise known as the Planet of Gold, is hated and feared by Cybermen because gold is lethal to them.
It's the perfect non-corrodible metal. It plates their breathing apparatus and in effect suffocates them. Doesn't it, Professor. Now Sarah and Harry are down there, and without that pentalium drive I can't bring them back.
Yes. Keeps in touch with his masters. What have you done with the pentalium drive, Professor?
I think he's lying.
This? Oh, nothing. Why, is it important?
Yes, I think our friend is lying to gain time.
But time for what, I wonder?
Leave it. Don't shoot, Commander.
After you've been bitten, Kellman, you'll have just ten seconds to remember where that pentalium drive is, if you want to live.
Splendid.
Good. Now we can get Harry and Sarah back.
Right. Now let's see if it works.
Strange.
Yes, full power. They must have left the receptor circle.
We've got to stop them getting in.
Cybermen!
No good.
What's your cut, Kellman? Voga's gold?
Oh, really.
Isn't it wonderful to feel needed, Commander?
What great rewards have you promised Kellman?
Everything's of interest to me, and Cybermen possess nothing that a human might want.
Then what is it? You've no home planet, no influence, nothing. You're just a pathetic bunch of tin soldiers skulking about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship.
No, I don't think so, somehow. You tried that once and you were nearly wiped out.
It was a glorious triumph, for human ingenuity. They discovered your weakness and invented the glitter gun, and that was the end of Cybermen except as gold-plated souvenirs that people use as hat stands.
Oh, there's to be a second campaign, is there?
Loose thinking. The trouble with Cybermen is they've got hydraulic muscles, and of course hydraulic brains to go with them.
Thank you. Now, if I'm correct about what this contains, and should accidentally drop it.
Now, I want some information from you, Cyber Leader.
What's Kellman expecting to get out of all this?
Your puppet dictator
In exchange. I wouldn't have thought his ambitions lay in that direction.
Yes, and their use was banned by the Armageddon Convention.
Fragmatise? Oh well, I suppose we can't expect decent English from a machine.
And when we reach the centre of Voga, we'll be fragmatised, as you put it.
Anything else before we go?
Thank you.
Careful, careful. I might explode.
Someone's trying to attract your attention. Come on, let's get out of here!
If only they knew about the use of gold.
Yes. It's the only thing that's effective against Cybermen.
Not a word of it. Once we've reached the explosive zone we'll have outlived our usefulness.
Keep moving. Give their radar scope something to follow.
I think my idea's better.
I don't know yet. That's the trouble with ideas. They only come a bit at a time.
Steady.
We'll rest for a moment.
The deeper we go, the heavier the concentration of gold. Before long, it must start affecting their radar picture.
Well, it's an outside chance, but if we can get back without being detected, and take the Cybermen from behind. All right now, Commander?
Let's go.
Sit down a moment. Actually, I think we're very near the centre now. This is pretty well solid gold.
Look out! Get back!
Harry, were you trying to undo this?
Did you make the rocks fall, Harry?
Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!
So where is Sarah?
What?
Harry, I'm not with you.
Yes.
Listen, listen, listen! Commander, if you were to keep on going towards the centre, you could draw the radar track away from the rest of us.
Meantime, Lester and I could take the cross shaft and attack the Cybermen from the rear.
Gold. Plain, old-fashioned gold.
Good luck, Commander.
Come on.
How much have we got?
I know we've got five minutes. I mean how much gold dust have we got?
That might be enough. You know what to do?
You've got it, Harry. Come on.
There they are. Wait till I give the signal.
Ready?
Now.
Come on, Harry. Run for it.
Come on.
It's still working.
Well, I'm impressed.
Oh, please, don't call me human. Just Doctor will do very nicely, thank you. Is that your rocket?
Er, before you do anything rash, like pressing another button, may I make an alternative suggestion?
Let me take the transmat back to the Beacon and deal with the Cybermen myself.
Give me just fifteen minutes. If at the end of that time I haven't come through on the radio, well then you can fire off your rocket.
I've a young friend on the Beacon. Sarah Jane, the girl who was here. She risked her life to save mine. The least I can do is accept the same risk for her.
Just fifteen minutes. Is that so intolerable?
Thank you, Tyram. There's just one other thing I need.
A bag of gold dust.
Thank you. Harry.
While I'm gone, you'd better find the Commander.
(hiding) Shush.
You haven't seen anything of the Tardis, have you?
Are they? And we've got about nine minutes before the Vogans aim their rocket at us. Get the control box. We'll see what we can do.
Yes?
Is it?
Oh. Right. Come on, quickly then.
Just you wait and see.
They've started the engines.
Come on, let's hide.
Looks like it.
Dusty death. Out, out with
What?
All right, all right, all right. You've made your point. We surrender. We surrender.
Bye bye.
Nice sense of irony. I thought for a moment he was going to smile.
Judging by the speed at which the rocket is approaching, two or three minutes.
Yes, that's right.
Hmm? I used to untangle Turk's Head eye-splice with the grommets I picked up from Houdini. It should work.
Good girl. That rocket's getting too close for comfort.
Hello, Voga. Hello, Voga. This is Nerva Beacon.
Commander, tell Vorus the Cybermen have abandoned the beacon. He's to aim the rocket at the cybership.
What? Just let me think.
Commander?
There are two levers on the left of the panel. Got them?
The top lever controls the angle of flight, and the lower one must be the direction and stabiliser control.
Cogito ergo sum.
I think, therefore it missed.
Oh, yes. Oh no. They've locked the gyro controls. The flight trimmers are jammed.
It means we're heading for the biggest bang in history.
That should do it.
Hang on. If I pull her back at this speed, she'll break in half.
Yes, I think she'll settle down nicely into orbit now.
I think I'll just set the drift compensators. We don't want it slipping through our fingers.
Don't just stand there. Come on.
I'm needed back on Earth.
I left the Brigadier a space-time telegraph system and told him not to use it unless he had a real emergency on his hands.
He has. Come on, you two.
Come on!

There we are, safely down.
Hmm?
What movement?
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
So you're awake at last, young man.
My dear boy, there's a great deal of difference between resting and being sort of, bone idle!
No, thank you, I've had my breakfast.
The answer, dear boy, is pipes.
Pipes, Chesterton, pipes!
You see, the Romans, unfortunately, didn't know how to transport water satisfactorily. That's why they built their aqueducts. Now, if they'd experimented with pipes.
Good, good, yes, yes, they have.
Oh, my dear young man, why do you let your mind wander so? You asked me just now if Barbara and Vicki had gone down to the village. I gave you a plain and simple answer. Yes, they have.
Wonderful feast, my dear. I don't know when I've enjoyed a meal more. What was it?
Oh, exquisite.
Oh, fabulous, my dear, absolutely fabulous. What was it we had before, the sort of hors d'oeuvres, so to speak?
Tut, tut, tut, tut child. Barbara, what was it? Hmm?
Oh, absolutely. What did you say?
Yes, that's what I thought she said. Ant's eggs. What do you think I am, a goldfish, hmm?
Well, go ahead my boy.
Well, what about it, hmm?
Oh, so you want to move on, do you?
Good, that's settled. Settled. Fine.
How many times do I have to tell you that the Tardis is quite safe where it is. It can take off from any angle. I've never known such a pair of worriers. Really. Good heavens, I can't wait to get away for a couple of days from you. You keep on and on and on and on and on. Gracious me, really.
Well, I think these should last me two or three days, hmm?
Oh? Well, I don't know that I was under any obligation to report my movements to you, Chesterfield.
Oh, Barbara's calling you.
To Rome, my child.
Well, I.
Hmm. Very well, then, very well,
But my dear chap, you just turned down my invitation.
Yes, you said how glad you would be to stay here as long as possible.
What is this, what is this now? I know what you're insinuating. Yes, that I'm not capable of taking care of myself, ay? Huh! Safer indeed. Afraid to let me out of your sight, are you? Want to be my nursemaids? Well now, let me tell me something. I won't stand for it. Indeed, I will not stand for it. You want to go to Rome? Go. Go yourselves.
Yes, of course, my dear, come along. Let's set about our packing, shall we? Come on, then. Yes, you know, this is going to be your first exploration. You know, I think you'll like Rome. Rome is fascinating, most interesting. I remember once when I was there and I spoke to
Well, what have we here?
No, it might be somebody famous, my child.
What's this? Wait there, dear.
Yes, he's dead, and it doesn't look a natural death to me.
They did, my dear, yes, but that isn't the answer here. (picks up the lyre.) They've left his belongings too.
Oh, they had plenty of time to drag him off the road.
Yes, well, there's nothing we can do for him now, my dear. No, nothing at all.
Stay here!
Good evening. Are you looking for somebody? Something?
Tell me, do you always wave that sword about like that?
Well, you can easily kill someone. Swords are dangerous, you know.
Yes, yes, thank you, that's better. Now tell me, whom or what, er, you, er, were you looking for?
Why? Why, have you lost one?
And what if it is, hmm?
Oh. Oh, I see. Yes.
Really? Most interesting.
If I am the man you're looking for, tell me why should I be harmed, hmm?
At court?
The Emperor. Nero, eh? Ha, ha, yes, of course, I have heard that he that he plucks a string or two. Yes, yes. Oh, the child, she travels with me. She keeps her eye on all the lyres.
Very well, we'll just attend to our imprimatur.
At court, I must be very important.
But why not, my child? I'm sure he knows more about this business than he admits. And we shall never get a better chance of meeting Nero.
Oh, of course I do, my dear. It, it, it, it's
Oh, yes, yes, quite, quite, my child. Yes.
I'm sure even Nero can play better than that!
The answer is of course, is not to be caught playing it!
Oh, so you want a fight do you?
Come on, my friend. What's the matter with you?
Young lady, why did you have to come in and interrupt? Just as I'd got him all softened up and ready for the old one, two.
All right? Of course, I'm all right, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the arts, the gentle art of fisticuffs.
My dear, I am one of the best. Do you know it was I that used to teach the Mountain Mauler of Montana!
Do you remember? Have you never heard? No, of course, no, no, of course you haven't, have you? No. Well, never mind, I think after all that wonderful exercise, I shall be able to get a very pleasant night's sleep. Right, off you go. Goodnight.
Why not? What, him? Oh, my dear child, I don't think he'll come back again. Oh, no. I think I can promise you that.
Well, I'm not surprised. It was he who obviously hired the man to kill me. Or rather to kill this fellow, Maximus what is it? Er.
What?
Yes, yes, of course, yes. I must remember that name. Yes. Goodnight.
Because this way he couldn't be charged with crime.
My dear, it was an accepted thing in this age to hire an assassin. Preferably, preferably someone dumb, and then he couldn't denounce you.
Just as I suspected at the time. Now, goodnight. And remember, we make an early start tomorrow.
Oh, goodness me, goodness me, child, how you do talk. Yes, we are.
Well, of course they might. But who am I to worry about such little things like that, hmm? Now then, there's one thing you've got to learn about me. When I say we go to Rome, then we go to Rome. Goodnight.
Oh, I don't see why not, my child. For a while, anyway. Then we must present our credentials so to speak, before night falls.
Now, now, now, now, don't tell me what I'm not going to do. I've been invited. I can't disappoint Nero.
Oh, er, nothing to interest you, my dear. We're going to Rome. Come along, don't let us delay.
I shouldn't think there's a soul in this place that knows me, my dear, so there's no cause for you to worry.
Oh, it isn't a matter of trying, my dear.
if I say, and don't make that funny noise.
Hmm? What is it?
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
What's happened?
The apodi-what?
Oh really, well done, well done, yes.
(quietly) Royal felicitations.
Caesar Nero, I
In person.
Hmm?
With such a great musician as yourself present, I would take the inspiration from your example, sire.
Beautiful, beautiful. Did you not hear that, my child? That instant composition?
Me? Well, I'll try, that is, with Caesar's permission.
That is the best I can do, I'm afraid.
That your excellency would be an impossibility. After such exquisite playing, I cannot presume. It would be out of the question. May I suggest that this instrument goes to your temple?
To the temple.
Er.
Well, I must say, I got out of that one rather well, hmm?
Yes. Hmm?
Oh, how should I know, my child? I can't for the life of me understand why I agreed to come here.
Me, curious? Huh, nonsense. Someone made a mistake. He thought he was talking with somebody else, I shouldn't wonder.
What?
No, no, no, no. We may as well look around, as you say.
Strange, very strange.
I'm quite aware of that, my child, but what does it all mean? What does it all mean, hmm?
Oh, good morning, my dear. Did you sleep well?
Oh, so, so. I must confess, I've been giving a great deal of thought to that business of yesterday and
Oh, there's our hissing friend again. Well? Well?
Which part of my action would you like me to put into effect first, hmm?
You, know my plans, of course?
There's some sort of conspiracy going on, my child, and I've decided for my own sake I must get to the bottom of it. The more I, the sooner I do it, the better.
Yes, hmm, what? Where are you going?
Very well, but don't leave the palace. It's big enough to get lost in anyway. And remember, we're only here as observers. We must not interfere with the course of progress, or try to accelerate man's achievements or progress.
Bye, yes. Well, I suppose the quickest way is to the top. Hmm. I must have a word with Nero.
Oh, Nero, I'd like a word with you.
I beg your pardon?
Extraordinary fellow. What an extraordinary fellow.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Madame. I wanted a word with Nero, but I'll come back later. He seems to be rather busy.
Of course I did, yes, of course I did. Take him away and banish him, and don't let him ever appear again here ever. Ever!
I congratulate you, Nero, the way you handled that stupid fellow! Why, dear, it was most impressive!
Oh, yes. It was enormous control.
Yes, I noticed that, of course, immediately. Yes.
You did say that perhaps we could have a little talk in here.
Not a word but I did want to ask you something now.
Oh, yes. On my arrival, I was rather under the impression that there was some sort of intrigue going on here, hmm?
Oh it's just a feeling, just a feeling, you know. After all, I mean, a musician with your skill, well, surely you've experienced troubled vibrations?
Yes, I'd rather thought you'd had it, hmm?
Oh, how charming of you! Thank you. I'm delighted, delighted.
Yes, yes, I rather thought it might be.
Too true! Too true so I shall.
Pardon me, Madame. I must go about my business.
No, I haven't, child, no. I raised the question with our illustrious Caesar but I'm afraid that was a mistake.
Never mind about that. Have you explored the court, hmm?
What? Haven't any idea.
Oh, so I heard, my dear. Yes, so I heard. And there's going to be rather an unusual entertainer.
Me!
So, you've had a busy day, Vicki? Hmm?
Really. What?
For heavens sake, child, keep quiet. What did you do?
And I told you not to interfere with history. Come along, quickly, quickly child!
Caesar Nero! Don't drink!
I have every reason to believe that drink is poisoned! Yes, thank heavens I got you in time.
Quite so, quite so. And now, if you'll excuse us, I have to practice. A great deal of practice before tonight's recital.
If he goes on eating, there won't be enough.
Of course, of course. But I must ask you if
I've no idea what he's talking about, child.
Oh, I'm not.
Can't I, child? Can't I?
Thank you! You are all so kind. With Caesar's permission? I would like to play my new composition in honour of this occasion. The music is so soft, so delicate, that only those with keen perceptive hearing, will be able to distinguish this melodious charm of music.
It's the old fairy story, child. The Emperor's New Clothes. Yes, I gave it as an idea to Hans Anderson.
You know what this is, child, don't you, hmm?
Yes. Caesar Nero made it. The rebuilding of Rome. Let me see, where are we now? 64AD, July. Yes, of course. He sets fire to Rome.
Yes, he must, I expect his plan will be ready at any time now.
Must you hiss my name from all corners, hmm?
Yes?
Oh, has he now? Well, I must have misjudged the fellow.
Oh, that will be charming.
Oh, obviously, hmm.
Yes, yes. Kill Nero? I beg your pardon?
Oh, yes, you did, did you? Yes.
Yes, but I arrived here, hmm?
And the Centurion who was killed by my allies, was the man that knew all about my plans and Nero didn't?
I shall certainly act on what you say, immediately.
Yes!
Well, that settles that little bit of intrigue. I'm a would-be murderer, am I? Well, we must be going, child. I want to leave here as soon as it's dark.
Now, now, now, there'll be no arguments. You will do as I say.
Oh, my dear Caesar Nero.
Well now, let me think. You want me play in the arena?
Well, it's no problem at all, after all, you want to do your very best for your fellow artists, well, why not the arena, hmm?
Yes, well I promise you I shall try to make it a roaring success.
Oh, yes, of course, of course, yes. Something serious, yes. Something they can really get their teeth into, hmm?
Caesar Nero, I've always wanted to put on a good show, to give a great performance.
After all, who knows? If I go down well, I might even make it my farewell performance. You see, I've always wanted to be considered as an artist of some taste. Generally regarded as, er, well er, palatable, hmm? But I must be boring you, oh I must! Surely you have so many other important things to attend to without standing here, chewing over the facts with me? Good gracious, there's something burning.
Well, there you are, release us. You heard what Nero said. Brilliant, brilliant. Let us go, will you, otherwise you'll be getting some of that alligator treatment. Go on, on your way. About your business. Go along.
We'd better be going, child and I want to leave here as soon as it's dark.
Wasn't going to work? What next. I never had any doubt in my mind, my dear.
This way child, and try and be quiet. The place is swarming with guards.
Oh, it's only us.
Good, good. I expect Ian and Barbara'll be wondering when we're going to get back.
Oh. The great fire of Rome, my dear. Hmm?
Yes, a most memorable occasion.
Hmm? Got it all wrong? What do you mean, child, hmm?
Of course not. Why should they?
I? Gave him?
It's got nothing to do with me.
Oh, yes, an accident.
Well, he could have, he could have, he would have been told someone else. You can't possibly accuse me of that.
Now look here, young lady, lets settle this. Insinuating that all this is my fault. Hmm? My fault.
Well, well, well, well.
Oh, what zest, what youthful exuberance! Try not to look at them, child. Their outburst of energy could make you go dizzy.
My dear Barbara. The young lady doesn't want to listen to people who have been idling away their days.
Well, now you've had a nice long holiday, I'm sure you can't wait to get back to the Tardis, hmm?
It'll have to keep. Have a grape. Come along, my dear.
Come along, lazy bones!
Hmm? Oh, Chesterton. Yes, you know, I wouldn't had thought it possible but somehow we've materialised for a split second of time and been imprisoned in some kind of force. I simply can't break its hold. Somewhere, somehow, we're being slowly dragged down.

What is it? What's happening?
What happened? I was.
The Doctor, I think. I was, er. I don't know, what happened? How
Chosen for what?
You have got to be kidding.
I can't open it.
What about this?
Don't tempt me.
I don't remember.
No, you're, you're nice. You're sweet. Everybody thinks you're sweet.
Yeah. Dead sweet.
It's a wall. Isn't there supposed to be a garden out there or something?
No, I've just got the Tardis. I remember.
We'd just left Raxacoriofallapatorius. Then we went to Kyoto. That's right, Japan in 1336, and we only just escaped.
We were together, we were laughing, and then there was this light. This white light coming through the walls, and then.
And then I woke up here.
Oh, Lynda with a Y. Sweet little Lynda. It's worse than that. I'm not just a passing traveller. No stupid little transmat gets inside my ship. That beam was fifteen million times more powerful, which means this isn't just a game. There's something else going on.
Well, here's the latest update from the Big Brother house. I'm getting out. I'm going to find my friends, and then I'm going to find you.
I'm busy getting out, thanks.
Well, maybe I'll be voted out, then.
It's only a game show. She'll make a fortune on the outside. Sell her story, release a record, fitness video, all of that. she'll be laughing.
What are they waiting for? Why don't they just let her go?
What was that?
Are you insane? You just step right into the disintegrator? Is it that important, getting your face on the telly? Is it worth dying for?
But I thought you had to apply.
How many? Sixty?
It's a charnel house! What about the winners? What do they get?
Is that it?
Rose is out there. She got caught in the transmat. She's a contestant. Time I got out. That other contestant, er, Linda with an I. She was forcibly evicted for what?
What, like this?
Blaidd Drwg.
Bad Wolf.
That's more like it. Come on, then. Open up!
Come on then, disintegrate me! Come on, what're you waiting for?
Disintegrate me. What are you waiting for?
Ah, ha! I knew it! You see, someone brought me into this game. If they'd wanted me dead, they could've transmatted me into a volcano.
They want me alive.
Maybe security isn't as tight this end. Are you following this? I'm getting out!
Come with me.
Stay in there, you've got a fifty fifty chance of disintegration. Stay with me, I promise I'll get you out alive. Come on!
Lynda, you're sweet. From what I've seen of your world, do you think anyone votes for sweet?
Hold on. I've been here before. This is Satellite Five. No guards. That makes a change. You'd think a big business like Satellite Five would be armed to the teeth.
A hundred years exactly. It's the year two zero zero one zero zero. I was here before, Floor one three nine. The Satellite was broadcasting news channels back then. Had a bit of trouble upstairs. Nothing too serious. Easy. Gave them a hand, home in time for tea.
Yep!
I moisturise. Funny sorts of readings. All kinds of energy. The place is humming. It's weird. This goes way beyond normal transmissions. What would they need all that power for?
I had two friends travelling with me. They must've got caught in the same transmat. Where would they be?
Like what?
And you watch this stuff?
Never paid for my licence.
Let them try.
It doesn't matter.
I'm just a traveller, wandering past. Believe it or not, all I'm after is a quiet life.
Fast as I can.
Maybe you could.
I wouldn't mind if you did. Not a bad idea, Lynda with a Y. But first of all, we've got to concentrate on the getting out. And to do that, you've got to know your enemy. Who's controlling it? Who's in charge of the satellite now?
What's happened to it?
So the population just sits there? Half the world's too fat, and half the world's too thin, and you lot just watch telly?
The Human Race. Brainless sheep being fed on a diet of. Mind you, have they still got that programme where three people have to live with a bear?
And me. The celebrity edition where the bear got in the bath.
But it's all gone wrong. I mean, history's gone wrong again. This should be the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. I don't understand. Last time I was here I put it right.
But that was me. I did that.
Oh, my. I made this world.
Can't you track her down?
If I can just get inside this computer. She's got to be here somewhere.
Do you think I don't know that?
Thanks.
Do you mind flirting outside?
For you, that's flirting.
It's not compatible. This stupid system doesn't make sense.
This place should be a basic broadcaster, but the systems are twice as complicated. It's more than just television. This station's transmitting something else.
I don't know. This whole Bad Wolf thing's tied up with me. Someone's manipulated my entire life. It's some sort of trap and Rose is stuck inside it.
Found her. Floor four oh seven.
Come on, come on.!
Game Room Six, which one is it??
You can't. it's made of Hydra combination.
Come on, come on, come on.
Rose! Stop this game!
I order you to stop this game!
Let's do it. (Jack leads the fight out. The two guards are knocked out and Jack reclaims his Defabricator while the Doctor retrieves his sonic screwdriver. Lynda takes the guard's weapons.)
Floor 500.
Who's in charge of this place?
This Satellite's more than a Game Station.
Who killed Rose Tyler?
I want an answer!
: Oh, don't be so thick. Like I was ever going to shoot.
Captain, we've got more guards on the way up. Secure the exits.
You. What were you saying?
Okay, so shoot me. Why can't she answer?
If you want. Just hurry up.
What's her name?
Keep an eye on them.
Show me.
That's the same staff who execute hundreds of contestants every day.
And with that sentence you just lost the right to even talk to me. Now back off!
Whatever it is, you can wait.
I'm here.
What do you want?
Who are your masters?
My friend died inside your games.
Don't you dare tell me that.
Who are they?
Who are they?
Tell me, who are they?
When's the next solar flare?
Fat lot of good that is.
We're not leaving now.
But you killed her!
She's out there somewhere.
Don't, the solar flare's gone. They'll hear you.
They took her.
There's a time and a place.
Going way back. Installing the Jagrafess a hundred years ago. Someone's been playing a long game, controlling the human race from behind the scenes for generations.
It looks like nothing because that's what this satellite does. Underneath the transmission there's another signal.
Hiding whatever's out there. Hiding it from sonar, radar, scanner. There's something sitting right on top of planet Earth, but it's completely invisible. If I cancel the signal
Obviously, they survived.
Two hundred ships. More than two thousand on board each one. That's just about half a million of them.
Daleks.
Oh, will you? That's nice. Hello!
Oh, really? Why's that, then?
No.
I said no.
It means no.
No!
Because this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to rescue her.
I'm going to save Rose Tyler from the middle of the Dalek fleet
And then I'm going to save the Earth, and then, just to finish off, I'm going to wipe every last stinking Dalek out of the sky!
Yeah. And doesn't that scare you to death. Rose?
I'm coming to get you.

Clara. Clara!
The invasion has happened.You're probably surrounded by Zygons.Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe.Apparently my plane is never going to land.Let's see what we can do about that!
Missed!
Any questions?
Er, camouflage.
Yes, we're in Britain. Oh, your specs are broken. I'll fix them. You can wear mine, they're sonic.
Yeah.
What's wrong with pointless? I once invented an invisible watch. Spot the design flaw.
Don't look at my browser history.
Yeah, I saiddon't.
She did blow us up with her big bazooka. This is us being blown up with a big bazooka.
Thanks.
Again, thank you.
Ah, yes. Why limit yourself? You've really thought this through, haven't you?
Yes.
I don't know. I'm still in the hope phase.
Hell. Please talk about something else.
Don't think of them as rational. They're different. They don't care about human beings, they don't care about their own people. They think the rest of Zygonkind are traitors.
It's a splinter group.
The Zygon who probably killed her. Read it.
What does that mean? A political awakening? Why would she be sending me propaganda? She just blew me up with a big bazooka.
She was amazing.
How?
Texting?
You don't know. It's just a theory.
Worse than ever.
Hello! Hi! Hello.
Doctor John Disco. It was my plane. I had a big plane for purposes of er, poncing about.
It went off with a massive bang about half a mile that way? Actually, er, It's fine. We're, we're fine, aren't we?
Yes, yes, yes, we're fine. Just, er, move along. (quietly to Osgood)Come on.
Hello.
Yes, well, I'm dead now, and I think I might be a bit more dead in a minute. What's your plan, Zygella?
Come on, you don't invade planets without having kind of plan. That's why they're calledplanets, to remind you to
And you're winking at me.
You do know what winking means? You're sending out some very mixed messages here.You know I'm over two thousand years old? I'm old enough to be your Messiah.
We need some wheels. The van!
Okay. Non-verbal communication. I assume that you never bothered to learn Morse code. (sotto) Specs! Setting 137.
Okay, we'll have to try something else. Twenty questions. Where's your pod? Is it in a tunnel? Is it in London?
Thanks very much. Gotcha!
Stay where you are, Clara. We're coming to get you. And for God's sake, don't let her into your memories.
Obviously.
The mind of Clara Oswald. She may never find her way out. (he chuckles.)
Dazzling, isn't it?
Ah, London. Perpetual city, cradle of culture, here we come! Clara, stay safe.
London! What a dump.
No, it's not, it's a dump.
I spend an awful lot of time being kidnapped, tortured, shot at and exterminated. Doesn't mean I like it.
There's electricity in the air.
What's your name?
No, no, no. Your first name?
Basil.
Let's just, er, stick with what we had. I need to ask you, because it's important, because it might matter.
Which one are you? Human or Zygon?
: We can help you.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
Please! Come back! Come back!
I can't help you just now, but
I understand.
We're on your side.
Listen, we are not them.
No, no, no! Stop! Stop! Stop,
There it is, Osgood. There's their plan.
Unmask everyone, provoke fear, paranoia, provoke a war.
Kate! Are you all right?
It's just I'd heard otherwise.
Well, how very convenient, because that's just exactly what we're looking for.
Well, they like a good cave, don't they? How many of these pods are occupied?
Which one is Clara's?
Oh, you cheeky little monkeys!
Two Osgoods, two boxes. Operation Double. What did you expect?
One box normalises all the Zygons.
Destroys them.
Ah, that would be telling.
No. This is war. You pull the trigger, you pay the price.
The blue one! The blue one! The blue one normalises all your people.
No, I'm not. And when you open up the box, you'll see I'm not lying.
Yeah, I know.
You're you.
How did you survive?
Why does peacekeeping always involve killing?
Is this the lot?
Twenty million Zygons about to be unmasked. You don't know whether they are human or not. And you can't fight them, not with soldiers.
Oh, I was really hoping that it wouldn't.
Well, you know how it is. Daddy knows best.
Let me negotiate peace. You can't commit mass murder
The boxes are safeguards for both species. You agreed to that.
Yes, you did, then I wiped your memory. And you agreed to that, too. But that's why there were two Osgoods to police the ceasefire. One human and one Zygon, to keep the secrets and keep the peace.
Hi! Hello! Hello!
Oh, hello! Hi. Hi. Stop this. Stop this, please. Let me take both of these boxes away. We'll forgive, we'll forget. And the ceasefire will stand.
This is the moment we've all been waiting for. Make your mindup time!
: One of those buttons will destroy the Zygons, release the imbecile's gas. The other one detonates the nuclear warhead under the Black Archive. It'll destroy everyone in London. Bonnie. Bonnie, sweetheart! One of those buttons will unmask every Zygon in the world. The other one cancels their ability to change form. It'll make them human beings for ever. (normal) There are safeguards beyond safeguards. I did this on a very important day for me and this ceasefire
No, it's not.
No, I'm not.
No.
No, it's not. It's
So did I.
So what.
So's everyone.
Oh, it's not fair! Oh, I didn't realise that it was not fair! Well, you know what? My Tardis doesn't work properly and I don't have my own personal tailor.
These things have happened, Zygella. They are facts.
What is it that you actually want?
Ah. Ah, right. And when this war is over, when you have a homeland free from humans, what do you think it's going to be like? Do you know? Have you thought about it? Have you given it any consideration? Because you're very close to getting what you want. What's it going to be like? Paint me a picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work? Will there be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be allowed to play violins? Who's going to make the violins? Well? Oh, you don't actually know, do you? Because, like every other tantrumming child in history, Bonnie, you don't actually know what you want. So, let me ask you a question about this brave new world of yours. When you've killed all the bad guys, and when it's all perfect and just and fair, when you have finally got it exactly the way you want it, what are you going to do with the people like you? The troublemakers. How are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one?
Oh, will you? Well, maybe, maybe you
Because I want to get you to see, and I'm almost there!
And we're off! Fingers on buzzers! Are you feeling lucky? Are you ready to play the game? Who's going to be quickest? Who's going to be luckiest?
No, it's not a game, sweetheart, and I mean that most sincerely.
Because it's not a game, Kate. This is a scale model of war. Every war ever fought, right there in front of you. Because it's always the same. When you fire that first shot, no matter how right you feel, you have no idea who's going to die! You don't know whose children are going to scream and burn! How many hearts will be broken! How many lives shattered! How much blood will spill until everybody does until what they were always going to have to do from the very beginning. Sit down and talk! (sigh) Listen to me. Listen, I just, I just want you to think. Do you know what thinking is? It's just a fancy word for changing your mind.
Then you will die stupid. Alternatively, you could step away from that box, you can walk right out of that door and you could stand your revolution down.
You're all the same, you screaming kids. You know that?Look at me, I'm unforgivable. Well, here's the unforeseeable. I forgive you. After all you've done, I forgive you.

Thank you. Thank you.
I know. I know. Thank you. (to Clara-Z) Well?
Of course. And do you know how you know that? Because you've started to think like me.
:It's hell, isn't it? No one should have to think like that. And no one will. Not on our watch. (their eyes meet) Gotcha.
Because you have a disadvantage, Zygella. I know that face.
No, well, er, you've said that the last fifteen times.
No. Just Kate's. Oh, and your little friend's here, of course. (the Zygons) When they wake up, they won't remember what you've done. It'll be our secret.
Because I've been where you have. There was another box. I was going to press another button. I was going to wipe out all of my own kind, man, woman and child. I was so sure I was right.
The same thing that happened to you. I let Clara Oswald get inside my head. Trust me. She doesn't leave.
The Tardis.
What? You're kidding me? Surely you know that?
I made it up from the initials. It stands forTotally And Radically Driving In Space. Do you want to come? All of the future, all of history, and all of the universe?
Fair enough. Clara, would you mind er
I'll see you in the Tardis, okay?
I need to know. Which one are you?
Human or Zygon?
(stuttering) But I don't, I don't. How, how?
Zygella?
But which one of you
You're a credit to your species, Petronella Osgood.
Oh, and you should know. I'm a very big fan.
Yeah.
Longest month of my life.
I'll be the judge of time.

Nah, nothing here. Well, nothing dangerous. Well, not that dangerous. You know what, I'll just have a quick scan, in case there's anything dangerous.
About three thousand years into your future, give or take.
Fifty first century. Diagmar Cluster, you're a long way from home, Mickey. Two and a half galaxies.
Dear me, had some cowboys in here. Got a ton of repair work going on. Now that's odd. Look at that. All the warp engines are going. Full capacity. There's enough power running through this ship to punch a hole in the universe, but we're not moving. So where's all that power going?
Good question. No life readings on board.
No, I've checked all the smoking pods. Can you smell that?
Well, there's something you don't see in your average spaceship. Eighteenth century. French. Nice mantle. Not a hologram. It's not even a reproduction. This actually is an eighteenth century French fireplace. Double sided. There's another room through there.
Hello.
What's your name?
Reinette, that's a lovely name. Can you tell me where you are at the moment, Reinette?
And where's your bedroom? Where do you live, Reinette?
Paris, right!
Oh, it's just a routine fire check. Can you tell me what year it is?
Right, lovely. One of my favourites. August is rubbish though. Stay indoors. Okay, that's all for now. Thanks for your help. Hope you enjoy the rest of the fire. Night, night.
I also said this ship was generating enough power to punch a hole in the universe. I think we just found the hole. Must be a spatio-temporal hyperlink.
No idea. Just made it up. Didn't want to say magic door.
Well, she was speaking French. Right period French, too.
Gotcha!
It's okay. Don't scream. It's me. It's the fireplace man. Look. We were talking just a moment ago. I was in your fireplace.
Really? Oh. Must be a loose connection. Need to get a man in.
Okay, that's scary.
Just a bit scared, yeah. Just a little tiny bit. Because, you see, if this clock's broken, and it's the only clock in the room, then what's that?
Because, you see, that's not a clock. You can tell by the resonance. Too big. Six feet, I'd say. The size of a man.
Now, let's think. If you were a thing that ticked and you were hiding in someone's bedroom, first thing you do, break the clock. No one notices the sound of one clock ticking, but two? You might start to wonder if you're really alone. Stay on the bed. Right in the middle. Don't put your hands or feet over the edge.
Reinette (whispers) Don't look round.
You, stay exactly where you are. Hold still, let me look.
You've been scanning her brain. What, you've crossed two galaxies and thousands of years just to scan a child's brain? What could there be in a little girl's mind worth blowing a hole in the universe?
Incomplete? What's that mean, incomplete? You can answer her, you can answer me. What do you mean, incomplete?
Just a nightmare, Reinette, don't worry about it. Everyone has nightmares.
Even monsters from under the bed have nightmares, don't you, monster?
Me!
Fire extinguisher.
Here.
Field trip to France. Some kind of basic camouflage protocol. Nice needlework, shame about the face.
Oh, you are beautiful! No, really, you are. You're gorgeous! Look at that. Space age clockwork, I love it. I've got chills! Listen, seriously, I mean this from the heart, and, by the way, count those, it would be a crime, it would be an act of vandalism to disassemble you. But that won't stop me.
Short range teleport. Can't have got far. Could still be on board.
Don't go looking for it!
Back in a sec.
Reinette? Just checking you're okay.
Oh. Hello. Er, I was just looking for Reinette. This is still her room, isn't it? I've been away, not sure how long.
Reinette! Well. Goodness, how you've grown.
Right, yes, sorry. Listen, lovely to catch up, but better be off, eh? Don't want your mother finding you up here with a strange man, do we?
Yeah, I suppose you have. I came the quick route.
Oh, you never want to listen to reason
Poisson? Reinette Poisson? No! No, no, no, no, no way. Reinette Poisson? Later Madame Etoiles? Later still mistress of Louis the Fifteenth, uncrowned Queen of France? Actress, artist, musician, dancer, courtesan, fantastic gardener!
I'm the Doctor, and I just snogged Madame de Pompadour. Ha, ha!
Rose! Mickey! Every time.
Every time, it's rule one. Don't wander off. I tell them, I do. Rule one. There could be anything on this ship.
Rose?
Will you stop following me? I'm not your mother.
So this is where you came from, eh, horsey?
The King of France.
Oh, this and that. Became the imaginary friend of a future French aristocrat, picked a fight with a clockwork man.
Oh, and I met a horse.
Mickey, what's pre-Revolutionary France doing on a spaceship? Get a little perspective. See these? They're all over the place. On every deck. Gateways to history. But not just any old history.
Hers. Time windows deliberately arranged along the life of one particular woman. A spaceship from the fifty first century stalking a woman from the eighteenth. Why?
Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, known to her friends as Reinette. One of the most accomplished women who ever lived.
No, he's already got a Queen. She's got plans of being his mistress.
I think this is the night they met. The night of the Yew Tree ball. In no time at flat, she'll get herself established as his official mistress, with her own rooms at the palace. Even her own title. Madame de Pompadour.
Oh, she did. They get on very well.
France. It's a different planet.
Hello, Reinette. Hasn't time flown?
Switching back on. Melting the ice.
Then it kills everyone in the room. Focuses the mind, doesn't it? Who are you? Identify yourself. Order it to answer me.
I don't know. It did when you were a child. Let's see if you've still got it.
What happened to the ship, then? There was a lot of damage.
That ship hasn't moved in over a year. What's taken you so long?
What's happened to the crew? Where are they?
There should have been over fifty people on your ship. Where did they go?
Fifty people don't just disappear. Where. Oh. You didn't have the parts, so you used the crew.
It was just doing what it was programmed to. Repairing the ship any way it can, with whatever it could find. No one told it the crew weren't on the menu. What did you say the flight deck smelt of?
Flesh plus heat. Barbeque. But what are you doing here? You've opened up time windows. That takes colossal energy. Why come here? You could have gone to your repair yard. Instead you come to eighteenth century France? Why?
Then why haven't you taken it?
What, so, that's the plan, then. Just keep opening up more and more time windows, scanning her brain, checking to see if she's done yet.
Reinette, no.
It's back on the ship. Rose, take Mickey and Arthur. Get after it. Follow it. Don't approach it, just watch what it does.
Good name for a horse.
I let you keep Mickey. Now go! Go! Go!
Reinette, you're going to have to trust me. I need to find out what they're looking for. There's only one way I can do that. It won't hurt a bit.
Oh dear, Reinette. You've had some cowboys in here.
If there's anything you don't want me to see, just imagine a door and close it. I won't look. Oh, actually there's a door just there. You might want to cl. Oh, actually, several.
I don't make a habit of it.
What age are you?
No, not my question, theirs. You're twenty three and for some reason, that means you're not old enough. Sorry, you might find old memories reawakening. Side effect.
It'll pass. Stay with me.
What do you mean, alone? You've never been alone in your life. When did you start calling me Doctor?
How did you do that?
I can't.
This is the night you dance with the King.
I can't.
What did you see?
I could've danced all night, I could've danced all night
And still have begged for more. I could've spread my wings and done a thou. Have you met the French? My god, they know how to party.
Oh, you sound just like your mother.
Well, among other things, I think just invented the banana daiquiri a few centuries early. Do you know, they've never even seen a banana before. Always take a banana to a party, Rose. Bananas are good. Oh ho, ho, ho, ho, brilliant. It's you. You're my favourite, you are. You are the best! Do you know why? Because you're so thick. You're Mister Thick Thick Thickity Thick Face from Thicktown, Thickania. And so's your dad. Do you know what they were scanning Reinette's brain for? Her milometer. They want to know how old she is. Know why? Because this ship is thirty seven years old, and they think that when Reinette is thirty seven, when she's complete, then her brain will be compatible. So, that's what you're missing, isn't it, hmm? Command circuit. Your computer. Your ship needs a brain. And for some reason, God knows what, only the brain of Madame de Pompadour will do.
Compatible? If you believe that, you probably believe this is a glass of wine.
Multigrain anti-oil. If it moves, it doesn't.
Right, you two, that's enough lying about. Time we got the rest of the ship turned off.
Yeah. Safe. Safe and thick, way I like them. Okay. All the time windows are controlled from here. I need to close them all down. Zeus plugs. Where are my Zeus plugs? I had them a minute ago. I was using them as castanets.
With the amount of damage to these circuits, they did well to hit the right century. Trial and error after that. The windows aren't closing. Why won't they close?
I don't know. Incoming message?
Report from the field. One of them must still be out there with Reinette. That's why I can't close the windows. There's an override.
Well, that was a bit clever.
Right. Many things about this are not good. Message from one of your little friends? Anything interesting?
One of them must have found the right time window. Now it's time to send in the troops. And this time they're bringing back her head.
They knew I was coming. They blocked it off.
They teleported. You saw them. As long as the ship and the ballroom are linked, their short range teleports will do the trick.
We can't use the Tardis. We're part of events now.
Hyperplex this side, plate glass the other. We need a truck.
I know we don't have a truck!
No. Smash the glass, smash the time window. There'd be no way back.
Madame de Pompadour. You look younger every day.
Yeah? Well, I'm the Lord of Time, and I'm here to fix the clock.
Forget it. It's over. For you and for me. Talk about seven years bad luck. Try three thousand.
The link with the ship is broken. No way back. You don't have the parts. How many ticks left in that clockwork heart, huh? A day? An hour? It's over. Accept that. I'm not winding you up.
You all right?
They've stopped. They have no purpose now.
What's in a name? Names are just titles. Titles don't tell you anything.
Like Madame de Pompadour.
From time to time.
Mmm. Pretty much.
Yeah, I did, didn't I? Catch me doing that again.
When the mirror broke, the shock would have severed all the links with the ship. There'll be a few more broken mirrors and torn tapestries around here, I'm afraid, wherever there was a time window. I'll, I'll pay for any damage. Er, that's a thought, I'm going to need money. I was always a bit vague about money. Where do you get money?
Yep, the slow path. Here's to the slow path.
Well, I'm not going anywhere.
The fireplace. The fireplace from your bedroom. When did you do this?
You broke the bond with the ship when you moved it, which means it was offline when the mirror broke. That's what saved it. But the link is basically physical, and it's still physically here. Which might just mean, if I'm lucky. If I'm very, very, very, very, very, very lucky.
Ah ha!
Loose connection.
Need to get a man in.
Wish me luck!
Madame de Pompadour! Still want to see those stars?
Give me two minutes. Pack a bag.
Go to the window. Pick a star, any star.
How long did you wait?
Great. Always wait five and a half hours.
Explain later. Into the Tardis. Be with you in a sec.
Reinette? You there, Reinette?
Reinette? Oh, hello.
Ah.
We'll probably never know. There was massive damage in the computer memory banks. It probably got confused. The Tardis can close down the time windows now the droids are gone. Should stop it causing any more trouble.
I'm always all right.

Jamie! You're right! We'd better just check, though.
Well, let's see shall we?
Yes, yes. That's the dark side of the moon. We seem to have stopped in space.
Shush, Zoe. That light on the Moon's surface. Do you see it?
Zoe, that's a missile!
Now don't fuss me, Zoe.
Well, it's the landing circuit. It seems to have jammed. That's why we're stuck in space. Ah.
Oh, the stupid thing! Oh!
Yes, I'm sorry about that, Jamie. Are you all right, Zoe?
Yes. Unless they knew already.
Yes, let's have a look.
We're certainly not on the moon's surface, are we.
It merely needs an overhaul, Jamie, just like any piece of machinery.
No, no. We shall have to see if we can get some made. Lets have a further look, shall we?
Oh yes, it could be twentieth century. England in summertime, I should say. See the rain clouds? We might try and look up our old friend Professor Travers in London. He might be able to help us.
Yes. Always supposing he's not a baby or a schoolboy. Now, come along. Let's just collect this circuit, and I think I'd better see this one. There. It's all right. It's just a fault in the visual stabiliser circuit. We'd better take that too.
Come along, take my hand.
I wonder if you could help us?
We're trying to get to London.
Oh, that's very civil of you.
Is something wrong?
Well, you see, we're strangers around here.
No.
Well, that's rather a long story. You see
This company, what do they do?
Well, no, we've been a little out of touch.
Your people?
We'll find out later. Keep down.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Can you give us a lift to London?
In you get.
Here we are. Right. That's odd. It says Watkins.
Well, the telephone directory definitely said number eighteen. We'll ask.
Oh, I'm sorry miss, but we wondered whether you could help us? We wondered if
Oh dear. Perhaps I could help you.
Yes, a little. I see
You're taking photos of yourself?
Please let me answer one question at a time.
It's all right, it's a very simple mechanism. Who is your uncle?
Oh. Then Professor Travers doesn't live here?
What field of science is your uncle in?
Well that is fortunate. Perhaps he might be able to help us. Is he at home?
Well, where is he?
Oh yes, that's all right.
Miss.
Miss?
Have you any idea when your uncle is going to be back?
Can't you get in touch with him?
They? Now who is they?
You mean your uncle has gone to work for these people? Well, surely we can get in touch with him.
Thank you.
Three.
Four.
Two.
Oh, I'm sure of it.
Ah, Jamie. You mustn't let your imagination run away with you. I must admit, it's a bit strange.
I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins.
Oh, yes, you see, but this is very important.
Yes, but I must speak with him.
But this is an automatic answering device! Ah, shut up, you stupid machine!
There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go there ourselves.
No, it was stupid simple-minded computer answering service.
Jamie and I are going to this place. Come on, Zoe.
Oh well, come on, Jamie. Oh, the address?
Oh, thank you.
I thought so.
More stupid computers. Automatic receptionists. Right.
I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins.
Then I would like to speak with someone in authority.
That's no good. I wish to speak with somebody now.
But I insist. This is an emergency!
It's a private matter.
Oh shut up, you stupid machine! Diabolical inventions.
Come on.
Well, there must be somebody else in this building except these stupid machines. Come on.
Wait!
Thank you.
Jamie. I think perhaps it is we who should be apologising to you, Mister
Yes, it is.
Oh, I see.
No, I don't think so, thank you very much.
Well, I
Yes, I.
Oh, how very kind.
Yes, that's how you turn it off, Jamie.
Yes, of course. Come along, Jamie.
Doctor. Goodbye.
Jamie!
Hmm?
Yes. That fellow's not what he seems.
No, no, no. I mean Vaughn. The normal range of human blinking is about once every ten or fifteen seconds. Vaughn was blinking far less frequently than that.
Oh I'm not joking, Jamie. Underneath all that charm there was something odd. Sinister. Almost inhuman.
Accept the situation, Jamie. There's nothing else we can do.
It's Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart!
I've told you over and over again, Jamie. Time is relative.
Yes, we're still travelling. Yes.
Any more unbelievable than the Yetis?
But what's all this, and why all the cloak and dagger stuff to bring us here?
How nice.
Oh thank you, and a patty cake biscuit. Thank you.
But what's so odd about people going into the building?
And all these people went into the building, the IE building, and didn't come out.
Odd?
Jamie, yes.
I expect that he's all right. He was all right this morning when we left him. Brigadier, tell me more about this International Electromatics set-up.
Oh, Jamie, don't
Put it away.
But what's your interest in this?
I see. I don't suppose you have any authority to search the building, have you?
Well, it looks to me if Jamie and I want to find the Professor, we'll have to find him in our own way.
Is that a tank?
Jolly good.
Oh yes, that's splendid. Yes, this should come in very handy.
Zoe? Isobel?
Look, Jamie, sandwiches. I'm hungry. Want one?
Oh, Jamie. How can I think when you've got that thing on?
All right, all right.
All right! I just want to take a look at it, that's all. Oh, yes. It's an interesting little piece of
Well, well, well. What have we here?
There's a micro-monolithic circuit in the back plate of this radio.
It's a very complex circuit in miniature.
It has nothing to do with the radio, as far as I can see.
All right!
I suggest that we try the wall.
Isobel never writes anything on paper. You can't lose a wall, remember. JAMIE: Oh. Ah! Tired of waiting. Gone to IE offices to look for you. Zoe and Isobel. DOCTOR: Jamie! We'd better go after them.
Jamie! We'd better go after them.
There's no one in there except that stupid computer, and that's won't tell us anything.
Well, if the Brigadier's men are still around, they should have seen them go in. Hello?
Hello, could I speak to the Brigadier?
What a splendid little toy this is, Jamie.
Jamie, just a minute please. Brigadier.
These clothes. Did they include a rather brightly-coloured feather boa?
Yes, I'm afraid they are.
All right, all right, Jamie. Brigadier, we're going to try to get into the building and try to find them.
Thanks.
Yes, of course, Jamie. Come on.
That's incredible!
The ease with which that man carried that crate.
Let's go and see.
It's odd, Jamie, it's distinctly odd.
Yes.
Yes.
There must be a door to the main building somewhere.
No, Jamie. Wait.
The guards! Come on.
Jamie, Jamie. We came here looking for two friends of ours.
Where are they now?
Jamie, Jamie. It would set our minds at rest if we could take a look inside those boxes.
How kind.
Well, that's very civil of you.
Oh. really?
Thank you.
Oh, how kind.
Really?
Oh, that's quite simple. I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them.
Why do you say that?
Oh, how kind.
Yes.
I haven't forgotten them, Jamie.
Jamie, we're not going to help Zoe by annoying Mister Vaughn, are we?
He's too nice.
I don't know. He was a little bit too interested in these circuits for my liking.
Well, I don't see how he could do.
Yes, but that's what worrying me.
Well, if Vaughn has anything to hide, why is he letting us talk to Watkins?
Yes, Jamie, I can see. Let's have a closer look at that, shall we?
Now just hold still a minute. Keep your shoulder still. That's odd. That's very odd.
Well, it looks like a deep space radio communication system. What's it's doing here?
Yes, it could be.
Yes, yes, they went to America, didn't they?
Oh yes.
Well, it's a long story.
So we went to see Mister Vaughn. He said that you were working on something important.
Jamie, Jamie, I don't think the Professor wants to hear about that.
Professor, I think that I should warn you that Anne Travers allowed her imagination to run a little wild.
Jamie, I think that there are other more important things to talk about at the moment.
Professor, tell us about what you're doing here.
Oh yes? A teaching machine?
No, no, not entirely. There's my friend the Brigadier, remember.
Possibly. But quickly, tell me, what is Vaughn up to? What's he doing here?
I wonder. I've a nasty feeling he's aiming somewhat higher than that.
Oh, how kind.
All right.
Oh dear. You know, Jamie, I've always been rather scared of lifts.
I never even like to start them. You'll have to push the button.
Yes, Jamie. Do as you're told.
Packer! Mister Packer, I obviously can't let you hurt Zoe, and so I'll have to tell you all want to know, now.
Yes, I'm sure that Mister Vaughn will. Oh, there he is now.
Your knife.
Your knife. Give me your knife.
I'm going to try and break the circuit.
It will either stop the lift, or send us out of control.
We'll have to take that risk. Hold tight, here we go.
There was a fifty-fifty chance, you know, Jamie.
No, no, it's the lift that's stuck, not us. Look.
Out into the lift shaft, I imagine. Quickly, on me back.
Jamie.
Thank you, Jamie. Oh my word! Well, that's a long way up, isn't it? Oh well, we'd better get cracking before they realise what's happened. Perhaps I'd better shut this.
Oh, that's simple.
We get squashed.
I'm very much afraid it is. Come on!
Yes, we will! Come on!
It's stopped. They must be checking. Come on, they may guess where we are and come after us.
Hurry, Jamie! Hurry!
Come on, Jamie.
No, come on. Let's see where we are.
Down there.
Well, we can't go down the lift again, can we? Hello. There's a fire escape. Come on.
It could be.
Yes.
Jamie! Hide! Quickly, hide!
Jamie. Jamie!
Shush.
I think the guards are still out there.
Keep your voice down.
Alive? Jamie, the darkness plays funny tricks with the imagination.
Are you sure?
All right, let's have a closer look.
Wait. We'll follow in a few moments.
No, no, not yet. We've got to rescue the girls first. Tenth floor, central block. Come on.
I should think that's the central block, wouldn't you, Jamie?
Stop looking for problems, Jamie. Let's get along up there, shall we?
There's just about time enough to effect a simple rescue operation. Come along, Jamie.
Yes, come along.
Good. As long they don't give the game away too soon.
Brigadier, I think we shall require a little assistance in a few moments.
No, but we shall need help. You have a helicopter in the area?
I wonder, have they a rope ladder on board.
We're just going up to the roof of the main building. That is the central block on the north side. That should give your helicopter cover should there be any ground fire. Have you got that?
No, no, of course not. Help me to get this over the side there.
Right. Down you go, Jamie.
Well done, Jamie.
I'm afraid it isn't quite yet, Isobel.
Come on, Jamie. Hurry up!
Get us out of here! Hold on, Jamie!
Hmm? Jamie, that object on the other side of the moon.
Mmm? Yeah.
And then there was that deep space radio transmitter. I wonder.
Did anyone, by any chance, photograph any of these objects?
Oh, if you would be so kind.
Unidentified Flying Objects.
Possibly. How long ago were these objects first sighted?
Jamie, when you were hiding in that crate, you say something moved?
Did you recognise it at all?
I don't know. We've got to find out and quickly.
Well, obviously they bring these things, whatever they are, up from the factory in the country to the London premises. That's where we're going to find the answer.
Jamie, we have to find what is inside these crates. Brigadier, have you got a map? Including the London premises.
Oh yes, I see.
Oh my word. How very fortunate.
Brigadier, you don't, by any chance, know where I can find a canoe?
Yes, yes. Now come on.
Go on, I'm holding it steady.
Jamie, I'm afraid I was right.
Shush.
I don't know, Jamie, but they're here, aren't they?! Come on, let's go back to the canoe.
Yes, I'm afraid it's true, Zoe.
They're from another world. Inhuman killers.
Yes.
Oh, there's hundreds of them, possibly thousands.
That deep space radio transmitter is obviously being used by the Cybermen spaceships to home in on.
I don't know, Jamie. Captain, where's the Brigadier.
No, no, Captain. The people who went into Vaughn's headquarters were different when they came out, weren't they?
Who is the Brigadier is immediately answerable to?
Oh, dear.
You see, a network of tunnels underneath London.
Yes. And look. There's a main flood relief sewer running right underneath the warehouse.
Oh no, no. Besides, many of these tunnels are dry and only flood during heavy rainfall.
It might be better at the moment to find out what form this attack's going to take. Jamie?
That transistor radio that Vaughn gave you. Have you still got it?
Brigadier, have you any IE equipment here?
May I see them, please?
Thank you.
This is rather like looking for the proverbial needle in the proverbial. Just a minute
I don't know. Wait a minute.
Yes. Yes, I'm almost sure that this is same sort of circuit that was in Jamie's radio.
I've no idea. But it's certainly not part of that equipment. Have a look.
Oh, it does something, all right. The question is what?
No, I'm afraid not. What I really need is laboratory facilities. I'm sure that this micro-monolithic circuit is something to do with the Cybermen's invasion plan.
Oh, no, that's no problem, I can go up to London and use Professor Watkins' laboratory at Travers's house.
Thank you.
Brigadier?
Where's Jamie and Zoe and Isobel.
London? What on earth for?
What's the matter? What's happened?
What?
I'd better go back to London with him and see if I can make some sort of sense of these circuits. I'm going to have to leave my three friends in your very capable hands.
Thank you.
No, not yet. There's an alien logic in these circuits but I haven't been able to work it out yet.
No, not yet.
How long will that take?
But that might be too late!
Yes of course!
It could be, it just could be.
Oh, thank you.
No, no, no, no, no!
Brigadier, if you could rescue him, he might be able to help us with our problem.
(You've no idea what these micro-monolithic circuits are for.
Oh, my word.
You say he's going to mass produce these machines?
I've no idea. Unless. Professor! You say that you developed this machine to produce excessively powerful emotional pulses.
Well, that's it! Vaughn going to use it as a weapon against the Cybermen once he has no further use for them.
Yes. Emotion is alien to the Cybermen's nervous system. It'll destroy it. The micro-monolithic circuits. They're emotional circuits! No wonder they weren't logical. Now why didn't I think of this before. Now, let's see.
Let's hope it isn't. Oh, how do you do, Jamie? Now then, here is the Earth. And here is the Moon.
And these are the communication satellites circling the Earth. And here is the Cybermen's spaceship, the invasion spaceship, the one that we saw. Right, now if I'm right, I think that this will come to this side of the Moon and boost signals to the Earth.
Precisely.
The micro-monolithic circuits are artificial nervous systems. Once activated they will produce the Cyber-hypnotic force that controls human beings.
Yes, there is a way to block the signals, isn't there, Zoe.
Yes. Have you any neuristors here, Professor?
Zoe, I want you to show the Professor what to do. The invasion could come at any moment.
Brigadier, they must all be fitted once. The invasion could come at any moment.
Good. Good. If you want any help, just call me up.
Now then, now many have you made, Zoe?
What? There must be some more amongst all this gubbins. Come on, let's have a look. We must protect everyone here at least. Now search, everybody. Come along.
Zoe, my depolariser. It must have fallen off!
Yes, Jamie, I rather gathered that. Is everyone else all right?
Oh, what about the Brigadier, and the rest of the men?
Brigadier, what about the rest of the UNIT men?
Oh, thank you.
Jamie?
Yes. We appear to be sitting right in the middle of the hornet's nest.
I agree. The Cybermen will attack in force now. There must be thousands of them in outer space.
Not unless we can stop the Cyber-control signals.
Yes, I'm afraid it does.
How long would all this take?
Oh, I'm surprised they're not here already.
Yes, at least we know where they'll land. They'll home in on Vaughn's radio signal.
Yes, that's a good idea. We might have a try.
Oh, Zoe, sit down. It's a big bumpy. Now, how's Jamie's leg?
Well, he would be, wouldn't he. How's the Professor?
Well I suggest that you go with the Brigadier. Much as I detest computers, I think that remarkable brain of yours will come in very handy.
I think it's about time I had a serious talk with our Mister Vaughn.
No, we need time if we're going to stop this attack, and I think I can get us that time.
You can't afford not to, Brigadier. If you're going to attack the Cybermen with missiles, they're going to retaliate, and we want to know how and with what.
I'll leave my radio on, and then you'll hear every word that passes between me and Vaughn.
Oh, there's one particular place where there'll be no Cybermen.
In the sewers.
Bye bye.
(sotto) UNIT control. This is the Doctor. Is the Brigadier there, please?
Brigadier, I've just entered the sewers. I'm going to make my way to Vaughn's headquarters. I'll give you a call when I get there.
Thank you.
Oh, there you are. Can you hear me, Mister Vaughn?
I hope I haven't called at an inconvenient moment, but I would rather like a word with you.
Oh, it was nothing. I'll come up. I know the way.
Brigadier. Brigadier.
Ah. I'm just about to enter the lion's den. I will leave the radio on as from now.
Thank you.
And you trust them?
Then you must know what ruthless and inhuman killers they are.
Do you really think they'll honour any bargain that you make with them?
What do they get out of all this?
Oh, you're a fool, Vaughn. When they get here, they'll take over.
Oh, possibly. But what about the others, out there in space? Are they conditioned to obey your commands?
With the Professor's machine?
With one machine?
But you'll have to have the Professor's help to do that, won't you? We've got the Professor.
But you can't be sure of that, can you?
But you daren't take the risk! Once the Cybermen take over, they'll destroy the Earth as we know it!
I'm trying to stop you from destroying the human race!
I don't know what you're talking about.
You must stop them! This is madness! You can't trust them!
Is this what you wanted? To be the ruler of a dead world?
Now you're beginning to understand the Cybermen, Vaughn, you can't make bargains with them!
Vaughn! Switch it off, you'll blow us all sky high!
That won't stop them. They're still out there in space preparing to destroy the world.
Vaughn, listen to me. The Cybermen will deliver their bomb on the same radio beam they used for their invasion. You've got to turn it off, man. You've got to turn it off!
We're both on the same side now, both fighting for our lives. You've got to turn the radio beam off!
Yes! That's how they'll deliver their bomb!
Vaughn, where is the transmitter for the radio beam?
Oh, don't be a fool, man. Where do we turn it off?
Right. We must stop them. Brigadier, Brigadier, this is the Doctor. Can you still hear me.
There are only two possibilities. We must either cut off the transmitter of the radio beam at the compound or destroy the Cyberman spaceship.
Oh, I've no idea, it could be minutes or hours. Depends how long it'll takes them to prepare this bomb of theirs.
Then there's only one chance. The radio beam. Wait. Vaughn. Now, Vaughn, will you help us? We must try to get to the controls of the radio beam. We'll never do it in time unless you help us!
Yes, if you'll help us!
Well, to save us. To save yourself!
Oh, for heaven's sake, stop thinking about yourself! Think of the millions of people on earth who are about to die!
Vaughn, will you listen?
Yes, Brigadier?
Yes, yes, we'll wait there for you.
Oh, dear.
Er, Brigadier. We're just coming in to land at the compound.
No, no, I'm sorry, Brigadier. We must go in right away, otherwise we'll be too late.
Don't worry. We have the Professor's machine. It's proved to be very effective so far.
Vaughn says that the transmitter controls are in the old IE factory. That's on the east side of the compound.
We want to get to the radio transmitter control room. The Cybermen don't know we're here yet. Let's keep that element of surprise. Come on, we'll try down here.
Now they know we're here.
Look out!
Look out! Come on!
Is this the only way down?
Come on, then.
There don't seem to be any Cybermen about at all. That's odd.
Look behind you!
What? Yes, yes, it's there, in that building. The radio transmitter control, you've got to destroy it!
Oh, but I
I'm not sure. Possibly to try to avoid the Russian missile or
Yes, I'm afraid so. You see, from where they were, let's say two hundred and thirty thousand miles out in space, their conventional missiles couldn't deliver the bomb, so they had to come in close.
But it's going in the opposite direction!
Yes, Brigadier, I'm afraid it is.
Yes. This is fine, thank you.
Yes, yes. Well I'm very much obliged to you, Captain.
Goodbye to you. Goodbye, Isobel. Goodbye, everyone. Come along, Jamie.
Now, then, where exactly did we leave it? You two try over there.
There we are, all done and ready to go. Bye bye. Bye!

The Tardis, where else?
I'll give you a guided tour someday.
Boot cupboard. Not very interesting.
Oh, I've seen bigger boot cupboards.
Well, how big's big? Relative dimensions, you see. No constant.
How big are you at the moment?
Listen, listen. There are no measurements in infinity. You humans have got such limited little minds. I don't know why I like you so much.
That's true, that's very true.
What?
Yes, yes, it is good. Do you know, this is the second control room. You know, I could run the Tardis just as easily from here as I could from the old one. Come to think of it, this was the old one.
Yes, it is.
Ah ha.
It's the Mandragora Helix. I thought we'd avoided it.
It's a spiral of pure energy that radiates outwards in ways no one understands, though at its centre there's a controlling intelligence.
Yes.
Yes, it does seem more active than usual. Let's hope we can counter-magnetise enough to resist the pull.
It's living, all right, but that's all anyone
We'll just have to push on and hope we come out the other side.
Concentrate, Sarah.
Anything, anything. Say the alphabet backwards. Come on. Z, Y, X
C, B, A. It's all over, it's all over. Any ill effects?
Where?
I don't know. The Astrosextant rectifier has gone out of phase. I'll just go out and have a look. Not you, me. You stay there.
Hmm. Bigger than my boot cupboard.
Yes. I thought I told you to stay inside.
What noise?
Come on, quick! Get down.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Helix energy. It could have been very nasty.
Will you stop whittering.
Strange. Forced landing.
Not that time. I didn't touch a thing. Promise.
Maybe that's why I stopped using the old control room.
Helix forcefields must have distorted the coordinates.
We've landed on Earth. Glass technology indicates Mediterranean area. Late fifteenth century. Not a very pleasant time. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah?
Stop.
Now put the girl down. Gently.
Mandragora energy. And I brought it here. It got into the Tardis.
Excuse me. I'm a traveller around here. I'm a stranger in these parts, and I was wondering if you'd seen a girl. She'd be about
She's a friend of mine. She'd be about five foot four and a half.
I'm a traveller.
Have you seen a young girl, about five foot
Probably with orange juice on her chin.
Oh, just a short gallop. It's good for the liver.
Huh? Er, Doctor.
Around. Around.
Please don't threaten me, Count. I've come here to help you.
A wave of energy has been released, Count. It's part of the Mandragora Helix. It could do untold damage. And I must take it back to the stars.
Please. Please. Please. Please listen. Listen, please. I realise that must sound very strange to you. Let me put it this way. A ball of heavenly fire has come down to Earth. It could consume everything in its path. It could destroy the world.
Ask your seer Hieronymous if he's ever seen an energy wave.
Sometimes.
No.
Because you don't have a future unless you listen to me.
This is all a great waste of time.
Well, it depends, doesn't it.
On whether the Moon is made of cheese, on whether the cock crows three times before dawn, and twelve hens lay addled eggs.
I can easily teach him. All it requires is a colourful imagination and a glib tongue.
But you haven't listened to a word I've said!
Excuse me, excuse me. I like to look my best on these occasions.
The Mandragora Helix has come home to roost.
Stay there a minute.
Some soldiers up there. No. We'll just have to wait till they've gone.
Yes, I know. Particularly nasty Roman sect, supposed to have died out in the third century.
We are, and the cult of Demnos is still very much alive.
Sub-thermal recombination of ionised plasma.
When we landed on Earth, we brought back with us part of the Mandragora Helix. I don't know how it got in the Tardis, and now it's here in this temple.
Coincidence? I wonder what the Mandragora Helix is up to?
No. Helix intelligences don't have a physical existence in the way you know it. They don't need Earth. They want
(sotto) There's something behind us. I can feel it in my bones.
Stop poking me with that pike!
Apologies?
Who's your uncle?
Oh, yes, yes, we've met.
Tell me more about this Federico.
Are you sure of that?
I take it you don't get on with your uncle.
This is intensely interesting. I don't think that Sarah and I are going to be able to help you. You see, we're just passing through. How did you know my name?
Oh, I do dabble a bit.
You're too kind. But that isn't the only reason you brought us here.
Show us.
Helix energy. High ionisation that has only to touch human tissue to destroy it utterly.
No, of course not. Nevertheless
Something's certainly entered the city, Giuliano. Some malevolent power quite beyond the understanding of that old fraud Hieronymous. The question is, why?
Why here? Why now?
We seem to have an awful lot of questions. It's about time we started finding some answers.
Giuliano, it isn't easy to explain the concept of Helix energy, either sub or super-thermal ionisation in your mediaeval vocabulary.
Thank you.
Well, perhaps because the worshippers of Demnos provided a ready-made power base. And what better place than fifteenth century Italy?
Because it's the period between the dark ages of superstition and the dawn of a new reason.
Yes. Oh, yes. Giuliano, that temple must be destroyed.
Those ruins are the focal point for enormous forces. The Helix energy has penetrated every stone. Is there some way I could get there without being seen?
Just tell me. It's better if I go alone.
Just as far as the temple entrance. No further.
From this point on, I must go on alone. You stay here.
You can't count, Count.
That was lucky. The Brethren ran right past. Where's Sarah?
What? You mean she's wandering around in these catacombs? Let's have a look at this shoulder.
This should staunch the blood. You know, the finest swordsman I ever saw was a captain in Cleopatra's bodyguard. He showed me a few points. That's it. I don't know that Florence Nightingale would approve this little lash-up.
Oh, yes. Helix energy is still there, all right. Played some very nasty tricks.
All right?
Good. Let's go and see what happened to Sarah.
What?
Giuliano, you're not afraid, are you?
That's funny. Most people would be. Come on.
This way.
The ancients who built this place knew a thing or two. Come on.
Sarah! Oh, Sarah.
I think so.
What happened?
I don't know. Perhaps they're planning to come back for her. You know, this leads under the palace.
Well, the first time I saw the leader of the cult, he was walking this way. He probably comes this way regularly. You know something? I don't think the Mandragora intelligence hijacked the Tardis and brought us here by accident. There must already be someone here who's sympathetic to its influence. Possibly there's been some tenuous influence for centuries.
What?
Salvatore ambulando.
Don't you worry about it. I'll explain it later. Come on.
Anywhere we know?
Oh, excellent.
Let's go.
I'd say you've had visitors.
There's nothing you can do on your own, Giuliano.
Listen, listen. Listen, there are other considerations besides your uncle and his petty ambitions.
Who's coming?
Is Leonardo da Vinci coming?
If anything should happen to those men, they'd be thrown back into a new dark age.
You two stay here.
I have an idea who the leader of the Brethren is.
Don't worry about me. I'm not likely to miss Leonardo da Vinci.
Good evening.
It's time you and I had a little talk, Hieronymous.
Not sure of yourself? Influence comes and goes? I suppose that must be very worrying.
Oh, you could say that, yes.
Fascinating. Predeluvian sandstone with a complex circuit of base metal fused into it.
Hello, Sarah. Poisoned needle? Drop it.
Oh, you don't want to hurt me, Sarah. I'm your friend, remember? Your best friend. Drop it.
You're getting a bit old for this, Hieronymous.
Drug induced hypnosis. Hieronymous is an old slyboots.
You only did what you were ordered. What I expected.
Well, I've taken you to some strange places before and you've never asked how you understood the local language. It's a Time Lord's gift I allow you to share. But tonight when you asked me how you understood Italian, I realised your mind had been taken over.
See to Marco.
Count Federico, can't you understand? I'm not interested in your political ambitions. Your enemies are not here in this dungeon. They're in the temple. It isn't Giuliano you have to fear, it's Hieronymous.
That fake is the leader of the Brethren.
Yes. And he's possessed of extraordinary powers. Helix energy.
You don't. But if Hieronymous isn't stopped, I promise you, there'll be no dukedom for you or anyone else to rule over after tonight.
Whatever you do, Count, don't go near him.
No priest available. Will a Brother do?
Your Count is dead.
Yes, in the temple ruins.
Let's say Hieronymous gave him a blank look.
Rossini, you don't have any authority to give orders any more. Giuliano is the lawful ruler.
Wrong, Marco, wrong. The evil's only just beginning. Hieronymous and the Brethren remain
Shush, Marco, Marco. Giuliano, if you go near that temple, you go to your death.
The Brothers are still absorbing power. Gather together all the men you can, carpenters, stonemasons, soldiers, and block every entrance to the palace. Turn it into a fortress. Because when the Brethren attack, you're going to need one.
Anything to give us time. I need time to think. Anyway, his power isn't complete yet.
Well, so far
The only helix energy is what we brought with us.
Yes, tomorrow night, when Mandragora swallows the Moon.
I'm just telling you what he told me.
Hieronymous. (sotto) When Mandragora swallows the Moon, that's when they'll strike.
Yes, just about adequate. Pity, another fifty years we could have used Galileo's.
Astrolabe, Sarah.
Astrolabe.
Medieval sextant. Come on.
I'm trying to make this thing work exactly. Roughly won't do at all. Unfortunately, the alidade's almost a whole degree out. Compensate for error and convert to the Copernican system.
Seventeen from sixty.
I've got it.
Forty three minutes and eight seconds past nine.
Mandragora swallows the Moon. In other words, a lunar eclipse.
Yes. More important, it's when all this could become man's only science.
Nonsense? It isn't nonsense, miss. Just you remember what Hieronymous did to you. Mandragora doesn't conquer in the physical sense. It dominates and controls by Helix energy, astral force. It takes away from man the only thing worth having.
Well, a sense of purpose, what else? The ability granted to every intelligent species to shape its own destiny. Once let Mandragora gain control, and man's ambition wouldn't stretch beyond the next meal. It'll turn you into sheep. Idle, mindless, useless sheep.
All or nothing. I'll have to risk it.
Hello, it's nice to see you. Listen, if it's ionised plasma, it's molecular and by now must be spread pretty thinly among Hieronymous and the Brethren. Exhaust it. Exhaust it, that's the answer.
Could you get me one of these and a length of wire?
Yes, wire. It must be at least a hundred and fifty years since wire-drawing machines were invented. There must be some about the place?
Good idea, I'll do that. What was your question?
You're going to hold a dance?
Dangerous? My dear Duke, you've got lots of guests to entertain. Of course you must hold a hop. Sarah will love it. Ask her.
And Giuliano, save me a costume. I love a knees-up.
Good. Now the coat. I don't want this to show. Thank you.
How do I look?
A little plan. Leave the wire.
That looks as if it would be very becoming, eh?
Remember the French at Agincourt.
I think I'll settle for the lion.
Yes.
Desperately bad, but we can only do our best and hope. You coming?
Marco, is Leonardo among that lot?
I don't think I'm ever going to meet Leonardo. Will you open up the dungeon entrance, please?
Thank you. Sarah? I want you to stay here and keep an eye on this lot.
A Time Lord has to do what a Time Lord has to do. Besides, you're not equipped.
Did I? Oh, yes.
Well, only if I guess wrong, and then it's fatal.
All right, listen. Negatively charged high energy particles follow magnetic lines of force, yes?
Therefore, if I've guessed correctly about the nature of Helix energy, I should be able to drain it off.
When did I ever guess wrong about anything?
Hello, there. Had a hard day in the catacombs, have you?
Oh, come off it, Hieronymous. You know who I am. You can drop all that bosh about sacred stones and profanity. Just be your natural horrid self.
Would you believe it? I had no choice.
Well, you see, that's a great pity because I can't allow you to interfere with Earth's progress.
It's part of a Time Lord's job to insist on justice for all species.
Time Lords don't die that easily, Hieronymous.
Come on, Hieronymous. You can do better than that. Come on, Heironymous.
Come on.
Well, I thought that was rather clever. (Hieronymous) A case of energy squared. It puts Mandragora back to square one. (normal) Well, don't just stand there, I'm in the market for congratulations. (Hieronymous) I wouldn't even say no to a salami sandwich.
Goodbye, Giuliano.
This is lovely salami. Thank you.
I'm already committed, sorry.
It'll all come in time. Keep an open mind. That's the secret.
Come on, Sarah.
Leonardo? Leonardo who?
Oh, that Leonardo. No, I didn't get to see him. Good thing, too.
Well, his submarine design wasn't exactly practical, you know.
Yes.
No, he won't, but the Earth will. Their constellation will be in position to try again in about five hundred years.
That's right. Now that was an interesting century.
Come on.

Rory!
I've crushed your flowers.
Where is she?
Whenever you're ready, Amy.
Oh, way-hey! You've swallowed a planet.
You're huge.
Look at you. When worlds collide.
Oh, look at you both. Five years later and you haven't changed a bit, apart from age and size.
Are you pregnant?
Ah, Leadworth. Vibrant as ever.
Where is everyone?
Well, don't let that get you down.
Well, I wanted to see how you were. You know me, I don't just abandon people when they leave the Tardis. This Time Lord's for life. You don't get rid of your old pal the Doctor so easily.
Yeah, bit of a mistake. But look, what a result. Look at this bench. What a nice bench. What will they think of next? So. What do you do around here to stave off the, you know
Self harm.
(silent) Relax.
Oh blimey, my head's a bit. Ooo. Er, no, you're right, there wasn't a lot of time for birdsong back in the good old
Days. What? No, yes, sorry, what? Oh, you're okay. Oh, thank God. I had a terrible nightmare about you two. That was scary. Don't ask. You don't want to know. You're safe now.
That's what counts. Blimey. Never dropped off like that before. Well, never, really. I'm getting on a bit, you see. Don't let the cool gear fool you. Now, what's wrong with the console? Red flashing lights. I bet they mean something.
It was a bit similar, in some aspects.
Well, all of them.
Basically.
Did I say nightmare? No, more of a really good mare. Look, it doesn't matter. We all had some kind of psychic episode. We probably jumped a time track or something. Forget it. We're back to reality now.
Listen to me. Trust nothing. From now on, trust nothing you see, hear or feel.
Yeah. You thought you were awake on the Tardis, too.
Yeah, you're home. You're also dreaming. Trouble is, Rory, Amy, which is which? Are we flashing forwards or backwards? Hold on tight. This is going be a tricky one.
Oh, this is bad. I don't like this.
Argh. Never use force. You just embarrass yourself. Unless you're cross, in which case, always use force.
I threw it in a supernova.
Because I disagreed with it. Stop talking to me when I'm cross.
If we were dreaming of the future.
Yeah, and we could still be in Upper Leadworth, dreaming of this. Don't you get it?
And you thought you were definitely awake when you were all elephanty.
And you could be giving birth right now. This could be the dream. I told you. Trust nothing we see or hear or feel. Look around you. Examine everything. Look for all the details that don't ring true.
Valid point.
It's dead. We're in a dead time machine.
Remember, this is real. But when we wake up in the other place, remember how real this feels.
It felt solid in the Tardis too. You can't spot a dream while you're having it.
Looking for motion blur, pixilation. It could be a computer simulation. I don't think so, though.
Hello. You're a doctor.
A doctor, not a nurse. Just like you've always dreamed. How interesting.
Your dream wife, your dream job, probably your dream baby. Maybe this is your dream.
What's that?
You said everyone here lives to their nineties. There's something here that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick.
Oh, easy, D-96 compound, plus. No, you don't have that yet. Forget that.
Slightly keen to move on. Freak psychic schism to sort out. You're incredibly old, aren't you?
The heating's off.
Yeah. Put on a jumper. That's what I always do.
I wouldn't believe her nice old lady act if I were you.
Everything's off. Sensors, core power. We're drifting. The scanner's down so we can't even see out. We could be anywhere. Someone, something, is overriding my controls.
How did you get into my Tardis? What are you?
Nice look.
I'll do the talking, thank you. Amy, want to take a guess at what that is?
Dreams, delusions, cheap tricks.
Where did you pick up this cheap cabaret act?
Am I?
I don't know. It's a big universe.
Maybe because he has no physical form. That gets you down after a while, so he's taking it out on folk like us who can touch and eat and feel.
They've all gone. They've all gone.
One of my tawdry quirks. Sniffing out things that aren't what they seem. So, come on, let's think. The mechanics of this reality split we're stuck in. Time asleep exactly matches time in our dream world, unlike in conventional dreams.
Yes, sort of communal trance. Very rare, very complicated. I'm sure there's a dream giveaway, a tell, but my mind isn't working because this village is so dull! I'm slowing down, like you two have.
Okay, you're a doctor, help her.
It's okay, we're doctors.
What?
Sorry.
Now, we all know there's an elephant in the room.
No, no. The hormones seem real, but no. Is nobody going to mention Rory's ponytail? You hold him down, I'll cut it off?
Bow ties are cool. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't hire Mrs Poggit as a babysitter. What's she doing? What does she want?
What does it matter if we're cold? We have to know what she is up to. Sorry, sorry. There should be some stuff down there. Have a look.
Ah, Rory, wind. Amy, could you attach this to the monitor, please.
It's a generator. Get winding.
Rory, wind.
We're in trouble.
A star. A cold star.
That's why we're freezing. It's not a heating malfunction. We're drifting towards a cold sun. There's our deadly danger for this version of reality.
So's this one. It's just burning cold.
I can't know everything. Why does everybody expect me to, always?
I don't know, but there it is, and I'd say we've got about fourteen minutes until we crash into it. But that's not a problem.
Because we'll have frozen to death by then.
Stay calm. Don't get sucked in to it, because this just might be the battle that we have to lose.
What?
Where have the children gone?
Play time's definitely over.
I think they did.
No, they're very old people. Sorry, Rory, I don't think you're what's been keeping them alive.
Leave her alone.
Drop it. Drop all of it. I know who you are.
Course I do. No idea how you can be here, but there's only one person in the universe who hates me as much as you do.
Hello, we were wondering where you went. To get reinforcements, by the look of it. Are you all right? You look a bit tense.
Rory.
I suspect he's not himself. Don't get comfortable here. You may have to run, fast.
There's a whole creature inside her. Inside all of them. They've been there for years, living and waiting.
Run. Okay, leave them, leave them. Talk to me. Talk to me. You are Eknodines. A proud, ancient race. you're better than this.
Why are you hiding away here? Why aren't you at home?
Planet by upstart neighbours.
Been living here inside the bodies of old humans for years. No wonder they live so long. You're keeping them alive.
Okay. Makes sense, I suppose. Credible enough. Could be real.
You need to leave this planet.
Oh, pipe down. I'm busy.
Wait, wait, stop.
The three of us have to agree, now, which is the dream.
No, no, no. Ice can burn. Sofas can read. It's a big universe. We have to agree which battle to lose. All of us, now.
This one.
Yeah, but are we disagreeing or competing?
Nine minutes till impact.
Outside? Brrr. How many noughts have you got? Inside? I don't know but I can't feel my feet and other parts.
Stop competing.
Yeah, because the universe is really small and there's bound to be someone nearby.
No, we're not, but our time's running out. If we fall asleep here we're in trouble. If we could divide up, then we'd have an active presence in each world, but the Dream Lord is switching us between the worlds. Why? Why? what's the logic?
Amy, don't be scared. We'll be back.
Okay, where is it?
Oh, you couldn't live near the shops, could you.
It's okay, it's only me.
Come on, jump in. Quickly, get in now. Quickly. Hurry up. Are we in?
Come on, let's go.
All four, quick.
Everyone in.
Everybody, out, out, out. Into the church, that's right. Don't answer the door.
Fine. I need to find my friends.
Okay.
Sorry. I had to stop off at the butcher's.
I don't know. I thought the freezing Tardis was real but now I'm not so sure.
They're scared. Fear generates savagery.
Not always. I'm sorry.
Unless we just die.
How do you know?
Either because this is just a dream or because they know what we're about to do.
Be very sure. This could be the real world.
Okay. Okay.
Me, I'm going to blow up the Tardis.
Notice how helpful the Dream Lord was? Okay, there was misinformation, red herrings, malice, and I could have done without the limerick. But he was always very keen to make us choose between dream and reality.
Yes, it is.
Star burning cold? Do me a favour. The Dream Lord has no power over the real world. He was offering us a choice between two dreams.
Because I know who he is.
Any questions?
A speck of psychic pollen from the candle meadows of Karass don Slava. Must have been hanging around for ages. Fell in the time rotor, heated up and induced a dream state for all of us.
No, no. No. Sorry, wasn't it obvious? The Dream Lord was me. Psychic pollen. It's a mind parasite. It feeds on everything dark in you, gives it a voice, turns it against you. I'm nine hundred and seven. It had a lot to go on.
The darkness in you pair, it would've starved to death in an instant. I choose my friends with great care. Otherwise, I'm stuck with my own company, and you know how that works out.
Amy, right now a question is about to occur to Rory. And seeing as the answer is about to change his life, I think you should give him your full attention.
There it is.
So, well then, where now? Or should I just pop down to the swimming pool for a few lengths?

No, Amy, it's definitely not the fifth moon of Cindie Colesta. I think I can see a Ryman's.
Amy! Amy!
Amy! Amy.
Well, that's good, because I'm your new lodger. Do you know, this is going to be easier than I expected.
Well, aren't you lucky I came along? More lucky than you know. Less of a young professional, more of an ancient amateur, but frankly I'm an absolute dream.
Yes, quite right. Have some rent.
That's probably quite a lot, isn't it? Looks like a lot. Is it a lot? I can never tell.
Don't spend it all on sweets, unless you like sweets. I like sweets. Ooo.
That's how we greet each other nowadays, isn't it? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor, too. Still don't know why.
Yep. Who lives upstairs?
What's he look like?
Ah. I suppose that's dry rot?
Or none of the above.
No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor, don't call me the Rotmeister. This is the most beautiful parlour I have ever seen. You're obviously a man of impeccable taste. I can stay, Craig, can't I? Say I can.
The room?
My room? Oh, yes. My room. My room. Take me to my room.
How very convenient. This'll do just right. In fact.
No time to lose. I'll take it. Ah you'll want to see my credentials. There.
National Insurance number. NHS number. References.
I'm his special favourite. Are you hungry? I'm hungry.
You've got everything I need for an omelette fines herbes, pour deux. So, who's the girl on the fridge?
Girlfriend?
Oh, that's completely normal. Works for me.
Oh really, a communications exchange? That could be handy.
Well, I've got one of those faces. People never stop blurting out their plans while I'm around.
Oh, don't worry, it'll materialise. If all goes to plan.
Paris, in the eighteenth century. No, hang on, that's not recent, is it? Seventeenth? No, no, no. Twentieth. Sorry, I'm not used to doing them in the right order.
They never really stop. Ever been to Paris, Craig?
I can tell from your sofa.
You're starting to look like it.
Those keys.
You're sort of fondling them.
Right.
I can stay?
My door. My place. My gaff. Ha ha! Yes. Me with a key.
Why would I want that?
Earth to Pond, Earth to Pond.
Come in, Pond.
Could you not wreck my new earpiece, Pond?
How's the Tardis coping?
Ooo, nasty. She's locked in a materialisation loop, trying to land again
But she can't.
I don't know what it is yet. Anything that can stop the Tardis from landing is big. Scary big.
Be fair. Could be even
Orange juice. Neocene Arbuckle. Rare tarantula on the table. Oh.
I can't go up there until I know what it is and how to deal with it. And it is vital that this man upstairs doesn't realise who and what I am. So no sonicking. No advanced technology. I can only use this because we're on scramble. To anyone else hearing this conversation, we're talking absolute gibberish.
Practical eruption in chicken. Descartes Lombardy spiral.
Now all I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
So you're just going to be snide. No helpful hints?
Bow ties are cool. Come on, Amy, I'm a normal bloke. Tell me what normal blokes do.
I could do those things. I don't, but I could.
Hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Amy?
Interesting. Localised time loop.
Time distortion. Whatever's happening upstairs is still affecting you.
My end's good.
No, no, no, not really. Just keep the zigzag plotter on full.
That'll protect you.
Amy, I said the zigzag plotter.
What, you're standing with the door behind you?
Okay, take two steps to your right and pull it again.
Now, I must not use the sonic. I've got work to do.
Need to pick up a few items.
Shush. Don't get comfortable.
Ta ra ra boom de ay quanda rilo, something is happening.)
Hello?
Oh, sorry. I like a good soak.
What did you say?
Sorry?
What did you say?
Craig?
Ow.
No choice. It's sonicking time.
What happened, what's going on?
Correct. You spoke to the man upstairs?
What did he look like?
I thought you might be in trouble.
Ah! Hello. The Doctor.
You must be Sophie.
Pub league. A drinking competition?
Football. Football. Yes, blokes play football. I'm good at football, I think.
Do you play, Sophie?
Better get dressed.
Bit of a mess.
You've got two sets of keys to someone else's house?
I see. You must like it here too.
So, I'm going out. If I hang about the house all the time, him upstairs might get suspicious and notice me.
Yeah, football. All outdoorsy.
Now, football's the one with the sticks, isn't it?
Just call me the Doctor.
Why not?
Hello, I'm Craig's new flat mate. I'm called the Doctor.
Arms.
Not sure. The front? The side? Below.
Let's find out.
Oh yes, I love this game.
Annihilate? No. No violence, do you understand me? Not while I'm around. Not today, not ever. I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm, and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
Lovely. What sort of time?
Amy?
Amy?
What does the scanner say?
Yes, yes, it's, it's good. Zigzag plotter. Zigzag plotter, Amy.
Amy? Are you there?
Amy?
Oh, thank heavens. I thought for a moment the Tardis had been flung off into the vortex
With you inside it, lost forever.
How are the numbers?
Fives? Even better.
Still, it means the effect's almost unbelievably powerful and dangerous, but don't worry.
Hang on, okay?
I've got some rewiring to do.
Hello, flat mate.
Oh, don't mind me. You won't even know I'm here.
That's the idea.
Yes, perfect! What a beauty.
Hello.
Whoops. Sorry. Don't worry, I wasn't listening. In a world of my own down there.
Just re-connecting all the electrics. It's a real mess. Where's the on switch for this?
What? Do I have to stay now?
I don't mind.
Six billion people. Watching you two at work, I'm starting to wonder where they all come from.
So then, the call centre. That's no good, then. What do you really want to do?
What's stopping you?
Well, perhaps that's you, then. Perhaps you'll just have to stay here, secure and a little bit miserable, till the day you drop. Better than trying and failing, eh?
Everybody's got dreams, Sophie. Very few are going to achieve them, so why pretend?
Perhaps, in the whole wide universe, a call centre about is where you should be.
Is it true?
It's a big old world, Sophie. Work out what's really keeping you here, eh?
Right. Shield's up. Let's scan.
Upstairs.
No traces of high technology. Totally
Normal? No, no, no, no, no, it can't be. It's too normal.
Without knowing and get myself killed? Then you really are lost. If I could just get a look in there. Hold on. Use the data bank. Get me the plans of this building. I want to know its history, the layout, everything.
]Meanwhile, I shall recruit a spy.
Craig? Craig? Breakfast. It's normal. Craig?
Craig. Craig, Craig, Craig. I told you not to touch it. Look, what's that?
It's an unfamiliar and obviously poisonous substance. Oh, I know what'd be really clever, I'll stick my hand in it. Come on, Craig, breathe.
Come on, Craig, breathe. Thems are healthy footballer's lungs.
Right, reverse the enzyme decay. Excite the tannin molecules.
On no account. You need rest. One more.
You're important. You're going to be fine, Craig.
I think that's not what my screen is telling me, Mister Lang.
If that's your attitude, Mister Lang, please take your custom elsewhere.
Hello, Craig. How are you feeling? Had some time to kill. I was curious. Never worked in an office. Never worked in anywhere.
Yes. I was your representative. We don't need Mister Lang any more. Rude Mister Lang.
Sophie, my hero.
You look awful. About turn. Bed. Now. Who next? Oh, yes. Hello, Mister Joergensen. Can you hold? I have to eat a biscuit.
Have you been upstairs? Yes?
You can do it. Show me what's up there? What's behind that door? Try to show me. Oh, but that doesn't make sense. Ever see anyone go up there? Lots of people? Good, good. What kind of people?
People who never came back down. Oh, that's bad. That's very bad.
Oh, hello.
What have I done?
Lots of people talk to cats.
It's art. A statement on modern society, Ooo, ain't modern society awful.
Your days will get a lot weirder if I go.
Craig, I can't leave this place. I'm like you, I can't see the point of anywhere else. Madrid? Ha, what a dump. I have to stay.
I can't go.
Right. Only way. I'm going to show you something, but shush. Really, shush. Oh, I am going to regret this. Okay, right. First, general background.
Ow.
Yes.
Shush.
Yes. Shush. Eleventh. Right. Okay, specific detail.
Amy! Amy!
Yes, with this right above it. Which is odd, because Amy hasn't written it yet.
Time travel. It can happen.
Shut up!
I am never, never doing that ever, ever again.
Amy.
Oh, of course, you can understand us now. Hurrah. Got those plans yet?
I've worked it out, with psychic help from a cat.
Yes. I know he's got a time engine in the flat upstairs.
He's using innocent people to try and launch it.
Whenever he does, they get burnt up, hence the stain on your ceiling.
Well done, Craig.
And you, Miss Pond, nearly get thrown off into the Vortex.
Amy.
Someone's up there.
Hang on. Craig, come on. Someone's dying up there.
DOCTOR; Wait, wait.
Amy?
Just going in.
Of course I can be upstairs.
Oh. Oh, of course. The time engine isn't in the flat, the time engine is the flat. Someone's attempt to build a Tardis.
Has there? Think about it.
Perception filter. It's more than a disguise. It tricks your memory.
It's controlling her. It's willing her to touch the activator.
Ah, deadlock seal.
What? Why's it let her go? So, okay.
Right. Stop. Crashed ship, let's see. Hello, I'm Captain Troy Handsome of International Rescue. Please state the nature of your emergency.
You're the emergency crash program. A hologram. What, you've been luring people up here so you can try them out?
Hush. Human brains aren't strong enough, they just burn. But you're stupid, though. You just keep trying.
Oh, for goodness sake. The top floor of Craig's building is in reality an alien space ship intent on slaughtering the population of this planet. Any questions? No, good.
Yes, I was a bit worried that you were going to say that.
It's pulling me in. I'm the new pilot.
No, I'm way too much for this ship. My hand touches that panel, the planet doesn't blow up, the whole solar system does.
No. Worst choice ever, I promise you. Stop this.
It doesn't want everyone. Craig, it didn't want you.
It didn't want Sophie before but now it does. What's changed? Argh. No. No, I gave her the idea of leaving. It's a machine that needs to leave. It wants people who want to escape. And you don't want to leave, Craig. You're Mister Sofa Man.
Craig, you can shut down the engine. Put your hand on the panel and concentrate on why you want to stay.
Yes.
Yes.
Of course it's a lie.
Craig, what's keeping you here? Think about everything that makes you want to stay here. Why don't you want to leave?
Oh, not now, not again. Craig, the planet's about to burn. For God's sake, kiss the girl.
Big no.
Emergency shutdown. It's imploding. Everybody out, out, out!
Perception filter. There never was a top floor.
Yes, well, you were sort of busy.
Thank you. Because I might pop back soon, have another little stay.
Thank you, Craig.
Sophie. Now then. Six billion four hundred thousand and twenty six people in the world. That's the number to beat.
Back in time. You need to go to the paper shop and leave that note for me.
Oh, rectifier's playing up again Hold on. You write the note and I'll change that will.
Make sure it's a red pen.

Oh. Hello. Sorry to burst in on you like this. Okay if we stop here for a bit?
Books. People never really stop loving books.
Fifty first century. By now you've got holovids, direct to brain downloads, fiction mist, but you need the smell. The smell of books, Donna. Deep breath.
The Library. So big it doesn't need a name. Just a great big The.
It's a world. Literally, a world. The whole core of the planet is the index computer. Biggest hard drive ever. And up here, every book ever written. Whole continents of Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones, Monty Python's Big Red Book. Brand new editions, specially printed.
We're near the equator, so this must be biographies. I love biographies.
You need a good death. Without death, there'd only be comedies. Dying gives us size.
Way-a. Spoilers.
These books are from your future. You don't want to read ahead. Spoil all the surprises. Like peeking at the end.
I try to keep you away from major plot developments. Which, to be honest, I seem to be very bad at, because you know what? This is the biggest library in the universe. So where is everyone? It's silent.
The planet. The whole planet.
No, I never land on Sundays. Sundays are boring.
Yeah, maybe. But they'd still show up on the system.
Oh, you know, just passing.
Now that's interesting.
Scanning for life forms. If I do a scan looking for your basic humanoids. You know, your book readers, few limbs and a face, apart from us, I get nothing. Zippo, nada. See? Nobody home. But if I widen the parameters to any kind of life.
A million, million. Gives up after that. A million, million.
And not a sound. A million. million life forms, and silence in the library.
Yeah.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
No, but really, it's fine.
So that's why we're here. Any other messages, same date stamp?
Yeah, yeah, fine, fine, fine. Just play it.
Donna?
Stay out of the shadows.
Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit. I got a message on the psychic paper.
What do you think? Cry for help?
Oh, we've all done that.
No idea.
Donna.
Run!
Come on.
Jammed. The wood's warped.
I can't, it's wood.
Hang on, hang on. I can vibrate the molecules, fry the bindings. I can shatterline the interface.
Oh. Hello. Sorry to burst on you like this. Okay if we stop here for a bit?
Security camera. Switched itself off.
Nice door skills, Donna.
Possibly.
Of course we're safe. There's a little shop.
Gotcha!
Ooo, I'm sorry. I really am. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's alive.
It is. It's an alive one.
That's barely more than a speak your weight machine, it can't help you.
It's the fifty first century. That's basically like donating a park bench.
No, wait, no.
The shadow. Look.
Count the shadows.
Yeah But what's casting it?
Oh, I'm thick! Look at me, I'm old and thick. Head's too full of stuff. I need a bigger head.
This place runs on fission cells. They'll outburn the sun.
It's not dark.
We need to get back to the Tardis.
Because that shadow hasn't gone. It's moved.
Get out.
All of you. Turn around, get back in your rocket and fly away. Tell your grandchildren you came to the library and lived. They won't believe you.
Please, just leave. I'm asking you seriously and properly, just leave. Hang on. Did you say expedition?
Oh, you're not, are you? Tell me you're not archaeologists.
I'm a time traveller. I point and laugh at archaeologists.
River Song, lovely name. As you're leaving, and you're leaving now, you need to set up a quarantine beacon. Code wall the planet, the whole planet. Nobody comes here, not ever again. Not one living thing, not here, not ever. Stop right there. What's your name?
Anita, stay out of the shadows. Not a foot, not a finger in the shadows till you're safely back in your ship. Goes for all of you. Stay in the light. Find a nice, bright spot and just stand. If you understand me, look very, very scared. No, bit more scared than that. Okay, do for now. You. Who are you?
Okay, Dave.
Other Dave, the way you came, does it look the same as before?
How much darker?
Seal up this door. We'll find another way out.
Right, give it here.
Something came to this library and killed everything in it. Killed a whole world. Danger? Could be.
Bet your life?
Torch.
Spooky, isn't it?
Almost every species in the universe has an irrational fear of the dark. But they're wrong, because it's not irrational. It's Vashta Nerada.
It's what's in the dark. It's what's always in the dark. Lights! That's what we need, lights. You got lights?
Form a circle. Safe area. Big as you can, lights pointing out.
Probably I can help you.
Oh, I'm pretty boy?
Pretty?
Don't let your shadows cross. Seriously, don't even let them touch. Any of them could be infected.
For what?
Oh, that was you?
A fairly good one, actually.
I'm really not, you know.
You've seen me before, then?
Who are you?
It is. It's a phone.
Let me try something.
Okay, doesn't like that. Let's try something else.
Okay, here it comes.
Hello?
Well, no, I'm, I'm sort of in space. Er, I was trying to call up the data core of a triple grid security processor.
Dad or your Mum. That'd be lovely.
Your library?
Er, well, I just rerouted the interface.
I need another terminal. Keep working on those lights. We need those lights!
What rules?
What's that? I didn't do that. Did you do that?
What's Cal?
But who is the little girl? What's she got to do with this place? How does the data core work? What's the principle? What's Cal?
Cal, what is it?
Mister Lux. Right now, you're in more danger than you've ever been in your whole life. And you're protecting a patent?
Well, funny thing, Mister Lux. I don't want to see everyone in this room dead because some idiot thinks his pride is more important.
Okay, okay, okay. Let's start at the beginning. What happened here? On the actual day, a hundred years ago, what physically happened?
Four thousand and twenty two saved. No survivors.
Everybody, careful. Stay in the light.
Who screamed?
Where is she?
It took a lot less than a few seconds.
There's a neural relay in the communicator. Lets you send thought mail. That's it there. Those green lights. Sometimes it can hold an impression of a living consciousness for a short time after death. Like an afterimage.
She's a footprint on the beach. And the tide's coming in.
Help her.
Yeah. Help her.
I'll introduce you.
I'm going to need a packed lunch.
What's in that book?
Who are you?
To me. Who are you to me?
Right, you lot. Let's all meet the Vashta Nerada.
Proper Dave, could you move over a bit?
Over there by the water cooler. Thanks.
Donna! Quiet, I'm working.
Okay, got a live one. That's not darkness down those tunnels. This is not a shadow. It's a swarm. A man eating swarm.
The piranhas of the air. The Vashta Nerada. Literally, the shadows that melt the flesh. Most planets have them, but usually in small clusters. I've never seen an infestation on this scale, or this aggressive.
Mmm. Earth, and a billion other worlds. Where there's meat, there's Vashta Nerada. You can see them sometimes, if you look. The dust in sunbeams.
Nah. Normally they live on road kill. But sometimes people go missing. Not everyone comes back out of the dark.
No. But any shadow.
Daleks, aim for the eyestalk. Sontarans, back of the neck. Vashta Nerada? Run. Just run.
This is an index point. There must be an exit teleport somewhere.
You're right. Brilliant! That's why I like the little shop.
Actually, Proper Dave? Could you stay where you are for a moment?
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. But you've got two shadows.
It's how they hunt. They latch on to a food source and keep it fresh.
You stay absolutely still, like there's a wasp in the room. Like there's a million wasps.
Course we're not leaving him. Where's your helmet? Don't point, just tell me.
Don't cross his shadow. Thanks. Now, the rest of you, helmets back on and sealed up. We'll need everything we've got.
Yeah, but we're safe anyway.
We're not. That was a clever lie to shut you up. Professor, anything I can do with the suit?
Okay.
Eight hundred percent. Pass it on.
What's that?
It's sonic.
With me. Come on.
No talking, just moving. Try it. Right, stand there in the middle. It's a teleport. Stand in the middle. Can't send the others, Tardis won't recognise them.
You don't have a suit. You're not safe.
Donna, let me explain.
Oh, that's how you do it.
Where did it go?
Did you feel anything, like an energy transfer? Anything at all?
Stop there. Stop, stop, stop there. Stop moving. They're never just gone and they never give up.
Well, this one's benign.
No one, they're fine.
Dave, turn around.
Dave, I want you stay still. Absolutely still.
Dave? Dave? Dave, can you hear me? Are you all right? Talk to me, Dave.
I want you to stay still. Absolutely still.
Dave, can you hear me?
Back from it! Get back. Right back.
It's a swarm in a suit. But it's learning.
Squareness gun!
But any shadow.
Trying to boost the power. Light doesn't stop them, but it slows them down.
Your screwdriver looks exactly like mine.
I don't give my screwdriver to anyone.
Who are you?
I teleported Donna back to the Tardis. If we don't get back there in under five hours, emergency program one will activate.
She's not there. I should have received a signal. The console signals me if there's a teleport breach.
Donna Noble. There's a Donna Noble somewhere in this library. Do you have the software to locate her position?
Donna.
Donna.

I don't know what's wrong though. She's sort of queasy. Indigestion, like she didn't want to land.
I think we've landed inside a cupboard. Here we go.
Some sort of base. Moon base, sea base, space base. They build these things out of kits.
Human design. You've got a thing about kits. This place was put together like a flat pack wardrobe, only bigger. And easier.
Oh, it's a sanctuary base.
Deep Space exploration. We've gone way out. And listen to that, underneath. Someone's drilling.
Oh, it's not that bad.
Hold on, what does that say? That's weird, it won't translate.
Exactly. If that's not working, then it means this writing is old. Very old. Impossibly old. We should find out who's in charge.
We've gone beyond the reach of the Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move. And if someone's lucky enough
Oh! Right. Hello. Sorry. I was just saying, er, nice base.
You've got to what?
Sorry?
Er
No idea. More fun that way.
That's us. Hooray!
What's this planet called, anyway?
Oh, well, that wasn't so bad.
We're fine, thanks, fine. Yeah, don't worry about us.
But that's impossible.
We're standing under a black hole.
But we can't be
But we can't be.
Bad doesn't cover it. A black hole's a dead star. It collapses in on itself, in and in and in until the matter's so dense and tight it starts to pull everything else in too. Nothing in the universe can escape it. Light, gravity, time. Everything just gets pulled inside and crushed.
We should be dead.
We are so far out. Lost in the drifts of the universe. How did you even get here?!
But that field would take phenomenal amounts of power. I mean not just big, but off the scale! Can I?
There we go. Do you see? To generate that gravity field, and the funnel, you'd need a power source with an inverted self extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds.
And it's impossible.
I'm very good.
Or start a war.
I saw that lettering written on the wall. Did you do that?
No, neither can I. And that's saying something.
And you came.
So, when it comes right down to it, why did you come here? Why did you do that? Why? I'll tell you why. Because it was there. Brilliant. Excuse me, er, Zach, wasn't it?
Just stand there, because I'm going to hug you. Is that all right?
Here we go. Come on, then.
Oh, human beings. You are amazing! Ha! Thank you.
But apart from that, you're completely mad. You should pack your bags, get back in that ship and fly for your lives.
Oh, I've got this er, this ship. It's hard to explain. It just sort of appears.
Three.
It was a bit of a cupboard, yeah. Storage six. But you said. You said. You said storage five to eight.
Open the door! Come on!
It can't be. It can't be!
The Tardis is gone.
The earthquake. This section collapsed.
Look down.
The ground gave way. My Tardis must've fallen down right into the heart of the planet. But you've got robot drills heading the same way.
But I need my ship. It's all I've got. Literally the only thing.
I've trapped you here.
Er, no, could you leave it open? Just for a bit. I won't go mad, I promise.
Not that one. It just eats.
Go that way, turn right, keep going for er, about, er, five hundred years, and you'll reach the Earth.
They were grown, not built. And with my own planet gone, we're kind of stuck.
And then what?
I'd have to settle down. Get a house or something. A proper house with, with doors and things. Carpets. Me, living in a house. Now that, that is terrifying.
No.
I'm dying. That's it. I'm dying. It is all over.
Anyway.
I promised Jackie I'd always take you back home.
Not to end up stuck here.
Yeah?
Evening.
Yeah. Sorry, straight to business, the Ood how do they communicate? I mean, with each other.
This telepathic field. Can it pick up messages?
Monitor the field. That's this thing?
Well, that's not basic five. Ten, twenty. They've gone up to basic thirty.
Or something's shouting at them.
He is awake.
Worship who? (no reply) Who's talking to you? Who is it?
Everyone all right?! What happened? What was it?
That wasn't a quake. What caused it?
What happened?
Oh, you've gone native.
I've found her.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
The drill.
Reporting as a volunteer for the expeditionary force.
Yeah, but you trust me, don't you? And you can't let Ida go down there on her own. Go on. Look me in the eye. Yes you do, I can see it. Trust.
The Captain doesn't lead the mission. He stays here, in charge.
Oxygen, nitro balance, gravity. It's ages since I wore one of these.
Yes, sir.
I'll see you later.
It's all right. We've made it. Getting out of the capsule now.
It's hard to tell. Some sort of cave. Cavern. It's massive.
Rose, you can tell Toby we've found his civilisation
Oh, did you have to? No turning back? That's almost as bad as nothing can possible go wrong, or this is going to be the best Christmas Walford's ever had.
Yeah. Finished.
Is everything all right up there?
We've found something. It looks like metal. Like some sort of seal. I've got a nasty feeling the word might be trapdoor. Not a good word, trapdoor. Never met a trapdoor I liked.
That's what trapdoors tend to do.
I suppose that's the writing. It'll tell us what to do. The letters that defy translation.
What is it? What's he done? What's happening? Rose, what's going on?
Rose? What is it, Rose? I'm going back up.

Oh yes, oh yes. Ahh!
Yes, just a little bit weary, Jamie. It's a very exhausting business projecting all those mental images, you know.
Yes, we all do. A nice holiday.
Yes, it's an island on Dulkis, a perfectly splendid planet.
No, no, no, of course not. There's nothing unpleasant on Dulkis.
Oh no, goodness me, no. They're a very advanced race, the Dulcians. And they're very gentle too. And friendly. You're going to like them.
Oh yes, Jamie. Blow that up for me would you?
Yes. Some time ago, mind you. It was splendid. It was so peaceful. I just didn't want to leave.
Yes, that's what we all need. A nice, peaceful holiday.
Well yes, Zoe, they. But Dulcians are gentle and friendly!
Oh no, no, no. This was caused by an explosion some time ago, Jamie.
Yes, I think you're right, Zoe. But I don't understand it. Let's look inside, shall we?
Mind. Over here.
Yes, you're right again, Zoe. A war museum!
Oh yes, but these are very old fashioned weapons, Jamie. This sort of thing was banned ages ago.
No, Jamie, no! Put that down!
Well, it's a sort of laser gun. You know what that'll do. It'll burn a hole through anything. Metal, concrete, wood, anything! It may look old, but, well, you never know. It just might go off. Now please, just leave things as they were. Where was it?
Well that seems to be something
Stay here, Zoe. Come on, Jamie.
They're dummies.
Huh?
That's just what I was thinking. Zoe, I think I did, I. Yes, I'm sure I did.
Yes, yes, I think you're right, Zoe.
But, but, but why on Dulkis? They've outlawed war! There must be some other explanation.
Oh, my beautiful coat is all wet.
All this is totally unnecessary, you know. There's not a trace of contamination on us.
What's odd about it?
Have you checked?
Well, if I were you I'd take them now.
But, but I was hoping you were going to tell us that.
But atomic weapons on Dulkis? I thought war had been abolished here.
Well, as Jamie was about to say, we come from a different world, from a different time.
But when I was here some time ago, you were a peaceful race. What
Well, yes.
Well, well, what's happened to you? I thought aggressive weapons had been abolished?
Then what are you doing letting off atomic devices all over the place?
I see. Then this is an atomic test site?
No. I wonder why?
But why do you think we might be responsible? Thank you.
Tardis.
Oh, it would have registered.
I haven't!
Eh? I don't think I
I don't know. Look, I've never seen this gentleman before in my life.
You say you've seen a spacecraft?
What exactly did this spacecraft look like?
Are you sure it wasn't square, like a large wooden box?
What!
Jamie, we'd better go and see.
I prefer to make up my own mind, thank you. Jamie. Are you coming, Zoe?
Right, we shan't be a minute.
Are you sure there's no radioactivity?
Good.
That's a relief. Jamie, come and have a look at this. It's interesting. Look.
See?
Well I think it must be some sort of survey mark.
Jamie, look.
Some sort of tracks.
Let's follow them, shall we?
Now that really is interesting.
Oh this is interesting, yes. Obviously an interstellar spaceship of considerably advanced design.
That, I think, Jamie, depends upon what you think I am thinking.
Stop it.
Jamie, don't do it.
Oh my word! (Looking down from the next hill are two rectangular beings with round heads with points sticking out of them. Their voices sound like sweet little girls.)
Oh, good heavens.
Now, Jamie.
Jamie!
Do what?
Don't struggle, Jamie. Keep still.
Shush, Jamie. I am trying to listen.
I think they're arranging for some sort of tests.
I don't know. I thought I heard them mention the word intelligence.
Yes. Or how stupid. I wonder which is the more important to them?
He's arranging some sort of intelligence test, Jamie.
Yes, well, you have to put the right shapes into the correct holes. It's quite simple.
Yes, that's what's bothering me. It's too simple.
I'm free. What about you?
Come on.
What are you going to do with us?
Oh, thank you.
Oh. Oh no!
Oh, my hands!
Yes, I'm all right.
An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one, Jamie.
Just act stupid. Do you think you can manage that?
Oh.
Oh, but
But every time we try and get up, there's a
Jump? Jump.
Elec? Elec?
All right, we'll go.
Well. Well, it's some sort of gun, isn't it?
Well, I don't know that I
Hmm?
Oh, oh, I see. Well, guns kill people. Is that what you wanted to know?
Well, I don't think I. You have to put something into it first, And it comes out here, as far as I remember.
Jamie. Jamie, be careful.
Jamie, be careful!
We don't understand guns on Dulkis! We haven't used them for hundreds of years!
Yes! It was the Clever Ones who invented them!
Yes! They lived long ago, you see. There aren't many of them left. They stopped us using guns and things.
Yes!
Well, there are, there are not many. We don't like them much. They tell us what to do, you see.
Oh yes, sir.
Me, too. They're a bloodthirsty lot these Dominators, aren't they?
I don't know. That message they sent. Material readily accessible. Some sort of mineral deposits, do you think?
Well, what do they want the Dulcians as slaves for? They've got the Quarks.
Yes, I think you're right.
Oh, this is splendid!
Well then, where is she? She did arrive safely?
Oh, I've no idea, Jamie. But the Dulcians wouldn't have harmed her, of that I'm certain.
What?
It's not necessary, you see, Jamie. This is a society of total pacifism.
No, no.
But Cully has told you. They were murdered. And I believe him!
Because I have seen these Dominators. We were taken aboard their spacecraft. Believe me, they're callous. Without pity.
And when these horrible tests were over, they just let us go.
I would like to make a suggestion. I know it is the way of Dulkis to discuss and to deliberate, but the situation is urgent. Send someone to the island to confirm what we've told you.
Because they are aggressive, callous and unfeeling. Don't expect them to act and think as you do. They're alien, from another world.
Oh dear, you've got me there.
Well I'm not sure, but I heard them say that the material was readily accessible. Probably some kind of mineral ore.
Yes, but then there's the matter of the disappearance of the radioactivity from the island. That could be significant.
I told you, Jamie. There are no weapons on Dulkis.
Jamie has a point there, you know. Now I suggest you try to get in touch with Balan on the island again. He must know more by now.
Ah.
It's no use!
It's too late!
It's a robot!
Yes! Now perhaps you'll believe me.
Now, Jamie, what did you want to tell me?
What do you mean?
Yes, right.
No, Jamie, not exactly. Oh dear, this is rather complicated.
Well, Jamie, as you said, this capsule is homing straight back onto the survey unit, and the Quarks are there.
Yes, I know. Thank you. Now don't worry. All I've got to do is to override the automatic pilot.
Ah, no, no, Jamie, there don't seem to be. But the simplest way is to get straight at the control mechanism.
Yes, now it's all right, Jamie, just leave it all to me. The trouble is all the wires seem to be leading up into the nose. Just hold this for me for a minute, will you Jamie? Let's see whether I can scramble through here. Just wait a minute. we're nearly there. Oh!
I've nearly got it, Jamie. Yes, I think I've got it.
Well, there won't be time for another try, you know. Oh, give us a hand. Pull me back.
Oh, there we are, yes. Yes, I think I've done it. Now then, hold on and I'm going to try and steer this thing.
Well, at least we know it works, don't we.
Of course I can. I'll get us down in no time at all.
Now just hold on.
Oh, no bones broken. Oh dear. Oh, there we are. Oh, my word, Ah. Well, I think we've done rather well so far, don't you?
It was just a bit bumpy. Oh now then, the main thing is we weren't spotted. Now come along, we've got to find Zoe and the others.
It's the ruined building. Hello.
We've got to get down there. Jamie, we'll split up and get around the back of them. I'll cut across those cliffs.
Oh, but I do. Whenever I see one I go away. But they're all over the island. Where can I go?
But Jamie was in that building!
All right, all right.
A little internal dispute I fancy. Oh dear.
Well I'm not sure.
No!
Yes, yes, yes, so you did.
Yes. Yes, Senex is at the Capital.
Well, you can't. The terminal at the survey unit was destroyed, wasn't it.
But, are you going to take your own craft to the Capital?
Well actually, now I come to think of it, I do know where there is a capsule. I didn't tell you about it before because I'm not sure that it works. It has some loose wires and things, but I'm sure that you'll be able to fix it.
Oh dear, I don't
Well actually, now I come to think of it, if you were to take out one of the seats, a Quark might fit inside.
Oh yes.
Don't worry, Zoe. The effect soon wears off.
Well if he takes this craft we won't be able to investigate it, will we?
To find out what sort of power unit it has. Then we can tell what the Dominators are looking for on Dulkis. Besides, if they take us to the Capital we won't be able to search for Jamie, will we?
Yes.
There you are, you see? All right. It's all right!
Of course.
Why didn't you tell me about this underground shelter before?
Well it's possible, it's possible.
Well, I think.
Oh yes. All right.
I don't know. We must find out exactly what they're drilling for.
Yes. If only we could create a diversion for a moment.
Only one person here's strong enough to do that.
Yes, alive and kicking by the sound of it. This is just what we needed. Now there's no time to waste.
Well, now's our chance to investigate the power unit and find out what fuel this ship carries.
Yes. Must be pretty powerful too.
Oh I do, I do, I do, Zoe. Now, where do you think the power cells are located?
No. Ultrasound has no horsepower, as such.
No. More likely to be electromagnetic, probably produced by. Ah yes! Here we are, Zoe. Help me to get the inspection cover off.
Here we are. Now then. Oh dear.
No. No, not exactly. But it's radioactive material of some sort. Zoe, this is a storage unit! That accounts for the strange disappearance of the radioactivity from the island. This unit sucked it up and stored it.
Yes. Er, Balan. Oh. (nearly walks into a Quark) Balan, can you remember where the scientists who exploded that first atomic device got their materials from?
But perhaps that's why they've chosen this place! The magma, the molten core of the planet, could that be radioactive?
It's these drill holes that intrigue me. One at each corner of a square, and one directly in the middle. But why? Why?
Hmm?
They're drilling.
Hmm? Oh, I don't think they want to take anything out of the earth, Zoe, rather put something into it.
Well, if I'm right. Oh no!
Excuse me. I wonder
That was very rash of you, Jamie. Those Quarks are appallingly dangerous.
I'm afraid not. Nowhere on the island is safe. Nowhere on the entire planet, come to that.
I'm afraid they do.
A large amount of fuel for their invasion fleet.
They're not mining for minerals, or any natural fuel source.
But there was no reactor in their ship of theirs, only a radiation storage unit. You remember how, when they landed, it sucked up all the radioactive dust from the island?
Exactly.
Look, I'll show you. (The Doctor uses a piece of chalk to draw on the table.)
There are four drill holes, here, here, here and here. And one drill hole in the centre. Now then, they have rockets mounted in each of these drill holes, and the centre hole is probably for that atomic seed device.
Well don't you see? They've chosen this spot because the crust of the planet is thin. They're going to fire the rockets through the crust into the magma, the molten core.
Exactly.
Yes, that's right, Zoe. The whole planet will become one vast molten mass of radioactive material. The fuel store for their fleet.
Oh Jamie, it's not as simple as that, is it? If only I could get hold of that atomic seed device, I might be able to defuse it.
Yes.
Yes, that's the problem.
Shush a minute Jamie, I'm trying to think.
Yes.
But Jamie, it's a brilliant idea! It's so simple only you could have thought of it.
Yes, there's only one snag though. Could we complete the tunnel in time? It'd have to be twelve feet long or more.
Yes, that's true, but you've been lucky so far. If only I could devise some sort of weapon for you. Is anything down here, Cully?
Medical kit, oh. It's surprising what you can do with a few simple chemicals and a little ingenuity. Now come on, we must dig this tunnel. Zoe, give us a direction will you?
Right! We start there tunnel there. Get that bunk away. Come on.
I think you'd better let me start it, Jamie.
It's a little more than a screwdriver. Just watch this.
Hang on, Jamie. This is ready. Now if this works you should have a good chance of distracting the Quarks, and maybe even destroying one or two of them. Right, come on, Zoe, let's try it.
Yes, in here. There you are. Just a bit.
Whoa, whoa, that'll do. Now then, Jamie, all you've got to do is to add one of these little number nine pills to each bottle just before you throw it, like that.
But whatever you do, and this is important, you must throw it before ten seconds have elapsed, otherwise you're liable to blow up with
What?
It works!
No, no, Jamie, that was just a small quantity. But with ten times that amount you should have quite a handy little bomb.
Oh dear. It's obviously going to take quite a disturbance to stop them drilling. Teel? Teel, how far have you got?
Teel, come out and take your rest. Zoe, your turn. Come on.
It sounds as though they're having great fun.
Yes, but they must be nearly finished by now.
No, they're still up there. Unfortunately they're taking
Yes.
Yes, I know, I can hear it up there. We must be pretty near.
Shush.
What happened?
My word, lucky indeed! Come along, down you come. All right, Cully. Get over to the bunk. Get the table out of the way. Here. There we are. It's all right, Cully. Sit down. Mind your head. There we are, there. Now then.
Can you move your fingers? Ah, you're lucky. I think it's only temporary paralysis.
Thanks to you and Jamie, it's nearly finished.
What? We've still got a few feet left!
Can you see the borehole yet, Jamie?
Oh dear.
Argh!
Not just yet. I've still got to defuse it before they explode it. Oh. Oh, my word.
Well, it's sealed. It's completely sealed! I can't possibly undo it!
Yes, I'm afraid so, unless I can think of some way of getting it off the planet without a
Well, there is a way of getting it off the planet without it doing any harm to any of us at all.
Ha! But it's not going to be easy.
Now just leave it to me, Jamie. You and Zoe go back to the Tardis. Teel, take Kando and Cully and get them to the capsule and go to the Capital. Tell them that there'll be a minor volcanic eruption, but with any luck nothing more violent.
There isn't time, Jamie! Come along!
Don't ask me any questions. There's no time.
It's the rockets in the other perimeter holes. Come along. We'd better get inside the Tardis. There's going to be an all
Oh, it's quite all right, Jamie. The planet is quite safe. There's just going to be a localised volcanic eruption. It'll only affect the island.
Oh, my word!

What's wrong? You're not happy. Why aren't you happy? Tell me.
Why have you brought us here?
Underwater. Some sort of a base. The technology's twenty second century. Maybe military, maybe scientific.
Must be, somewhere, if there's oxygen.
DOCTOR; Well. Looks like you got your wish.
I think there was more to it than that. Whatever it was, it happened pretty recently.
Seven or eight hours ago. No bodies, though.
Look. Told you. Crew.
Hello, sailors!
Right, I did not expect that. Hands up who expected that.
Wait, wait. I don't think they're going to hurt us. I think that they're just curious.
Well, I mean, define sure. Look at you lovely chaps. What's happened to you, then?
Come on.
I haven't a clue. Isn't that exciting?
No, it's alien.
That's weird. The Tardis hasn't translated it.
Hello! Did you want to show us this? It's very nice.
Yes, I spotted that, too.
Was it something she said? She does that. She once had an argument with Gandhi!
What are
This is Clara, and I'm the Doctor.
Well, if that's what it says.
Tell me, what about those things out there? What are they? Why are they trying to kill us?
They're not ghosts.
Thank you, but I actually don't need your help. I can speak sign. (signs) Go ahead.
No, no, actually,I can't. It's been deleted for semaphore. Someone get me a selection of flags.
He's from the planet Tivoli.
Weird thing is, they're not violent. They're too cowardly. They wouldn't say boo to a goose. They're more likely to give the goose their car keys and bank details. When did they first appear?
It's a Faraday cage. Completely impenetrable to radio waves, and apparently, whatever those things are out there. So, who's in charge now? I need to know who to ignore.
The oil? Where are we?
I'd like to have a further look at that spaceship, but what about those things that aren't ghosts?
If whatever they are
They're not ghosts. Have been trying to kill you, why haven't you abandoned the base?
It's okay. I understand. You're an idiot. Come to mention it, why is there a Faraday cage on the base?
So, we are fighting an unknown homicidal force that has taken the form of your commanding officer and a cowardly alien, underwater, in a nuclear reactor. Anything else I should know? Someone got a peanut allergy, or something?
It all started with this ship. This is where the answer will be.
What's happened to the stuff you've removed? This is for long-haul flights. There should be a suspended-animation chamber for the pilot right here. Plus, one of the power cells is missing.
Yeah. You can see the casing is empty.
What?
Well, they can zap a vessel from one side of the galaxy to the other, so, you know, take a wild stab in the dark.
Yes, well, otherwise. Sorry, why is this man still talking to me?
So what have we got? Moran dies, and then those things appear. They can walk through walls. They only come out at night and they're sort of see-through.
They're ghosts! Yeah, ghosts
Yes, well, well, there was no such thing as, as socks or smartphones and badgers until there suddenly were. Besides, what else could they be? They're not holograms, they're not Flesh Avatars, they're not Autons, they're not digital copies bouncing around the Nethersphere. No, these people are literally, actually, dead. Wow. This is, it's amazing! I've never actually met a proper ghost.
Oh! Oh, right you are.
Ahem. I'm very sorry for your loss. I'll do all I can to solve the death of your friend slash family member slash pet.
But don't you see what this means? Death! It was the one thing that unified every single living creature in the universe, and now it's gone. How can you just sit there? Don't you want to go out there right now, wrestle them to the ground and ask them questions until your throat falls out? What's death like? Does it hurt? Do you still get hungry? Do you miss being alive? Why can you only handle metal objects? Oh, I didn't know I'd noticed that. Okay, so they'll try to kill you, blah, blah, blah. What does that matter? You come back. A bit murder-y, sure, but even so! Calm, Doctor, calm. You were like this when you met Shirley Bassey. Okay. Question one. What is a ghost? Question two. What do they want?
The Tardis Cloister Bell!
It must be the ghosts. That's why she was upset when we got here.
It's just what I was saying. You live and you die. That's it. The ghosts are aberrations. A splinter of time in the skin. They're unnatural. She wants to get away from them.
Put the handbrake on.
Whoa! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Where do you think you're going?
Look, you, er
Oh, this is my own fault. I like adventures as much as the next man. If the next man is a man who likes adventures. Even so, don't, don't go native.
Look, there's a wholedimension in here, but there's only room for one
Do you know what you need? You need a hobby.
Or even better, another relationship. Come on, you lot, you're bananas about relationships. You're always writing songs about them, or going to war, or getting tattooed
I just felt that I, I, I had to say something.
Because I've got a duty of care.
So can I stop now?
They're working out how to use the base against us. Altering the time settings so they can go about uninhibited, opening the airlocks. They're learning.
Wait, wait.
(sotto) Yes, we're coming back.
Topside, this is the Doctor, UNIT security visa seven one zero Apple zero zero. You may be familiar with my work. Call back the sub.
Call it back! We have a hazardous and undefined contagion on board. This base is now under quarantine.
Well, none of us sent the message, did we? So that means that the ghosts sent it, which means they want that crew down here.
Well, I don't know, but I'm pretty certain it's not so they can all form a boy band. Okay. We solve this on our own. The ghosts can only come out at night so they change the base's time settings. Why? What's different at night?
No. Something, something else.
What systems specifically?
The answer is in there somewhere, I can smell it.
O'Donnell. Excellent work, returning the base to day mode.
Now put it back into night mode.
We know nothing. We don't know what they want. That's what's getting us killed. Well, I won't run. Not any more. So, O'Donnell, kindly put the base back into night mode. We want to know what these ghosts are after? We ask them. We're going to do the impossible. We're going to capture a ghost.
Clara, Bennett is going to run across the top of the T-junction to your right
In about ten seconds. Draw the ghosts towards you. Turn right, and then take second left.
Lunn, they're coming your way. Clara's going to duck down to her left. You've got to keep the ghosts going on the same route they're on now.
Then, after about fifty yards on your left, there is a flood door.
O'Donnell will close the door once you're through.
Lunn, don't let them see where you go.
What?
Clara, there's a flood door at the end of the corridor, around the corner to your right. We'll close it from here. Listen to me. You've got to get through that door before Moran and the other ghost sees you.
Now, O'Donnell, fast as you can!
Now, Lunn, quickly.
No, no, Lunn. Lunn, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Lunn, what's happening?
Lunn, can you hear me? Lunn? Lunn?
Can you hear me? Lunn, Lunn? Lunn, Lunn! What's happening? Lunn? Lunn? Can you hear me?
What? What's wrong with
Bennett, can you hear me?
There are two ghosts just around the corner from you.
The Faraday cage is across the intersection and down the corridor to your right. This last bit is down to you.
We need to talk. Sorry, chaps. Just a hologram. You play a little bit too rough.
Cass, are you seeing this?
Open the door.
They don't have any weapons or access to any of the controls. They can't hurt me, so open the door.
Cold, isn't it? Take away your weapons and you're not so scary, are you? Is that better, Cass?
What?
Dark, sword, forsaken, temple. What does that mean? What are you  telling me, big man? Bennett! I need maps. I think I just worked out  what our friend here is telling us.
They're coordinates.
The dark? Space. So, whoever's following the coordinates knows they're going to another planet. The sword?
Orion's sword. The sword, the three stars, although one isn't actually a star but the Orion Nebula, hanging down from Orion's belt. But if viewed from back here, the Earth becomes the fourth bit of the sword. So, narrowed it down to a planet now. Getting closer.
The forsaken. The forsaken or abandoned or empty town. See, it's a location, beaming out to someone or something across the universe, over and over. And every time they kill one of us
Get more people down here, kill them, make even more ghosts to beam out the coordinates.
It could be. Or a warning. Might even be a call to arms. It could mean, come here, they're vulnerable, help yourself. Wait a minute, though. Wait a minuet. Do you know what this means? It means that they're not a natural phenomenon. It means that someone is deliberately getting people killed, hijacking their souls and turning them into transmitters.
Ah! What the coordinates are for. That is part of the answer to the other question you're all thinking. (blank stares) Really? Come on. None of you? Surely just being around me makes you cleverer by osmosis? What is the other question?
Finally. It's like pulling teeth. This is the flooded military town. Shops, houses, town square, and this.
Whatever the coordinates are for, it's in that church. Find that and you're a hop, skip and a jump to stopping them.
No one has to stay. In fact, I would prefer it if you went. You'll all get in the way and ask ridiculous questions. But, you know, (indicates Cass, Lunn and O'Donnell)
Something that has the power to raise the dead and turn them into transmitters. I expect we'll know it when we see it.
That's it, keep going.
Wait. What's that? Move closer.
It's the suspended-animation chamber from the spaceship.
There's
Not translated by the Tardis. Why?
Lunn, translate for me. Whenever I step outside, you are the smartest person in the room. So, tell me, what's weird about this? I know that it's all bonkers but, you know, when
The markings on the inside of the spaceship. Yes! Why?
They're not. They're magnets.
Well, a localised and manufactured electromagnetic field, to be precise. The dark. The sword. The forsaken. The temple. When we heard the coordinates for the first time, did anyone expect them not to be that? No, exactly. Me neither. It's like we already knew, somehow. Like the words were already in us.
Everything we see or experience shapes us in some way. But these words actually rewrite the synaptic connections in your brain. They literally change the way you are wired. Clara, why don't I have a radio in the Tardis?

Waiting for his slash her slash its mates to pick the message up. My  God. Every time I think it couldn't get more extraordinary, it surprises me. It's impossible. I hate it. It's evil. It's astonishing. I want to kiss it to death.
Where's the Tardis?
We need to get there. It's our only way out.
I'll get you and the others out. Sit tight, I'll come back for you.
The Tardis won't go there. It won't go near the ghosts.
Listen to me. I'm going back in time to when this spaceship landed. If I can understand why this is happening, I can stop them killing anyone else. I can save you. You trust me, don't you, Clara?
Extremely well.
Back to before the flood.

Hmm. Nearly there.
Oh, just mild mental disorientation. Nothing that forty eight hours of induced D-sleep won't cure.
Yes, of course. There's no need to shout. Come along, Nyssa.
Well done, Adric. It's functioning as a delta waveform generator.
Why should we need it?
There you are, Tegan. There's always something to look at if you open your eyes.
Good question. Any ideas?
Go on, I'm sure it's safe.
Wait a minute. That one again. Now that one. A perfect fifth. A chromatic structure in eccentric sequence. Eccentric, that is, to our ears, not to the ears of whoever built it.
Adric!
Adric, don't wander off. Not on a new planet. So, Tegan, the question is, who built it and what is it for?
Of course, to build this, to achieve the delicate resonances involved, would require a high level of technical skill. And yet, look around you. No signs of civilisation, no cultivation, no roadways, even. And yet whoever built this must have a musical sense not unlike, not entirely unlike, our own. Are you sure you're all right?
Must be the fresh air. It's very puzzling, don't you think?
Now where's he got to?
No, Adric!
Whatever it is, it could be distinctly unfriendly. Look at it.
Hmm. It's obviously an armoured suit of some kind. I would say its occupant was probably human in shape
Binocular, bipedal, and the whole thing is controlled directly from the brain of the wearer with these.
Or she, or
No, Adric!
Stand still. Don't move. Not a muscle.
Adric.
There is a difference between serious scientific investigation and meddling.
Isn't there?
That's better.
No. Besides, it looks as if we've arrived.
Look, I was right. Two arms, binocular, bipedal. Human, or humanoid at the very least. I'm delighted to meet you.
Intentions unknown. Hypothesis unfriendly, as K9 would say.
Roberts? Was Roberts
I'd be very pleased to. It's a little difficult to concentrate
Thank you.
Well, I'm afraid we can't help you. The, er, thing was empty when we came across it.
S14?
The Kinda are the native lifeform.
Who built the chimes.
Could you repeat the question?
Just passing through. Look, I don't suppose there's a chance of some breakfast? Are you hungry, Adric? Adric? He usually is. Boys, you know. If you could oblige? Look, if we turn out to be hostile, then fair enough. Until we do, why not give us the benefit of the doubt? It's commonsense really, don't you think?
The ILF?
The Kinda.
Ah, no, no. I don't seem to be very, er. These difficulties you referred to?
Roberts?
What, do you think the Kinda took them?
Are the Kinda dangerous?
Used to?
The hostages?
Could I see them?
I've a friend still in the forest. I'm quite concerned for her safety. I'd like to know how much of a threat the Kinda are.
Hmm. Complete lack of neuromuscular reaction. They're not sulking. Shock, wouldn't you think, in the circumstances? Your arrival here must have come as something of a surprise, and then to lock them up.
Oh, illogical. Please let me out of here. Have you any idea of the affect upon a primitive mind
Well, it could be the double helix.
Thank you. What could they know of molecular biology?
Which means the Kinda have no need of shelter and no fears for food supply.
What?
I thought the native produce was forbidden.
Yes.
What?
There's a Kinda out there now.
He doesn't look as if he's living in paradise.
What are your plans for this planet?
Oh, well, of course, if Hindle would have a fit.
An apple a day keeps the er. No, never mind.
I don't think that's
Nothing.
Can I come with you?
I'm quite concerned about my friend Tegan.
That may not be enough.
He's not altogether stable. In fact I think he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Well, er, logically, that one.
That's rather clever, Adric. Don't you think so? You have unexpected talents.
Well now, logic would dictate that one (the right) but wait, no, I'll try and second guess you. That one.
Oh, that one, then.
That one.
Where, then?
No, no, no, quite impossible. That would be in direct contradiction to the laws of the material universe.
Oh, er, well, that one. That one.
Ah, yes, of course. Can I try?
Should we?
How?
Choose.
Go on.
You're sure?
Not the other one?
Yes?
Shush.
Absolutely. There's nothing we can do about Tegan at the moment. I'm just hoping she's safe.
Rather what?
Oh?
Oh dear.
Well, perhaps it might
Well, you don't have to.
And then?
What are you defending the dome against?
Oh, I see.
Well, perhaps if we could define the exact nature of the threat posed by the trees
Yes, but I
Nearly, nearly, nearly. I thought that the Kinda
Of?
Why do you think the plants are hostile?
Adric?
I don't know.
I'd like to know what he's up to.
What's he up to?
Fire and acid?
Oh, good. That is good news, isn't it. If in doubt, then fire and acid every time, don't you think?
Ravenous.
What?
Oh, I see. A little game. Yes, er. That one.
No, no, er, that one, then.
Certainly.
Are you sure?
Look, it's only a game.
Don't hurt him!
Don't.
(to Todd) I think your guess was right. The Kinda are telepathic.
I don't know. I've tried to communicate with them myself but I can't get through.
Look, I have a suggestion.
Well, I was simply going to suggest that you banished him from the dome, left him at the mercy of the trees.
Oh yes, I was forgetting.
He's the first to return, isn't he.
Good. Then we may find out what happened to the others.
Well, there may be another reason.
Something more hostile out there.
Well now, if the Kinda are more sophisticated than they first appear, is it not possible that their enemies are also?
Hmm.
Not half so much as Hindle frightens me.
Where did you get the box?
By whom?
Yes, I know. Sanders, do you know what's in the box?
I don't think that would be very wise.
It could be very dangerous.
Unfortunately, so could he.
Well, we've established one thing.
The Kinda have a sense of humour.
Absolutely nothing. Wait.
I think it's safe to assume we all three had the same experience. How do you feel?
Not different?
Somehow the box linked us up with the Kinda. We were seeing the world through their eyes.
Yes. It's shock. He'll be all right. Come on.
You were right. This is no planet of primitives, and the answer's out there in the forest. Come on. Leave the box.
He'll be all right, he's very resourceful. Quickly!
Well jump!
Has anyone ever told you you ask a lot of questions?
Yes, so you are.
Er, that way.
Come on.
Yes.
We're lost.
Well, I thought the cave in the dream.
Oh, absolutely.
Tell you what, toss for it. Heads this way, tails that. (tosses the coin) Heads.
Heads.
Nonsense.
There's something following us.
Look.
Culturally non-hostile, didn't you say?
Yes, we take the point, don't we.
Er, well, I don't really see what I could, er. Wait a minute.
It's all quite simple, really. Just a, just a matter of practice. Your turn.
I thought you said the Kinda had no voice.
Well he certainly seems to.
It's the girl from the dream.
The prophecy?
Gladly.
Where are we going? I expect you know these woods backwards, eh? Well, I don't suppose you've come across a young woman?
Yes, that's her. Tegan.
Now, where is she?
Well, is that far?
(to Todd) Come on.
Now, this person Aris.
You said he'd been sick.
Yes, but now he can speak. He has voice.
Yes, but so do you.
Panna?
Is he? How many do you have?
Seven.
Isn't that rather extravagant?
Well, on the whole, one.
Yes.
Such stuff as dreams are made of.
Hello.
Yes. Most enlightening.
Well, I suppose I must be. I have been called one many
Yes.
What is?
You said once again.
And I suppose this happens many times.
Did you see the design on his arm?
Yes, that's right.
What do you know of the Mara?
I too have heard the legends of the Mara.
We must do as she says.
Look.
You heard Panna. This is the beginning and the end.
We can't.
Did you recognise the laugh?
No, the Mara within him.
In a manner of speaking.
Both. And now we must get back to the dome, stop the attack.
Well, the old woman must direct us.
What?
In certain states of deep trance the bodily functions slow down to such an extent that they are barely perceptible, thus freeing the mind to such as we have seen. However, on this occasion it seems
Panna's dead.
Well, unlikely, perhaps.
Er, well, it's a good scientific question. Where are you?
Both of you.
So, when Panna died, her knowledge and experience were passed over to you.
Well, did you see it?
Well, so did I.
Unless we stop the attack on the dome.
And somehow one of them has crossed over into this world and has taken over the mind of Aris. One thing puzzles me.
How did it cross over?
Which is?
Of course. Tegan.
Tegan.
What is the function of the chimes?
Share? Share what? Minds?
What would happen if one person dreamt here alone?
Then I have to wake her.
I have to take that risk. Tegan? Tegan!
Are you all right?
Dream?
What dream?
Now come on, Tegan, you must tell me.
You've been asleep for nearly two days.
Oh, not now, Tegan, please, there's no time. You must tell me about the dream. It's very important.
Yes, of course. The other man standing there laughing. Go on.
What, a snake?
Well, was it?
Good. Go on.
You weren't yourself.
Aris.
Don't be silly, Tegan, it can't have been. Come on, what did you do?
No, of course you weren't.
Isn't it obvious? Your mind and body were occupied the Mara, who found its path to this world through your dream, just as Karuna said.
Oh, it's all right, you're perfectly safe now. In fact, I'll introduce you.
They're about to attack the dome.
Come on.
I have an idea it's controller is rather inexperienced.
Adric, stop! Listen to me! This is the Doctor.
That's good. Now listen, Adric, I know you're frightened, but you must understand that it's your fear that's controlling the machine. It operates directly from your brainwaves. Do you understand? That's good. Now listen. You have nothing to fear, just open the machine. You must come out.
Are you all right?
Look after Adric.
Come on!
Have you? Oh, good. There's nothing quite like it, is there.
What is it?
Yes, of course.
And the security arrangements?
No. No, no. I'd rather know how you control the Kinda.
Mirrors. Yes, very clever.
Yes. May I
I'm so sorry.
When I what?
Deactivated. All quite harmless now.
He now appears to see the situation in quite a different light.
He opened the box.
The Box of Jhana, the box Sanders was given by the Kinda.
Yes.
The box is a powerful Kinda healing device. I suspect it generates sound at a frequency beyond our ears.
Helps bring the mind back into phase.
With everything. With life out there. The Kinda are very sophisticated people.
Oh, yes. The more the mind is out of phase to begin with, the more dramatic the apparent effect.
I'll explain everything in greater detail later.
First we must deal with the Mara. Where's Aris?
Escaped?
Well, we must find him quickly, before he's destroyed by the Mara within him.
I don't know yet.
What? Oh, the mirror. They thought he'd captured their. Ah.
I don't suppose you've come across any large mirrors in your wanderings about the dome? Silly question really.
Well, reflective surfaces of any kind. Come on, quickly, think.
Where?
Show me.
What is the one thing evil cannot face? Not ever.
Itself.
Ah, Hindle captured their innocence. The Mara will rebel. They cannot face themselves, don't you see?
Good. Adric, Tegan, he's coming.
Well, according to the legends.
No Mara can bear the sight of its own reflection. It must recoil from itself. Understandably, don't you think, given it's nature.
Very well then. Trapped in a circle of mirrors, each mirror reflecting not only the Mara itself but also
In an endless series.
Exactly.
It retreats back to where it came from.
Or wherever, but not here, that's the main thing. It's all quite logical.
Well, Tegan survived, but
Well, it would do no harm, would it, to keep ones fingers crossed.
Ah, there you are. We thought you'd got lost.
I'm called the Doctor.
Because I share the Kinda's aim where you're concerned.
Well, you did for a while, but no longer.
Yes, so I hear, but it is the voice of a Mara in the body of Aris. The snake on your arm, the symbol of your power, confirms it.
Oh, you're too late. Now!
Now, get ready to pull Aris clear the moment the snake leaves his arm.
Hold the mirrors straight!
The Mara is detaching itself.
It's leaving Aris. It has no further use for him.
Now, pull him clear!
Now, hold your ground. Keep it in the circle. Close the gaps! The circle must be kept closed. If the circle is closed, the Mara cannot escape.
Tegan! Tegan, Tegan, are you all right?
Close these gaps!
Yes.
Yes.
It's all right, it's all right. Stand firm. Look, it's starting to weaken. Look!
He'll be all right.
Who can tell?
Back to the dark places of the inside, or wherever. But not here, not anywhere here. This world is free of it.
Come on, it's finished.
Is it decided?
Which is?
Is he?
Oh, he'll be all right. He was just driven out of his mind. Just what he needed. What about you, will you stay?
You're not tempted by paradise?
Ah, yes, one moment.
Oh no. That would be completely impossible, wouldn't it.
If not ridiculous.
Yes. It seems some people are getting impatient.
Goodbye.
Nyssa, how are you?
Excellent.
Oh, nothing much. This and that. Having fun.
I don't see why not.
I think paradise is a little too green for me as well.

Hello, I'm the Doctor. Happy Easter.
The funny thing is, I don't often do Easter. I can never find it. It's always at a different time. Although I remember the original. Between you and me, what really happened was.
Oh. Sorry, hold on to that for me. Actually, go on, have it. Finish it. It's full of sugar and I'm determined to keep these teeth.
Ah. Oh, we've got excitation. I'm picking up something very strange.
Rhondium particles, that's what I'm looking for. This thing detects them. Look, this should to round, that little dish there.
Ah, the little dish is going round.
And round. Whoa.
Sorry. That was my little dish.
What was your name?
Christina, hold on tight. Everyone, hold on!
End of the line. Call it a hunch, but I think we've gone a little bit further than Brixton.
Me too.
I'm the Doctor.
The Doctor.
The Doctor.
Yes, I am.
Funny sort of sand, this. There's a trace of something else. (he tastes it) Glah. Not good.
No, it tastes like. Never mind.
Oh, humans on buses, always blaming me. Look, look, if you must know, I was tracking a hole in the fabric of reality. Call it a hobby. But it was a tiny little hole. No danger to anyone. Suddenly it gets big, and we drive right through it.
All right. You want proof? We drove through this.
A door. A door in space.
The bus came through, but we can't.
No, no, don't.
I said don't.
It was the bus. Look at the damage. That was the bus protecting us. Great big box of metal.
Well, slightly different dynamics with a wormhole. There's enough metal to make it work, I think. I hope.
I'd say nine and a half tons, but the point still stands, yes.
Yes. At last. Thank you. So.
Yes, ma'am.
Hello.
I thought you were in charge.
Right. So, the wormhole. We were in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was just an accident.
How do you know?
Tell me, Carmen. How many fingers am I holding up?
Very good. Low level psychic ability, exacerbated by an alien sun. What can you see, Carmen? Tell me, what's out there?
What is it?
All right now, stop it. Everyone, stop it! Angela, look at me. Angela? Angela? Answer me one question, Angela. That's it. At me, at me. There we go. Angela, just answer me one thing. When you got on this bus, where were you going?
Answer the question.
And what's home?
Suzanne. Good. What about you?
Who's Tina? Your girlfriend?
Good boy. What about you, Nathan?
Brilliant. And you two?
What's for tea?
Oh, that's special, Lou. That is so special. Chops and gravy, mmm. What about you, Christina?
Far away. Chops and gravy. Watching TV. Mike and Suzanne and poor old Tina.
Just think of them. Because that planet out there, all three suns, wormholes and alien sand, that planet is nothing. You hear me? Nothing, compared to all those things waiting for you. Food and home and people. Hold on to that, because we're going to get there. I promise. I'm going to get you home.
That's my boys. See, we lay a flat surface between the bus and the wormhole, like duckboards, and we reverse into it.
Oh, that's good.
Got anything else in there?
Oh no, buses don't have keys. There's a master switch, then it's one button to start, the other one to stop, yeah?
Ooo, that doesn't sound too good.
Oh, never mind losing half the top deck. You know what's worse? Sand. Tiny little grains of sand. The engine's clogged up.
Off you go, then. Try stripping the air filter. Fast as you can. Back in two ticks.
Easier if you left that backpack behind.
A backpack with a spade and an axe. Christina, who's going so far away, and yet scared by the sound of a siren. Who are you?
We make quite a couple.
I don't know, but every single instinct of mine is telling me to get off this planet right now.
I live in hope.
Ooo, that's handy, because I'm a Lord.
It's quite a big estate.
Like?
Anyway, come on. Allons-y.
Oh, we were made for each other.
Ah, don't like the look of that.
But getting closer.
It's a storm. Who says it's sand?
Where is it?
Oh, just watch me. Right. Now, bit of hush, thank you. Got to remember the number, very important number.
And again. Ah. seven six, not six seven.
Oh, I hate these things.
Thank you, Angela.
Listen, it's the Doctor. It's me.
Did you just salute?
Erisa, it's about the bus. HQ said you're at the tunnel, yeah?
I'm on the bus.
But apart from that, not a clue, except it's very pretty and pretty dangerous.
No, and we're not going to, but I'm stuck. I haven't got the Tardis, and I need to analyse that wormhole.
Oh, is he? We'll see about that.
I can hear everything you're saying.
Yes, I am. Hello, Malcolm.
Really? What was your favourite, the giant robot? No, no, hold on. Let's sort out that wormhole. Excuse me.
Malcolm, something's not making sense here. I've got a storm and a wormhole, and I can't help thinking there's a connection. I need a complete full range analysis
Of that wormhole. The whole thing.
No. No, no, no, no, no. That'll never work. Listen.
Fifteen what?
You named a unit of measurement after yourself?
And who's that
Your dad?
Right. Fine. But before I die of old age, which in my case would be quite an achievement, so congratulations on that
Is there anyone else I can talk to?
You did what?
No. Malcolm, that's brilliant. So you can actually measure the wormhole. Okay.
I admit that is genius.
Now, run a capacity scan.
I need a full report. Call me back when you've done it. And Malcolm?
You're my new best friend.
Barclay, I'm holding on to this.
Send this back to Earth. See if Malcolm can analyse the storm.
Like metal. Why would there be metal in a storm?
Hold on. Busy.
That's wait. I shout wait, people usually wait.
Every language. (chitters) That's begging for mercy.
Ooo, you're learning.
No, no, no, no, no. Look at the ship. It's a wreck. They crashed, just like us.
Mmm. The hull's made of photafine steel. Turns cold when it's hot. Boiling desert outside, freezing ship inside. Since I met you, Christina, we've been through all the extremes.
Oh, this is beautiful. Intact, it must have been magnificent. A proper streamlined deep spacer.
Oh, right, good. Yes. Hello. That's a telepathic translator. He can understand us.
That's what I said. He can understand us. It doesn't work the other way round. (translates) You will suffer for your crimes, etcetera. You have committed an act of violence against the Tritovore race. Tritovores. They're called Tritovores. You came here in the two hundred to destroy us. Sorry, what's the two hundred?
Oh. No, look, I think you're making the same mistake Christina did. I'm the Doctor, by the way, and this is Christina. The Honourable Lady Christina. At least I hope she's honourable. We got pulled through that wormhole. The two hundred doesn't look like that normally. It's broken, just the same as you.
They believe me.
I've got a very honest face. And the translator says I'm telling the truth. Plus the face. Right. So, first things first. There's a very strange storm heading our way. Can you send out a probe? Oh, they've lost power. Hmm, the crash knocked the mainline crystallography out of synch. But if I can jiggle it back.
I thank you. Yes, I am. Frequently. Okey doke, let's launch that probe.
The Scorpion Nebula. We're on the other side of the universe. Just what you wanted. So far away. The planet of San Helios.
We have been for quite a while.
It's good, isn't it?
The Tritovores were going to trade with San Helios. Population of one hundred billion. Plenty of waste matter for them to absorb.
They feed off what others leave behind from their behind, if you see what I mean. It's perfectly natural. They are flies.
San Helios City.
Thousands of times.
DOCTOR; Of Time. I come from a race of people called Time Lords.
Yeah. But you don't have to kiss me either.
You look Time Lord. Anyway.
I don't think it's that simple. We're in the city right now.
The image was taken last year.
I said there was something in the sand. The city, the oceans, the mountains, the wildlife, and a hundred billion people turned to sand. All those voices in Carmen's head. She's hearing them die.
Something destroyed the whole of San Helois.
Malcolm, tell me the bad news.
How can it get bigger by itself?
Good work, both of you.
Oh, sorry. Call waiting. Got to go.
Yeah?
Why, what's happened?
It's the probe. It's reached the storm.
It's not a storm.
Billions. Oh, we've lost the probe. I think it got eaten. Everything on this planet gets eaten.
A hundred miles. But at that speed, it'll be here in twenty minutes. No, no, no, they're not just coming for us. They want the wormhole.
Show the analysis. Incredible. They swarm out of a wormhole, strip the planet bare, then move on to the next world. Start the life cycle all over again.
They must do.
Because they need to be? No, that's bonkers. Hang on. Yes. Oh, do you see? Billions of them, flying in formation, all around the planet. Round and round and round, faster and faster and faster, till they generate a rupture in space. The speed of them, and the numbers, and the size, all of that rips the wormhole into existence.
Because they're getting closer.
DOCTOR; No, no, no, look. See the exoskeleton.
They've got bones of metal. They eat metal and extrude it into the exoskeleton. So their velocity makes the wormhole, then their body makes it safe. Perfect design.
Worse it gets, the more I love it.
Ah, good question. What a team. Like she said, why did you crash?
Oh, yes. Gravity well. Look, goes all the way down to the engine. So what happened? He says the drive system stalled. Ten miles up, they fell out of the sky. But what caused that?
Yeah. But wait a minute. That's a crystal nucleus down there, yes? And it looks like it survived the crash. If the crystal's intact? Oh, yes. That's better than diesel.
I think so. The spaceship's a write-off, but the two hundred's small enough.
In a super clever outer-spacey way. Just trust me. There's the crystal! It's fallen to the bottom of the well. Have you got access shafts? All frozen? Well, maybe I can open them. Ah! Internal comms. Put that on.
You stay here. Keep an eye on the shaft. Tell me if anything happens.
If I can use that sunlight to start the automatic maintenance. Christina? If you see a panel opening in that shaft, let me know.
Anything now?
Any sign of movement?
How's that?
Any result?
Why, what do you mean? Christina? Christina!
No!
Come on. Come on, come on, come on. That's better.
You're about to hit the security grid. Look.
Try the big red button.
Now come back up. I can do that.
Slowly.
Quite the mystery, aren't you? Lady Christina de Souza, carrying a winch in her bag.
I had this friend, once. She called me spaceman.
Well, a little blue box. Travels in more than space. It can journey through time, Christina. Oh, the places I've been. World War One. Creation of the universe. End of the universe. The war between China and Japan. And the Court of King Athelstan in 924 AD.
But I don't remember you being there. So what are you doing with this?
It's the Cup of Athelstan, given to the first King of Britain as a coronation gift from Hywel, King of the Welsh. But it's been held in the International Gallery for two hundred years, which makes you, Lady Christina, a thief.
Don't tell me you need the money.
No, no, no, no, no. If you're short of cash, you rob a bank. Stealing this? That's a lifestyle.
Absolutely. Except. That little blue box, I stole it from my own people.
We never did find out why the ship crashed. Christina, I think you should come back up.
Careful. Slowly. Have you got an open-vent system?
I thought so.
It's like when birds fly into the engines of an aircraft.
It got trapped in the vents, caused the crash. Christina, get out.
No, it's dormant because it's so cold down there, but your body heat is raising the temperature.
Not just the crystal. I need the whole bed, the plate thing.
Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. It's going to eat its way up.
Ooo, she's good.
That's it, that's it, that's it. I've got you. I've got you. Isn't she just.
Commander? Mission complete. Now, we've got to get back to the two hundred, all of us. Oh, don't be so daft. A captain can leave his ship, if there's a bus standing by.
Maybe you didn't hit just one of them. If you hit a swarm?
This ship's built inside a metal sleeve. They can move through the infrastructure, all around us. And those things wake up hungry. Commander, you've got to come with us right now.
And that's the word of a lady. Come on.
No, don't.
There's nothing we can do. Run!
Not now, Malcolm!
Get inside. Get them sitting down. Now then, let's have a look.
Oh, nothing. Don't need the crystal.
No, no. You risked your life for these. The clamps.
One there. One there. One there. And one there.
Yeah, something like that. I just need to fix this. Have you got a hammer in that bag?
Phone, phone. Press redial.
Malcolm, it's me.
Ready for what?
But listen, there might be something following us. You need to close the wormhole.
Oh, Malcolm, you're
Brilliant.
Sorry, got to go.
Oh, it's not compatible. Bus, spaceship, spaceship, bus. I need to weld the two systems together.
I need something non-corrosive. Something malleable. Something ductile. Something gold.
Christina, what is it worth now?
I said gold.
Oh, they saw you coming. Christina.
I promise.
This is your driver speaking. Hold on tight.
Come on. That's it. You can do it, you beauty. One last trip.
Anti-gravity clamps. Didn't I say? Round we go.
Only one way to find out. Next stop.
Malcolm, close that wormhole.
He's hung up on me.
Malcolm!
He's hung up again.
Malcolm, listen to me.
I need that signal. We've got billions of those things
About to fly through.
Loop it back through the integrator, and keep the signal ramping up.
Five hundred Bernards. Do it now!
Oh no, you don't.
Do not stand forward of this point. Ladies and gentlemen, you have reached your final destination. Welcome home, the mighty two hundred.
I don't count.
You must be Malcolm.
They'll start again. Generate a new doorway. It's not their fault, it's their natural life cycle. But I'll see if I can nudge the wormholes on to uninhabited planets. Closer to home, Captain. Those two lads. Very good in a crisis. Nathan needs a job, Barclay's good with engines. You could do a lot worse. Privates Nathan and Barclay, UNIT's finest.
Better than a bus, any day. Hello.
Oh, she doesn't mind.
Not a chance.
I hope so.
No.
I said no.
So?
Yeah.
People have travelled with me and I've lost them. Lost them all. Never again.
You too. Chops and gravy, lovely.
What do you mean?
I'd step back, if I were you.
Yes. I'll just step inside this police box and arrest myself.
Christina, we were.

To get into museums?
I've no idea what you're talking about. What, what is Courtney Woods?
Doing what?
Oh, her. Oh, that was ages ago.
Rubbish.
Pffff.
Bah.
Oi! Give over!
What?
Vortex manipulators?
Good. Because I don't like people being sick in my Tardis. No being sick. And no hanky-panky.
Sorry, that's the rules.
Tell her what?
Have you gone bananas?
(sotto) Pfft. God. (normal) How'd you like to be the first woman on the moon? Is that special enough for you?
Okay. Now we can do something interesting.
On a recycled space shuttle. 2049, judging by that prototype version of the Bennett oscillator.
Where's the gravity coming from?
About a hundred nuclear bombs.
Ah. We're on our
Why have you got all these nuclear bombs?
Oh? Well, you're just going to have to shoot us, then. Shoot the little girl first.
Yes. She doesn't want to stand there watching us getting shot, does she? She'll be terrified. Girl first, then her teacher, and then me. You'll have to spend a lot of time shooting me because I will keep on regenerating.
In fact, I'm not entirely sure that I won't keep on regenerating for ever.
Gravity test.So, it'll be very time-consuming and messy, and rather wasteful, because I think I might just possibly be able to help you. You see, I am a super-intelligent alien being who flies in time and space. Are you going to shoot me?
Good. Why have you got all these nuclear bombs? No, no, no. Easier question. What's wrong with my yo-yo?
Bingo.
Ah ha. We should be bouncing about this cabin like little fluffy clouds. But we're not. What is the matter with the moon?
It's put on weight.
Oh, lots of ways. Gravity bombs, axis alignment systems, planet shellers.
Must be causing chaos on Earth. The tides will be so high that they will drown whole cities.
So what are you doing about it?
This?
Is that the best you could get?
How many people here?
Messages? Mayday? SOS?
So then you came up here to rescue them with your bombs?
Nobody came?
You had one.
I could, but it wouldn't make it true.
Maybe something trying to find out how you're put together. Or maybe how you tasted.
Chicken, apparently.
Save the air.
They didn't find anything.
The Mexicans. They didn't find any minerals on the moon at all. Nada.
Oh.
Lines of tectonic stress.
No, no, no. These are much, much bigger. Sea of Tranquillity. Sea of Nectar. Sea of Ingenuity. Sea of Crises.
Meaning, Clara, that the moon, this little planetoid that's been tagging along beside you for a hundred million years, which gives you light at night and seas to sail on, is in the process of falling to bits.
Torch. Give me your torch. Whatever it is, it's in here.
I think we've found your alien.
Back, back, back! We need a door. A door, a door!
Come on, come on! There's no power to work it. Come on!
Stay still. It's sensing movement. It can't see you. Fast movement. There must be another exit through there. Slowly.Slowly.Head to that exit. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly, slowly. (They inch their way.)
Gently, gently. When I say run, run.
Well, you say run, then.
Run! We have power. Run!
You'll be okay!
Courtney, look at me. Look at me! Courtney!
Try and get to the door! Try and get yourself down here.
Courtney, grab my yo-yo!
Courtney!
Good stuff, Courtney. Just don't try that at home, okay?
Did you say germs? Oh, God, this is incredible. Look at the size of it. It's the size of a badger.
It's a prokaryotic unicellular life form, with non-chromosomal DNA. Which, as you and me know. Well, not you and me. Well, you, certainly not. You and me, yes, scientists know, this is a germ. You flew because that one point three billion tonnes shifted. It moved. It's an unstable mass.
Which way to the Mare Fecunditatis?
It was dangerous before. Everything's dangerous if you want it to be. Eating chips is dangerous. Crossing the road. It's no way to live your life. Tell her. You're supposed to be teaching her.
Course I know what a duty of care is. What are you suggesting? She's fine. What are you, thirty five?
Now, don't touch anything.
Oh, don't be so stupid!
Get in.
Eh?
How do you know?
Maybe it isn't the moon. Maybe it's a hologram or a big painting, or a special effect. Maybe it's a completely different moon.
I would?
Clara, there are some moments in time that I simply can't see. Little eye-blinks. They don't look the same as other things. They're not clear. They're fuzzy, they're grey. Little moments in which big things are decided. And this is one of them. Just now, I can't tell what happens to the moon, because whatever happens to the moon hasn't been decided yet. And it's going to be decided here and now. Which very much sounds as though it's up to us.
Decision made.
What is killing the moon?
Everything does, sooner or later.
Depends what's killing it.
Well, I've only seen one of them. It would take an awful lot more to cause the moon to put on one point three billion tonnes.
Argh!
Well, that makes two.
Shine your light down there.
Maybe they've been there all the time. It's warmish. They're multiplying, feeding, evolving.
I agree. Unless something else is going on.
It's not water. It's amniotic fluid. The stuff that life comes from. I've got to go down there.
Back to your shuttle. Get your bombs ready. You, get to the Tardis. Get safe. Get Courtney safe. I will be back.
Today's the day, humankind.
She's in the shuttle, isn't she? She'll turn up.
You two have never gotten on, have you?
Courtney is safe. Och. Well, do you have her phone number?
Well, what about the school? Does the secretary have her number?
Phone. I know what the problem is. Oh, she can't post that. She can't put pictures of me online.
You can't put pictures of me online.
Yes, yes. It's a rather big problem.
Well, I had a little hypothesis. The seismic activity, the surface breaking up, the variable mass, the increase in gravity, the fluid. I scanned what's down there.
The moon isn't breaking apart. Well, actually, it is breaking apart, and rather quickly. We've got about an hour and a half. But that isn't the problem. It's not infested.
Bacteria. Tiny, tiny bacteria living on something very, very big. Something that weighs about one point three billion tonnes. Something that's living. Something growing.
That.
No.
That doesn't live under the moon. That
The moon isn't breaking apart. The moon is hatching.
The moon's an egg.
Yes, for a hundred million years or so. Just, just growing. Just getting ready to be born.
No, no, no, no. It's never been dead. It's just taking a long time to come alive.
No!
Courtney, don't spoil the moment.
I think that it's unique. I think that's the only one of its kind in the universe. I think that that is utterly beautiful.
Kill the moon?
Kill the moon. Well, you have about a hundred of the best man-made nuclear weapons, if they still work. If that's what you want to do.
A hundred nuclear bombs set off right where we are, right on top of a living, vulnerable creature? It'll never feel the sun on its back.
Well, there'll be nothing to make it break up. There will be nothing trying to force its way out. The gravity of the little dead baby will pull all the pieces back together again. Of course, it won't be very pretty. You'd have an enormous corpse floating in the sky. You might have some very difficult conversations to have with your kids.
Ah, there's some DVDs on the blue book shelf.

And make sure you hang on to the console, otherwise the Tardis will leave you behind.
Nothing.

The Earth isn't my home. The moon's not my moon. Sorry.
Listen, there are moments in every civilisation's history in which the whole path of that civilisation is decided. The whole future path. Whatever future humanity might have depends upon the choice that is made right here and right now. Now, you've got the tools to kill it. You made them. You brought them up here all on your own, with your own ingenuity. You don't need a Time Lord. Kill it. Or let it live. I can't make this decision for you.
Well, there's two of you here.
Who's better qualified?
Oh, take something off his plate. He makes far too many decisions anyway.
She. Sorry. She hasn't even been into space. She hasn't been to another planet. How would she even know what to do?
Listen, we went to dinner in Berlin in 1937, right? We didn't nip out after pudding and kill Hitler. I've never killed Hitler. And you wouldn't expect me to kill Hitler. The future is no more malleable than the past.
Sorry. Well, actually, no, I'm not sorry. It's time to take the stabilisers off your bike. It's your moon, womankind. It's your choice.
Absolutely not.
A teenager, an astronaut and a schoolteacher.
No. Some decisions are too important not to make on your own.
One, two, three, into the Tardis.
Let's go and have a look, shall we?
Mind your language, please, There are children present.
Nobody's going to die.
It's feeling the sun on itself. It's getting warm. The chick flies away and the eggshell disintegrates. Harmless.
You made your decision. Humanity made its choice.
Well, there you go.
In the mid-twenty first century humankind starts creeping off into the stars, spreads its way through the galaxy to the very edges of the universe. And it endures till the end of time.
And it does all that because one day in the year 2049, when it had stopped thinking about going to the stars, something occurred that make it look up, not down. It looked out there into the blackness and it saw something beautiful, something wonderful, that for once it didn't want to destroy. And in that one moment, the whole course of history was changed. Not bad for a girl from Coal Hill School, and her teacher.
That's what we call a new moon.
I think that somebody deserves a thank you.
Okay, Captain. Well, you've got a whole new space programme to get together. NASA is er, it's that way. About two and a half thousand miles. (to Courtney) You still got your vortex manipulators? I'll give you a run home.
Not that it's any of my business, but I think you did the right thing.
Nothing. I told you, I've got grey areas.
I knew that eggs are not bombs. I know they don't usually destroy their nests. Essentially, what I knew was that you would always make the best choice. I had faith that you would always make the right choice.
It wasn't my decision to make. I told you.
Well, she really is something special now, isn't she? First woman on the moon, saved the Earth from itself, and, rather bizarrely, she becomes the President of the United States. She met this bloke called Blinovitch
Well, I didn't do it for Courtney. I didn't know what was going to happen. Do you think I'm lying?
No, that was me allowing you to make a choice about your own future. That was me respecting you.
Right. Okay. Er.
Language.
I was helping.
Yes.
Clara. Clara.

And that weird munchkin lady with the big eyes? Do you remember? the way she looked at you! And then she opens her mouth and fire comes out!
Yeah. One minute she's standing there, and the next minute roar!
Oh, it was on this er, this er planet thing. Asteroid. It's a long story, you had to be there. Er, what're you doing that for?
When was that?
Er, you can let go now.
Ten minutes? Twenty? Twenty nine?
No, no, no. I was just, I was, I was calibrating. I was just. No, I know exactly what I'm doing.
The time vortex is gone. That's impossible. It's just gone. Brace yourself! We're going to crash!
Everyone all right? Rose? Mickey?
She's dead. The Tardis is dead.
There's nothing to fix. She's perished. The last Tardis in the universe. Extinct.
Where from?
We fell out of the vortex, through the void, into nothingness. We're in some sort of no place. The silent realm. The lost dimension.
So this is London.
Your city.
Just as we left it.
And that includes the Zeppelins?
This is not your world.
Must be.
Don't look at it, Rose. Don't even think about it. This is not your world.
Rose, if you've ever trusted me, then listen to me now. Stop looking at it. Your father's dead. He died when you were six months old. That is not your Pete. That is a Pete. For all we know, he's got his own Jackie, his own Rose. His own daughter who is someone else, but not you. You can't see him. Not ever.
I told you to keep an eye on her.
She goes wandering off. Parallel world, it's like a gingerbread house. All those temptations calling out.
Well, I don't know, I can't worry about everything. If I could just get this thing to
Yes.
Yes. Ow.
We're not meant to be here. The Tardis draws it's power from the universe, but it's the wrong universe. It's like diesel in a petrol engine.
Not in the real world. It used to be easy. When the Time Lords kept their eye on everything, you could hop between realities, home in time for tea. Then they died, and took it all with them. The walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less kind.
I don't know. Accident? Should've been impossible. Now we're trapped. What's that?
That, there. Is that a reflection? It's a light! Is it? Is that a light? I think that's a light. That's all we need. We've got power! Mickey, we've got power! Ha!
It's alive!
It's nothing. It's tiny. One of those insignificant little power cells that no one ever bothers about, and it's clinging onto life, with one little ounce of reality tucked away inside.
Not yet. I need to charge it up.
Wrong sort of energy. It's got to come from our universe.
There's me.
I just gave away ten years of my life. Worth every second.
It's on a recharging cycle. It'll loop round, power back up and be ready to take us home in, oo, twenty four hours?
Shore leave. As long as we keep our heads down. Easy. No problem. Let's go and tell her.
There you are. You all right? No applause. I fixed it. Twenty four hours, then we're flying back to reality. What is it?
Rose, whatever it says, this is the wrong world.
What do you mean?
Give me that phone.
You can't.
I can't let you.
You can't become their daughter, that's not the way it works. Mickey, tell her.
Where're you going?
Stay where you are, both of you. Rose, come back here! Mickey, come back here right now!
Like what?
Back here, twenty four hours!
I never knew.
You never said.
Could be. Like I said, parallel world, gingerbread house. We need to get out of here as fast as we can.
They've stopped.
It's the earpieces. Like Bluetooth attachments, but everyone's connected together.
They get it direct. Downloaded right into their heads.
Everyone shares the same information. A daily download published by Cybus Industries.
You lot, you're obsessed. You'd do anything for the latest upgrade.
It's not so far off your world. This place is only parallel. Oh, look at that. Cybus Industries, owners of just about every company in Britain, including Vitex. Mister Pete Tyler's very well connected. Oh, okay. I give up. Let's go and see him.
They've got visitors.
Well, given Pete Tyler's guest list, I wouldn't mind a look. And there is one guaranteed way of getting inside.
Who do you want to be?
Got us in, didn't it?
If you want to know what's going on, work in the kitchens. According to Lucy, that man over there
She's carrying the salmon pinwheels.
Yeah. Lucy says, that is the President of Great Britain.
Seems so.
You can't stay. Even if there was some way of telling them.
She's got you. Those two haven't. All these different worlds, not one of them gets it right.
Sorry.
Cybers.
It's happening again.
I've seem them before.
Cybermen.
Worse than that.
They were, until they had all their humanity taken away. That's a living brain jammed inside a cybernetic body, with a heart of steel. All emotions removed.
Because it hurts.
Into what?
Don't.
I'm telling you, don't.
There's nothing we can do.
She is not your mother! Come on!
Pete, is there a way out?
You wouldn't believe it in a million years.
Oh, as if things weren't bad enough, there's two Mickey's.
Put the guns down. Bullets won't stop them.
No! Stop shooting, now. We surrender! Hands up. There's no need to damage us. We're good stock. We volunteer for the upgrade program. Take us to be processed.
But we surrender.
But this is a surrender.
But we're surrendering! Listen to me, we surrender!

Atrios? Do you know, I've never actually been to Atrios.
Where?
Yes, but we're not going to Zeos.
Well why don't you get on with it then?
Atrios, K9. Atrios. I wonder what the inhabitants are like there?
There. We should be in parking orbit over Atrios. Let's see where we're going, shall we?
That's odd. That's very odd. Wouldn't you say that was very odd?
I wonder what went wrong?
Zero zero six nine. That's exactly what you gave me. Are you sure?
No, no, no, just a minute. There may have been a time shift. Let's take another reading.
Zero zero eight zero one zero. What a lot of zeroes. There it is!
Well. Well, it's something, anyway.
Yes.
Do you know what I think? I think something's gone wrong. Something fairly serious.
Well, it could be a coincidence.
No, nor would I. There's only one thing to do.
I think I'll take us in on manual, with circumspection.
What's the matter?
Good heavens. You could fry eggs in the street.
What?
Not at all, no.
I don't know. Probably someone giving a huge breakfast party. Think positive. Why do you always assume the worst?
Empirical poppycock. Where's your joy in life? Where's your optimism?
Oh do shut up, K9. Listen, Romana. Whenever you go into a new situation you must always believe the best until you find out exactly what the situation's all about, then believe the worst.
Don't be ridiculous, it always is. Isn't it, K9?
Still, nuclear war. It's always difficult walking into these situations. You never know who's fighting who.
Oh, I think I can say why.
Why? Why, it's got to be, hasn't it? It's got to be something to do with the sixth and most important segment of the Key to Time, hmm?
A welcoming party, do you think? K9? K9, what do you make of that?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. We'll dematerialise at the last moment. Let whoever's shooting at us think they've hit us. Always confuse the enemy.
Right, link that tracer in. I want to land as close as possible to the sixth segment. The less time we spend on Atrios, the better.
Standing by? K9, how long to impact?
What?
No, no, don't say it, please.
Don't say another underground passage.
Yes. K9? K9, are you still sulking in there? Come on out. No water or swamps. It's quite safe.
I don't know. What did you say?
Four hundred metres? They are taking a pasting. If it's like this down here, imagine what it's like on the surface.
You're right, K9. He hasn't been dead. Shot, poor chap.
Yeah. Must have been one of his friends. Just goes to show, you can't trust anyone nowadays.
No. Let's locate the sixth segment and get out of here.
Locked and lead. What does that suggest to you?
Any sentient life through there, K9?
Yes, it's well guarded, or at least it was. Perhaps the door's booby-trapped.
What?
Yes. What? Will you come into my parlour said the spider to the fly?
I think we should tread very carefully. K9?
Could you make a hole for me in that door, K9? A little, little hole, K9. We don't know what's beyond there, do we.
That's enough, K9, that's enough. Back up.
Romana, there's a
There's a man standing behind you. Get your hands up.
We're travellers. We seem to be lost, actually. He's dead.
No. Yes.
I've told you. We were trying to avoid the bombardment. I thought that door might lead to the way out.
What? He saved our lives.
Spies? Do we look like spies?
I though spies looked kind of inconspicuous.
I told you, we're not even armed. Look, nothing, just a whistle. Care for a blow? Go on.
Tourism.
Yes, well, I run this small agency, you see. Trips to battlefields future and past. How civilisations died. It's very profitable. Isn't it very profitable, Romana?
Looking for a key.
Beautifully put, I thought.
I'm sorry, I don't think we can help you.
No.
No, I sincerely hope not, but I think we've been here long enough.
Listen, we tell you the truth and you don't believe us. You accuse us of crimes we haven't committed, and now you're going to have us shot. I think after a long journey that's a bit too much, Marshal. K9, lights!
Goodbye, Marshal. Come on.
Come on, run.
Back to the Tardis.
What?
Yes, buried under that rubble.
There's always a way out, if only we can find it.
Possibly, possibly. K9's watching our rear.
Oh, it's you.
Just a minute, just a minute. Why do you want to know?
Ah. Oh. Oh, well, just before the Marshal arrested us, I did find somebody, and judging from the voice it was certainly a young woman.
She was through there.
No, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'll take a look.
I can't see anything. K9, any sign of our pursuers?
Good. Now listen, K9. K9, we want this door open, but be careful. There may be someone on the other side.
Come on.
No, no, no, of course not, but we're friendly. Don't worry about that. Romana?
Keep an eye out round the corner. Come here, Merak.
Why would the Marshal want to get rid of Astra?
Too many coincidences. Well?
Of course.
Yes. Is there any other reason why the Marshal would want to get rid of her?
Good. Romana? Ready?
Anything?
Yes.
Merak, Merak. People aren't dissolved by radiation. You're a surgeon. You should know that. If she's not here, she must be somewhere else.
K9. K9, keep an eye on that wall.
Merak, do you know if there's anything behind that room?
What?
They could have moved her while we were with the Marshal. They moved the guard's body. On the other hand.
Well, on the other hand, anything's possible. Well almost. Merak, a recycling shaft? Recycling what, exactly?
Oh, just general interest. Come on, let's go.
Well, if there's no way out there's only one thing to do.
DOCTOR; Go back the way we came. I'd like to find out what that Marshal's really up to. Come on.
Come on!
Where are we going?
That's funny, I want to see the Marshal. Come on, let's move.
So nice of you to invite us back.
Listen, I don't think we've been properly introduced. I'm the Doctor. Who are you?
Ah, Marshal. I understand you've got a few problems and I was thinking that if you and I got together we, er, Marshal? Marshal? Is he all right?
What? Does he do it often?
No wonder thing's aren't going well. Standing in front of a mirror gimbling and smiling at himself like that is the first sign of megalomania. He's not a ventriloquist, is he?
A ventriloquist. A chap who throws his voice, you know. Throws his voice. Has a dummy. Operates a dummy. A dummy. A dummy. A dummy, of course!
Ah, Marshal.
Friend? The last time I came here, you wanted to shoot me.
Ah, well, fancy you mistaking me for a Zeon. Really, Marshal.
Forgotten?
We had? You mean that we were expected?
Yes, I understand how you feel, Marshal.
I am. Am I?
Oh, good-o. As long as there's no personal risk involved, of course.
This blessed plot.
Yes! No, I prefer the original.
Yes. But listen, before I do, what happens if I don't?
Oh well, I'm very grateful for your confidence, Marshal. I'll see what I can manage. Er, we're not under arrest, then?
Listen, I shall need to know the situation. The basic situation.
Me?
Six ships? Is that it? The mighty battlefleet of Atrios?
Why?
Yes, I think so.
Peace.
Tell me, Marshal. If you had this ultimate deterrent, what would you do?
Yes, well, you have a true military mind, Marshal.
I'll tell you what I'll do. You help me find the S, you help me find the Princess Astra and I'll knock you up a deterrent. How's that?
Oh yes, I think I can do something for you.
Oh, it will be, it will be. A sort of parasol affair.
Well, a sort of umbrella forcefield, you know, that no Zeon ship can penetrate.
Well, not quite. I mean, they can't get in but you can't get out.
Well, I mean
Well, there's always a snag, I mean, but I'll work on it. Look, I'll need K9.
Yes, my computer. The one you thought was a weapon.
Furnace? What furnace?
Scrap! Where is this furnace? Where is this furnace?
Warm for the time of the year. It's a little trick I picked up from the fire-walkers in Bali. They do it all the time. Come on, old boy.
Oh, that's all right. We all make mistakes sometimes, don't we, K9?
Yes, now listen, Marshal. If you're going to insist we do this your way
I thought you might. Now listen. If we're going to set up a one-way forcefield, one that keeps the Zeons out but allows you to pass through it to attack them, we're going to have to get to know our enemy, so to speak.
I was thinking in terms of a psychological barrier. It's cheap, efficient and energy saving, and it would stop the Zeons wanting to come here. Introduce an element of iatrophobia?
Yes, but to that I'd have to meet one, you see, get to know it. Brain patterns, that sort of thing. Isn't that right, Romana?
Now, Marshal, can you arrange that?
Look, it doesn't have to be anything particularly intelligent. Any prisoner would do.
Well, if you can't find me a Zeon, I'll have to think of something else.
Quite, quite, Marshal. Marshal, would you excuse us please?
Thank you.
He did? How very considerate of him.
What?
What, a device of some sort? Something you weren't meant to see?
A control device?
Yes, and what's behind that mirror he's so fond of looking at?
Merak, I believe we're closer to finding Princess Astra than we realise. What worries me is, are we supposed to?
Who's pulling the wool over who's eyes? Are we supposed to fall for the Marshal's bluff or is he supposed to fall for our?
It wouldn't make any difference. Even if I told you, you couldn't reach her.
Because I think that Astra's on Zeos.
Zeos is there all right, it's just you can't see it.
Can you see me now?
Why not?
Right.
Because it's absorbing the light or energy. Or else it's camouflaged.
No, no, no. Maybe it's large, or perhaps its small.
How could Columbus be so sure.
Never mind about that.
Behind that mirror over there. There's bound to be another entrance. You and Romana go over there and see what you can find.
Here.
No, no, no, no. I've worked it all out.
The problem is energy. If we're using energy to neutralise mass, which is all a forcefield is, we need enough energy or power erg-wise to counteract the Zeon bombardment mass-wise
It won't work. Look, K9's worked it all out.
Which rather defeats the purpose.
Because you wouldn't have a planet to live on.
No, no, not quite, not quite. You remember I mentioned a psychological barrier, a deterrent that no Zeon would cross?
No, I think I said examine.
There are on Zeos.
I go to Zeos, pick up a Zeon, and bring the Princess Astra back if she's there.
Yes, it'll give you time to save your neck.
Well?
You know, K9, I've got a feeling we're missing out on something. Are you listening to me, K9?
Listen. Why should the Marshal, leader in a war against Zeos, be the only one to know of a transmatter link with the enemy planet? And why should he tell me? I think one of us is being extremely stupid.
Come on.
Well, good luck, K9. I hope to see you again soon.
Shush. K9, can I take the decisions, please? Good luck. I'll see you again soon.
A trap?
Really? Do you mean because of that?
Yes. Yes, I hear you. Who are you?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
I don't know.
Lost. Lost!
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, you mean the Tardis? Yes, yes, I expected to find that here. Correct me if I'm wrong. This is Zeos, isn't it?
And we came up in the transmat shaft, and then, as they say, everything went black.
Certainly. Interested in timepieces, are you? Chronostatics, horogenesis, that sort of thing?
Oh yes, I am. I'm sorry to disillusion you, whoever you are. And you tried breaking and entry into my Tardis, didn't you, and failed. Covered with automatic defence mechanisms. Very clever, really.
Well, if you do that, you'll never get them will you. And if you let me go in there, there's no guarantee that I'll come out, is there. It's bigger that it looks, you know. I take it you have the sixth segment.
Hold it! There must be some civilised solution to all this without this continued use of brute force.
Look, I'd really like to help you, but I've got a problem. You see, the thing is, the segments are in there and of course I can go in there, but I can't bring them out here.
Well, you see, I've built a fail-safe. The segments are in a sort of limbo closet in, er, in limbo, and the only way to get at them, you see, is with the next piece, so if you'll just let me have it I'll pop in there and fetch them for you.
No. And I certainly don't trust you. Bit of an impasse, eh?
That's right. Fools rush in.
No. I think I'll have a little look round first, for the sixth segment.
Romana. Merak. K9.
I'm not armed, you know.
Well, through the transmat, I imagine.
Yes.
Shapp, we're on Zeos.
Yes. You were transmatted up the transmatter there. Look. Transmat.
Shapp, old chap, we're on Zeos.
All right, if we're on Atrios, where's the destruction? Look, not a crack. Everything perfect.
On Zeos! Where the Zeons come from. But there don't seem to be many of them about, which is quite good for us.
There must be some evidence this way. Anyway, it's time I found the other two.
Come on. I'll tell you about the theory of particle transmission.
Yes.
Maybe the Zeons don't use it much.
How do you know?
Yes, except K9. Here.
Have you ever seen a Zeon, Shapp?
No, but before the war?
What do they look like?
They're not tall, emaciated creatures in long black robes?
No.
Why? Well, the ones who brought me here were. Very sinister.
Yes, but there's no sign of your attacks getting through, though, is there?
Isn't it odd you've never taken any prisoners?
Yes, I
K9, what took you so long?
Really? We'd like to meet this commandant, wouldn't we, Shapp?
Good.
Well, I mean, I think you'd better trace Romana and Merak first.
Good.
Yes.
Well, you know, form, condition, tone.
What did you just say? With something other?
Well, I'd say it's been in touch with the sixth segment, wouldn't you?
I don't know. I've never seen him do that before. That doesn't mean to say, of course, it isn't normal.
Insects! With stings in their tails.
Come on, Romana. You two stay there.
Shapp!
There's your enemy, Shapp. Runs everything. Attack, defence, surveillance, production, everything. The ideal war general. No glory, no speeches, no medals and no blood.
It's fully automated. There are no Zeons on Zeos.
No. Just this passionless lump of minerals and circuitry. Highly efficient, doing very well, giving Atrios a battering, killed millions without a flicker. Just doing its job. And totally invincible.
It's all right, Merak. Be quiet. K9, would you ask your friend here
K9, would you ask Mentalis here if the name Astra rings a bell, so to speak?
And the war?
For whom?
We have a problem. Well, several problems. Mentalis knows, but won't tell, about Astra. Refuses us access to the memory banks but tells us that the Marshal's on his way here to blow this place to smithereens.
Unfortunately, it's been programmed that the war is over, so it can't attack. It thinks it's won. That's the trouble with machines.
Well, it will self-destruct. I think obliteration was the term it used.
There will be a rather large bang, big enough to blow up Zeos, take Atrios with it, and make certain the whole thing ends in a sort of draw. That's the way these military minds work. The Armageddon factor.
Has it ever occurred to you, Shapp, that you and the Marshal and this thing are in an arena, playing out a game for some evil alien spectator?
Yes. I think I've met him. Calls himself the Shadow.
Well, we're going to try and neutralise and dismantle Mentalis here, and it's absolutely essential that while I'm fiddling it doesn't have to be distracted by an attack from the Marshal. Now listen, I want you two to go back to Atrios via the transmat. You, Shapp, are to contact the Marshal. Tell him he's won. Tell him the war's over. Tell him anything you like but stop him taking any further action.
Well, then Mentalis
Then Mentalis will
Well, then Mentalis will go into it's Armageddon sequence, we'll be bits of dust flying round the cosmos, including the Marshal. You might even tell him that. What are you waiting for?
K9, are you sure this is all right?
I mean, it doesn't feel threatened or anything?
Yes?
Oh, more than likely, yeah.
More than likely. The question is, where?
Romana, that's brilliant. Of course! He's got a third planet all to himself.
After I've stopped this.
What?
I don't know. K9, what have I done?
Blast.
Let's hope Shapp reaches the Marshal before he does anything silly. We're very vulnerable till that's done.
What's that, K9? Well?
Sorry. Well?
The Marshal. Shapp must have missed him.
Yes, and us with it. Unless.
That was close.
They weren't aiming at me, they were aiming at that, the control centre, like a scorpion stinging itself to death. As soon as it sensed I was trying to interfere with the sequence, it destroyed its own control centre. It's mindless now, clicking toward oblivion. How long, K9?
The Tardis!
Here, take a look at this.
Have you got the tracer?
Lock it in. Lock it.
Well, it was just an idea. I thought if we had five-sixths of the pieces it might give us some power. Obviously Guardian technology doesn't work that way.
Yeah. Or a sixth piece.
What do you see there?
Exactly. A gap the shape of the sixth piece.
We know what it looks like. We can make one.
Here we are.
Chronodyne.
Well, it's as compatible as anything we've got.
Yes, and so are we if this doesn't work. This should in theory give us powers of balance and stasis. We should be able to create a neutral, timeless zone, for a while. Now, how does it go?
Lock it, lock it.
Have we?
Well, ninety nine percent.
Even better. We haven't stopped them dead. We got them in a three second time loop. Oh!
I've stopped the universe. Still, they'll never notice. Just imagine, somewhere someone's just slipped on a banana skin and he'll be wondering forever when he's going to hit the ground.
Oh, come on, Romana! I mean, if it affected the operators, no one would be able to use it. Even the Guardians would think of that.
Yes. Yes, it's quite a feeling, isn't it. Gods for an hour or two.
Well of course it is. Just imagine the amount of power required to stop the entire universe.
Probability, then.
Three and a quarter minutes?
Yes. How do you set about localising a time loop?
Eh?
Oh, yes. Yeah. Stand aside. I. Hey, I'd better get this right.
I command that the spatio-temporal loop be confined to the vicinity of the Marshal's vessel, the coordinates of which are already known. There.
And the Zeon computer room. Let it be done. I thought I handled that rather well.
Oh, come on. It's only a three second time loop.
Already? How much?
And the chronodyne chip?
Yes, I thought you'd say that.
Yes. Nothing lasts forever.
Come on, quickly. Remember that time loop's stretching.
Was she, now. How do you do? I'm delighted to see you. I'm the Doctor, this is Romana.
So you rescued her from the Zeons?
How did you manage that?
Very likely, very likely. Where are they now?
Good, good.
Yes. Look, Astra, why don't you and Merak go back to Atrios via the transmat? He'll show you the way.
Well, I dare say, but we've got a few complicated things to do and Merak does need attention. I think the thing you should do is go back and show your people that you're free.
Of course I'm right. Off you go now. Hope to see you soon.
Odd.
I think we should concentrate on the Shadow and the third planet.
K9? K9?
Yes. Something must have happened.
Yes, what is it? What is it? Quick into the Tardis. Key?
All right, all right.
Where's Merak? Is he all right?
Good.
Yes. That gives us about an hour of real time.
It's a pretty little thing, isn't it.
It's the Key to Time. Are you all right, Astra?
Well, now you've seen it, does it trigger off any hidden memories?
That's a pity. I was hoping you'd be able to tell us where the sixth piece is.
Yes. Look. We have the other five segments. Now we're looking for the sixth and final one. Think, Astra, think.
I wouldn't touch it. It's hot.
Good, good. Set the coordinates. Let's get on our way.
Well, here we are. We've tracked him to his lair.
All we have to do is find the sixth piece and stop the Shadow taking those other five.
Diagonal thinking, that's what's required, isn't it, Astra?
Astra, we need you to help us to find the Shadow.
No, no, Astra, no. You're the only one who's ever been to the third planet before. Come on.
Yes, yes, everything's perfectly all right. Everything's wonderful, isn't it, Astra?
Go on. I'll catch you up.
Intergalactic computer distress signal? How very odd. How strange. Here? K9.
Two six zero. (beep) Ah.
Ah, girls.
Shush. I think someone's trying to play tricks on us. You girls better stick with me, or we'll all get lost. I
Ah, I see what you're at, splitting us up. Divide and conquer, is that it? You didn't really imagine we were taken in by Astra, did you?
No. She's in your power, your employ. Little something on the neck, is it? Very crude, technically.
Like all this amusement arcade rubbish.
No, Shadow, or whatever you're called. I'm sorry to tell you
That Romana can look after herself. We are Time Lords
Not like those innocents back on Atrios, you know. Time Lords sent by the Guardian to recover the Key to Time.
No, no, no! No!
What?
Drax?
Not
Drax.
Yes, Gallifrey. Of course! Ha, ha! Drax.
Yeah.
What happened to you?
Yeah. What sort of things?
Armaments?
Drax, I was introduced to a computer on Zeos. Called itself Mentalis. Did you by any chance have anything to do with the installation?
The Shadow?
Yes, very tricky.
Did you make that?
You made this here?
Drax, I don't want to pry, but where did you acquire this peculiar vocabulary?
Brixton?
I've been to Earth.
No, no. It's very colourful. Very demotic.
Doctor.
No offence.
Drax?
Drax?
That hole in the wall?
Might that, might it lead to a way out?
Find what?
Yes, but where does it lead?
Aren't they stabiliser components?
But you said your Tardis was parked on Zeos.
How long have you been here?
Five years? For five years you've had a dimensional stabiliser virtually intact and you haven't managed to escape?
Oh, come on, Drax! You could have repaired that and long-dogged it out of here years ago.
Aren't you?
Yes, you would. What's he offered you?
Are you about to suggest that you and I make a run for it out of here in my Tardis?
Oh yes, it's a very good idea, you and me in my Tardis. And what happens then when we're inside, eh? Sock full of sand, lead pipe and you away with the Key to Time, am I right, Drax?
If you had, do you think he'd let you get away? You'd be in for the chop, too.
Of course you would. So why don't you help me? I mean, together we stand a slight chance. And after all, we are Time Lords, you and I. Class of ninety two. If we don't stick together, who will?
Try synaptic adhesion.
I think it's synaptic adhesion.
All right. Got to be synaptic adhesion. All right, all right, I'll leave it to you, shall I.
Drax, where does this lead?
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Doctor?
Yes, old friend?
I can't hear. Can you come a bit closer?
Oh, K9.
Ah.
Tell your master I shall give his offer serious consideration.
Yes?
That's my computer.
Drax, I've got no time to explain. Remove the control device from under his chin, all right?
Now nothing. Carry on with the stabiliser. I'll be back soon, I hope. Bye.
I refuse to negotiate in an atmosphere of threat.
No, no, stop! Stop!
Well of course it matters. You have the sixth piece, I take it?
Well, I'd like to see it, if it's possible.
Ah. Yes. If I bring the other five pieces
What is it you have in mind? I mean, what do you intend to do?
Yes. I suppose you realise I've rigged things so that Atrios and Zeos are protected.
Yes, my puny. Well, it may be puny but it works. If you break that, millions of people will die.
Our?
Oh.
Very well.
I suppose you realise that once I give the Shadow the Key to Time, that you and your colleagues will be superfluous.
What I mean was that, you see, after I've given the Shadow the Key to Time, he'll kill you and then he'll kill me, and perhaps you don't care.
No, Drax, no. No!
You shrank the wrong man, Drax.
Why didn't you shrink the mute? The Tardis door's open.
Like putty.
Yes. The door's open so the Shadow can go in there and take the Key to Time. Romana can't help and the time loop must be at breaking point by now.
When the countdown reaches zero, up goes Atrios, Zeos and all.
Yes, you might say that. And of course there's the Marshal.
No.
He's in the time loop as well, making a rocket attack on Zeos. Unless, of course, Shapp and Merak get in contact with him.
Back on Atrios, I hope.
Oh?
Mobility.
Yes. If the Shadow gets the five pieces from the Tardis, which he undoubtedly will, it's up to us to get the sixth piece.
The Shadow said I'd already seen it. It must be Astra.
She must have it. Let's see where this crack leads, shall we?
What? You mean there's a way in he doesn't know about?
No. No, no. no. But if we get K9 up there, we won't need a pick and shovel, will we. We can still give the Shadow a surprise.
No, no, Drax, no. Small is lovely.
Everything all right, K9?
Control box in position?
Batteries charged?
Test the blaster, K9.
Blaster working, K9?
You all right, Drax?
I'd sit somewhere else, if I were you. Ready, K9?
Now remember, it's absolutely vital to convince the Shadow that you're still under his control. This whole plan depends on how well you can act. Got it?
Keep it simple, K9.
Okay, K9. Now forward. You're on.
Did you ever get to Troy, Drax? Little place in Asia Minor.
The stabiliser, Drax, now!
Quick, back to the Tardis! Quick!
How will you get back?
Good.
Come on, Romana. Merak, get inside!
Quick, get inside, man!
What!
No, Romana, come on.
Set the coordinates for Zeos.
Romana, it wasn't our idea to use the Royal House of Atrios as carriers, was it?
I don't like it any more than you do, but it's done. Have you set those coordinates yet?
Well, you could start by setting the coordinates for Zeos.
Romana, you get carried away. If you don't set those coordinates, millions of people will die and this time it really will be our fault. Have you forgotten the time loop?
In less than a second?
Quick, cutters. Cutters!
Listen, Drax. Drax, don't just stand there. What colour?
What?
Drax!
Drax!
Drax!
Drax. You took your time. Where's K9?
Really. How is he?
Yes.
I don't think so.
What? The Marshal.
Quick!
What a shot, Marshal! Ha, ha, well shot!
Well, I can't help what he was aiming at.
A mere nothing. A mere deflective forcefield set up for a millisecond set up between the Marshal and Zeos, bounced the missiles smack onto the planet of evil.
Yes.
Well, I'm sorry about that. I don't know what I'm apologising for. I just saved your lives! Can I drop you somewhere, Drax?
Contract job? No armaments, I hope.
When did you arrange this?
I see. Fifty-fifty?
Ah.
I'll let you know. Bye, bye, Drax.
Bye, bye, Drax.
Why Gallifrey?
We have the power to do anything we like. Absolute power over every particle in the universe. Everything that has ever existed or ever will exist. As from this moment are you listening to me, Romana?
Because if you're not listening I can make you listen, because I can do anything.
As from this moment there's no such thing as free will in the entire universe. There's only my will, because I possess the Key to Time!
(normal) Well of course I'm all right. But supposing I wasn't all right. This thing makes me feel in such a way I'd be very worried if I felt like that about someone else feeling like this about that. Do you understand?
What do you understand?
Oh, thank you, sir, thank you.
Well, it was a pleasure, sir. Wasn't it a pleasure, Romana?
What's the President got to do with it?
Just be careful who you're talking to.
Ah. Oh, I have, I have indeed, sir. Do you like it?
Yes, we're very proud of it, sir. Aren't we, Romana, proud of it?
What happens now, sir? You said, if I remember in our first conversation, that once it was assembled it would stop the entire universe and enable you to restore the natural balances of good and evil throughout the whole of the universe.
Certainly, sir, yes, certainly, of course. Key to Time, I command you. Could I ask you something, sir?
It's just that, well, the Key is already assembled, sir. I mean, couldn't you restore the balances now?
Oh yes, sir, yes, and mustn't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands. I quite understand, sir, yes. Key to Time, I command. What about the sixth segment?
Well, I mean, as you know, sir, the sixth segment was in fact a human being, and I mean, if the pieces are maintained in their present pattern it means that she'll be imprisoned forever, sir.
Very regrettable.
Quite. You can't be too careful. I quite understand. Key to Time, I command that you stay exactly where you are!
We can't be too careful, can we? And it would be a terrible tragedy for the universe if it suddenly turned out that I was colour blind.
Unable to distinguish between the White Guardian and the Black Guardian.
Look.
Don't you see? The White Guardian would never have had such a callous disregard for human life.
I think not. Remember, the Key to Time is still mine, rage all you like.
Ah well, I wish I could stay and watch you try, but you know how it is. Places to go, people to see, things to do. Romana?
When I give the signal
Dematerialise.
Now!
You see? I think of everything.
Hmm?
Key to Time? Oh, well, I just scattered it round through space and time.
Going? I don't know.
What?
Exactly.
Well, if I knew where I was going, there'd be a chance the Black Guardian would, too.
Hence this new device.
Well, it's called a randomiser and it's fitted to the guidance system and operates under a very complex scientific principle called pot luck.
Now no one knows where we're going. Not even the Black Guardian.

Well, it looks like it, Zoe. Come on.
Barbed wire, Jamie. It's filthy stuff. I thought so.
We're back in history, Jamie. One of the most terrible times on the planet Earth.
Quick! Down there!
Jamie!
Well, yes, I think so.
What?
Oh. Oh my. Oh.
Well, where are we?
Now, just be quiet, Jamie, and let me do the talking.
Yes. I'm afraid that we've landed up in the middle of one of the worst wars in human history.
Well, it's trench warfare, you see, Jamie. These trenches stretch right the way across the continent of Europe.
Well, I well I believe that they call it The War to End Wars.
Well, they've got no reason to keep us. Here, things have calmed down a bit. Let's try and get away.
Oh!
Our transportation is over there, you see. We're trying to get to it.
Oh, we don't want to bother him. I'm sure he's very busy.
Trying not to get killed.
Er, look, Major, we don't want to trouble you. If you'd just let us go on our way.
But look, Major Barrington, if only you'd let us get back to our transportation we'd be no further nuisance to you.
Now please! Don't let us lose our tempers.
Jamie, I think perhaps we'd better do as they say.
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh good. I'm sure we'll be able to explain everything to his satisfaction.
But I thought you said we were going to see the General?
It's just a temporary misunderstanding, Jamie. We'll get it cleared up when we see the General.
Ah, they were all obeying orders, Zoe. That's the military mind.
Oh, yes, I expect he's a very nice chap.
Major Barrington, how nice to see you.
Court Martial? But we're civilians.
Oh, yes, that may be, but if you'll allow me to explain, we were
Oh, thank you.
Waylaid? The ambulance found us.
This is a travesty of justice. What are we charged with?
But this is monstrous!
Yes, I most certainly have! Am I allowed to question the witnesses?
Thank you. Lady Jennifer, will you please explain to these gentlemen the circumstances of our meeting.
What? Well, Lieutenant Carstairs, when your men recaptured the ambulance, wasn't it obvious to you we were prisoners of the Germans?
Well, if you're not going to allow them to answer, what is the use?
Well, he didn't give me a chance, did he. There's something very strangely wrong here.
Yes, but why?
But this is ridiculous! You know all the evidence has been twisted against us! Tell them!
I most certainly have something further to say! This is all just a mockery! I demand the right to appeal to a higher authority.
Now you stay here, Zoe. Goodbye, my dear.
Oh, thank you. Sergeant Major? Have you been at the front long?
What's the matter?
Zoe!
How on Earth?
Oh, what a nice and clever girl you are. Now, we must find Jamie. They said something about a military prison.
Come on.
Well done, Zoe. Can you undo it?
Oh yes. Yes. Yes, that's it. That's the military prison, all right. That's where Jamie'll be. Take a look. The trouble is those sentries.
Don't know. I shall have to think of something. Come on.
Stop! And about time too! Where have you been?
You were sent to meet us!
Now don't argue! Take us to the prison! In you get, Miss Heriot. Well, drive on!
How dare you treat me like this, sir!
Don't you address me like that, sir! This is disgraceful! I shall make a complaint directly to the Minister himself!
I'm the examiner from the War Office, I'm here to inspect the military prison. This young lady is my secretary. Well, you were expecting us, surely?
How dare you! You send no car to meet us on our arrival, and now you add insult to injury by doubting my credentials! Do you know who I am, sir?
We are here to inspect the security arrangements of the prison. Now I suggest we stop wasting time and get on with it!
Ah.
I'd like to see your records.
I sincerely hope not.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes, arrivals. Latest arrival, Scottish deserter awaiting return to his regiment. Possible to talk to a prisoner?
Is something the matter, Commandant?
Did I hear you say that someone had escaped?
Matter? Why, of course it matters! Shooting down prisoners? Why, it's barbaric!
Well, that's no excuse for murder! I want the other man brought here.
I'm not satisfied. I want to hear the prisoner's side of the story.
We'll see you get a doctor if you need one, my man. Right, let him go. Commandant, dismiss your man.
Speak when you're spoken to! Now then, what's all this about trying to escape?
I'm not concerned with that! What about the other man you escaped with?
I see. This is very serious. I shall have to make a full report.
We'll see what General Smythe has to say about that
What are you doing?
Ah, you'll regret this. The Minister
My identity papers?
Oh, well done, Zoe. Yes, I think he'll survive. Right, come on. Let's see if we can bluff our way out of here.
A redcoat, Jamie?
But that's a complete anachronism.
It's something out of it's own time.
Both these things are in the wrong time. But what are they doing here in 1917?
If you'll take us to the General's room, we'll prove this thing exists!
There's no time to explain now. Now, where is this thing, Zoe?
What? You mean you can't see that screen?
Look at the wall! Concentrate!
Can you see it yet?
Good heavens, this thing is switched on!
No, but somebody may have seen us. We've got to get away from here, all of us.
Well, anywhere so long as it's away from here.
Yes, you can. And you've got to come too. Your lives will be in danger now, both of you.
Now look, my friends and I are leaving here. Are you going to shoot us down?
So what do you want us to do?
No, no, no, no, we must stay here and see what is happening.
Right, Zoe, up you go.
Well, perhaps it's not, perhaps it's not German artillery.
No, but General Smythe might!
Righto! Stay here, keep under cover.
What is it?
Gas?
It's not gas, go on.
Well, move over. Let me, come on.
I don't know, Zoe. Some sort of force field.
Yes. It's odd, Jamie.
Start the engine!
Ah, Lieutenant Carstairs, is this the only map you're supplied with?
It's a bit inadequate, isn't it?
Oh, they were Romans.
Oh, lots of impossible things happen when you pass through time.
Look, it is 1917 where we are now on this map. Where we were attacked by the Romans it is two thousand years ago.
Surely before we met the Romans we passed through a mist didn't we? A gas you called it. Now, supposing this mist is a barrier between different time zones?
Yes. What we need is a map which covers all the time zones. I'm afraid we shall have to get back to General Smythe's headquarters, to the chateau.
Well, that's easy. You will take us!
What? Oh, yes. I'm afraid that there's nothing here, only local maps. Here we are. Perhaps there's something in the General's room. I'll go and see.
Well, only this safe.
Oh, what a good idea.
Well, this is a military establishment, there must be some explosives around here.
Good.
Jamie, I wonder whether perhaps I can pick this lock.
Yes, I know, Jamie. Oh dear, this is useless.
Oh, well, yes, that might blow the room up very nicely, but I don't think it would affect the safe much. You see we have to concentrate the
Whole explosion into the lock there.
Now then, if I can pack the explosive into the lock and then detonate it. Ah, here we are. Now then. Ah yes, I see.
It's all right. I do have the detonator, you know. Now then, just release this. There we are. Now what have we got? Oh yes.
This fuse, how long does it last?
Oh, that's not very good, is it?
There we are.
Now we light the blue touch paper and retire immediately!
We shall have to put the fuse out. It's too late! Duck!
Ah yes. Here we are, Jamie.
Look, Zoe. 1917 zone, Roman zone, American Civil War zone. This whole place is divided into time zones.
Yes. Yes, and I think that that's where we've got to get to.
This is an ambulance. We have a seriously wounded officer in the back.
Ah. You want me to come with you. Ah well, if you put it like that. Yes, here we go.
Why don't you just call me Doctor?
Oh, very well. Doctor John Smith.
Well, we were lost, you see.
I realise this must seem rather strange.
But I can assure you we're quite harmless.
No, no, no, we are not spies.
Well, you see, that's rather difficult to explain.
All right, if you insist.
Well, you told me to tell you the truth.
Why don't you ask my companions if you don't believe me?
Tell him the truth, both of you.
Oh, dear. Look, look, I can prove to you that we come from another time. This is a sonic screwdriver. Now, where can I demonstrate? Ah, that revolver will do. It's all right.
There we are. And back it goes.
Do you believe me now?
Well
Well, it is a little difficult to understand, but
But this is ridiculous.
No, no, no! We are not spies! The sonic screwdriver. We've just shown you with the gun.
Yes, Jamie. Now, it's very simple. Put the gun on the table. You can keep your hand on it again if you like! Now, watch.
That's right.
Oh, we've got lots of tricks like that. Let me show you. Catch, Jamie.
Now then, Lieutenant. I'm sorry about this, but perhaps you'd be good enough to take us back to our ambulance!
Yes. Here we are.
I think we're right about there.
Zoe, we're right. That was an American Civil War soldier.
Yes. But it means we're on the right road, and we're still making for that blank space in the middle of the map.
Come on.
Where have you been? We've done it without you.
What's wrong?
Oh no!
There's only one thing for it. We shall have to go on by foot. Come along.
Oh yes, Jamie, this looks all right.
It was the way he wanted it.
We carry on, of course. We've got no alternative.
Yes. That is where we'll find the answer. Now we'd better get some rest. We'll have to start early in the morning.
Quick, hide!
I must have a look inside.
Yes, Zoe, you're right.
Well, there is an answer to that, but I hope, I just hope.
Zoe, come and see.
They seem to be in some sort of hypnotic trance.
They're going to fight, Zoe. That's what soldiers are for.
Quick, in here!
No, we'd only land up right in the middle of another war.
Well this thing must eventually go back to its base. That's where we've got to get to.
It's taking off again. That settles it.
Yes, all the soldiers have been delivered, so this must be its base.
Yes, well, there are some controls here. I daresay I could get the hang of them.
He must be the person who's controlling this thing.
Yes, you're right. We'd better put them on.
Well, come on, let's explore.
Yes, a sort of training school, but for what?
Yes, I think so. Come on, let's see what else we can find.
Well we were just
Oh, well if you insist.
Lecture?
Quite right, Zoe, quite right.
No, no, no, not yet. Later.
Well, I don't think much of that as a demonstration.
The man was obviously unhinged as a result of your experiment.
Then why did he call me a German spy? It's obviously ridiculous, isn't it.
Huh. Then he's obviously no use for our purposes, is he.
Oh yes, just as I thought. This is your trouble, you know.
Yes, this circuit is overloading the neural paths.
You didn't de-process that man first, did you.
I saw a man whose processing had partly lapsed. You should have completely de-processed him first, but I don't suppose you can do that on a machine like this.
What there?
Yes?
Oh.
Oh yes, I see. Yes, that's fascinating.
Thank you. Come along, Zoe.
Run, Zoe, run!
Yes, I was so interested in your demonstration I felt I had to come along and see how you were getting along.
Really? Why?
Oh no, no, no. Not me, the girl.
Well I was trying to catch her, of course. Has she been caught?
Oh good. How are you getting on with him?
Oh yes, this is interesting. I think you'll find that bit goes just there. Will there be enough of these advanced models ready for our major plan?
Oh but surely you must know, in your position.
I would consider it a great honour if I could simply stand and watch.
Thank you. What are we doing now?
Oh I see. Yes, this is intriguing. Will he remember everything when he wakes up?
Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, certainly.
There we are! Is the de-processing complete?
No, no, please. Don't hurt him. Get him off.
No, don't hurt him. Put him on there. In the machine, quick!
Hoist with his own petard. Come along, Lieutenant. Lieutenant?
What? Well, what do you remember?
Yes, that's right, unfortunately. And brought here, to the aliens war centre and brainwashed again, but you're all right now.
I'll explain as we go along. We must find Zoe. Oh.
Better leave him on simmer.
That must be the Security Room.
Zoe, what have they done to you? Don't you point that thing at me! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, treating a poor young girl like
Oh, well done.
There we are. Now, are you feeling better?
That's was just the question I was going to ask you. What did happen?
Let's have a look. Oh yes, it's a very interesting little gadget.
Really? Oh, well, let's try it, shall we?
Now then, where does this switch? Oh yes, oh, with a slight adjustment
There we are. Yes. What questions did they ask you about these people, Zoe?
Oh yes, the resistance, of course. Yes. That's the American Civil War. The 1914-18 war. Yes, it's all recorded here. Scattered groups of resistance.
Now if we could organise. Zoe, can you remember all the details about the resistance from that thing? Names, faces, Time Zones and so on?
Good. Then we can return to the Time Zones and organise the resistance into one big army! That way they'll have a better chance.
Well, that's simple. The way we came. Come on.
I don't know, but they're going to the landing bay. Come on.
Until one of those things arrives. If I can get inside I'm sure I can control it.
The light's flashing. That means an arrival.
No, there's nothing we can do.
I don't know!
No, no, this way to the processing room.
Don't ask questions, just follow me.
We've got to get in there.
Now that room, the other side. That must've been next door. Yes, come on.
Some sort of preformed plastic, wouldn't you say, Zoe?
Little bits of metal imbedded in it. Yes, I think these panels must be held together by some kind of magnetic forcefield. Now if I could reverse that field. Cut me off some pieces of tape, will you please, Zoe?
That's right. One there, that's right. And one just there.
Well, it's no secret, boy, it's simply a case of reversing the magnetic field of this panel.
What a good idea, yes.
Yes?
Yes, well?
Well, we'll just have to take that risk, won't we? Now then, stand well clear.
Watch.
I hoped he might be.
Well, the guns they use can be adjusted. I think he was just stunned.
I think they've possibly discovered that he was never processed.
No, no, wait.
I don't know, but don't worry, at least we know that he's alive. Now then, we've got to get in there. Lieutenant?
I think you'll find that bit goes there.
It's all right. You're quite safe.
We're your friends.
Well, I'm afraid that they've taken him away. Now, up you get.
Quickly through the gap in the wall here, Zoe, help him.
I'll be a minute.
Just a minute!
Well, it's the headquarters of the people who are running this whole disgraceful business.
Yes, it's not quite as simple as that. There are rather a lot of them.
They have rather sophisticated weapons. You wouldn't stand a chance.
We're going to return to the time zones and organise the resistance into one big army!
Ah yes, we do now. My friend Zoe has memorised an entire list of the resistance and their whereabouts.
Now I must get you all back to the landing bay.
Yes, what we need is some kind of disguise.
It's all right, Jamie, it's me.
All right, put on this great coat.
She's waiting outside. Now come along.
Fall in by twos. Come along, hurry up. There's no time to be lost.
Are you ready? Right. Quick march!
Yes, I think so, Zoe. Now let me see.
Oh my goodness!
There, that should stop them!
Jamie! All right! Now, I'll preset it for the 1917 zone, and off we go.
It's not very difficult, Zoe. Now the doors.
Come along. Don't be afraid, you've gone before.
No, no, I shall follow in a few moments.
No, but I must get the processing machine.
Oh, very well. Go on, Zoe, off you go. We'll follow in a few minutes. Good luck.
We're going to let them in.
Yes, Jamie, that's splendid. Put it in.
There we are. That's it, right. Come on, off we go. Just a minute. Hold that.
They're gas filled valves. Come on.
Yes I hope so, Jamie. There we go.
But, they must have stopped it from the outside.
No, not now. I've set the emergency lock.
Yes, it's only a question of overriding the master control. Now, it's a slightly different design to the Tardis.
Don't worry. These things are impregnable against outside attack.
Very nicely, Jamie. Now, don't worry. Nothing can happen to us in here.
Oh, what have they done?
We've got no choice. We have to do what they say.
What are you going to do with us?
I won't have my friends ill-treated, you know.
I am here under a flag of truce. I demand to know what you are going to do with us.
Oh, I think that that's a perfectly horrid idea.
Anywhere but the 1917 zone, Jamie.
Yes, eventually, but not just now. That's where they'll be looking for us.
Well, we'll go into one of the nearby zones and cross the time zone barrier on foot. Oh! Ah, yes, here we are. (A final symbol goes on the panel.)
Yes, Jamie. I probably confused the controls readjusting them in space, in
Well, no, not really, no.
Come on, here we go. Help me on with the processing machine. Now remember, as soon as we land we must make ourselves scarce.
Well they're bound to be on the alert for us.
Well, I don't know. It's rather difficult to tell, isn't it.
Huh?
Come on! Back to the time zone barrier!
Yes, yes, they can't follow us into a time zone barrier. Oh, Lieutenant Carstairs, do you feel all right?
Oh, good. That means the processing machine is working all right.
Just follow me, Jamie.
Good, I'm very glad to hear it. I suppose you're going to subject us to another one of your farcical courts martial?
And what about my friends?
After some more of your mental processing, I suppose?
Do you have the authority to have me killed?
Your alien superiors will want to question me.
So you're simply being malicious!
Fortunately, Zoe arrived in time. Where's General Smythe?
What? But he'll be calling for help. You've got to stop him!
Why would he want to do that?
I'm not sure, Zoe. I think they've got something to do with the time zone barriers.
Huh?
Oh no! Ohm my word, How many resistance did you bring?
Mister Russell, how long can you hold on here?
Well, you must hold on as long as you can. I think I've got the answer. You see, we have to have a safe base from which to fight these people. I must go and get on with my work.
Give some help, Zoe. I want to dismantle this.
To find out how it works, of course. Don't ask questions, just do what I say.
You go and ask. You go and help Mister Russell.
Now then.
No, I don't think that will be necessary.
Shall we try it, Zoe? Right, here we go.
Shush! Listen.
No, Mister Russell, look out of the window.
Yes. I've set up a time zone barrier all round the chateau.
Exactly, but your people can come and go just as you please. At last we've got a safe base from which to fight them! We can carry out the next step in complete safety.
Is this one of yours, Mister Russell?
He's just the man we need.
I think that will do, Jamie.
I think it's worked.
Oh dear. I wonder whether he's completely back to normal?
Look, try. Try to explain to him what's been happening.
Yes, yes, yes. Everyone we capture we can convert to our side. You'll soon have all the men you need.
Look, Mister Russell, I am doing my best! If you can capture some more equipment I might be able to rig up something that will do dozens at a time.
Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.
I have nothing to say to you.
Oh, do you?
I had every right to leave.
We most certainly are not!
I had reasons of my own.
Your reasons are only too obvious. Power!
I know that you've been kidnapping soldiers from the Earth from various times in it's history and bringing them here to kill one another.
No objective can justify such slaughter.
Yes, but why choose the people of the Earth?
Well, that simply isn't true.
But why make them kill each other?
You have given these aliens our science and our knowledge to carry out this disgusting plan.
An empire of slaves, with you as one of it's rulers.
No.
I never promised to help you!
But to help people like that to conquer the galaxy?
Jamie? Zoe?
Is Mister Russell there?
Oh, good. Now there's no time to be lost. I think I can send you one of their space time machines. I've managed to gain control of their transportation system.
Oh, no, no. All I need is a party of picked men. There's got quite a lot to organise. I have to talk to the leaders.
Jamie, please don't argue. I will send the transportation now.
Ah, Carstairs.
Zoe.
Jamie.
Yes, yes, everything is under control. Now listen, everyone. Just follow me. We're going to take over the war room!
Stand still, don't move! You are completely surrounded!
Well, I hope so, but you know, I find it hard to understand why you need me.
It's something to do with the Tardis travel machines, isn't it?
I must congratulate you on them, you know. You're achieved a remarkable degree of control.
Oh, my dear fellow, you're too modest. Dimensional flexibility? Remote control? In my day these things were impossible to achieve without shortening the life of the time control units.
Yes, there must have been. That particular problem is impossible to solve. How did you solve it?
You haven't solved it, have you? Your machines have a limited life span. Sooner or later they're going to be useless.
Now I understand. It's my Tardis that you're after, isn't it?
Yes, but without me and my Tardis your ambitions are going to be rather hard to realise, aren't they?
Well, I like to be on the winning side.
Well, I hadn't realised how small and weak their groups were compared with your might and power.
Well, your processing machines. I can make them work more effectively.
Ah yes, but that will take time. I can make the old ones work just as well. Probably better.
They are no longer my friends. They are our enemies.
What? But you
No. No! Don't come any closer, no!
Oh no, leave me alone!
They were going to drop a neutron bomb! You'd all be dead now, and all of your resistance friends with you, if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I am trying to save your lives! If you do exactly as I tell you'll be all right.
Yes, and it was very nearly fatal.
I never promised to help you!
To help people like that gain control of the galaxy?
Oh yes, quite sure. I think that will do. There we are. Now then, when this young man comes to, he will believe himself to be fighting the English Redcoats in 1745. Now get up!
What is your name?
Your name.
Do you know where you are?
You are in my castle. I am the McCrimmon of McCrimmon, your hereditary Chieftain.
Well, that is a friendly chieftain. You will obey his orders as you will mine.
There you are, you see? Complete loyalty and devotion. I can do the same with all the other resistance people that you capture.
Thank you. Bring the girl!
You will obey us. It is for your own good. (wink)
There we are. Now then, sit up, sit up! Now then, you are in la Castille de la Cruz de San Antonio de la Frada Forma, in Mexico.
Stop! Get him off me!
Yes. I fix her, and you nearly fixed me.
They were going to drop the neutron bomb. You were better alive here than dead out there.
Yes, very successfully from what I hear.
Don't harm him. We may need him.
Did you really think I'd take part in your disgusting, stealing scheme?
I'm sure that the War Chief is going to cooperate. He's going to help us gain control of the War Room.
I see. Very well, but first you'll take us to the War Room. You're the only one that can stop the fighting in the Zones.
No. I mean, yes. Come along, Jamie, Zoe.
Will somebody turn off that hideous noise? I cannot think!
Yes, I've been thinking about that.
Yes. Call off the fighting at once!
You could, we can't. The fighting has to be stopped and everyone sent back to their own times.
By your Tardis travel machines, of course.
What? But, oh my word, well that's happened rather sooner than I expected.
Oh, well, yes, I
I can still do that.
You stop the fighting!
The only people who can put an end to this whole ghastly business and send everyone back to their own times. The Time Lords.
They're my own people, Jamie.
No, it's not, Zoe. But I'm afraid that there's no alternative.
Yes, Zoe, I'm all right.
It's a box, Jamie.
It's a very special sort of box. It now contains all the information about what's been going on here, and an appeal for help.
Yes, Zoe.
I've never really needed it before, Jamie, but this business of sending everyone back to their own times is, well, it's too difficult for me.
Now, come along. The War Chief!
He's gone!
He must be trying to get away before the Time Lords get here!
We must go to the landing bay and stop him.
Yes, but they won't be expecting us. Come on.
No, no, that won't be necessary. We'll leave him for the Time Lords to dispose of.
I'm going to send for them now. And I want you all to stay here and wait until they come.
Well, I cannot stay here. Jamie, Zoe, this is where we say goodbye.
Well, the Time Lords will return you home.
Because when I send this box to them, they'll know where I am.
Yes, Jamie, they are my people, but. Oh, it'd take too long to explain. I have to go!
But you don't understand! Oh, very well, but don't say I didn't warn you. Right then, we must return to the 1917 Zone and find the Tardis, and make good our escape.
Oh yes, very well.
Well, goodbye, gentlemen. I'm sorry, but we must rush.
The Time Lords will return you home. Now come along.
But you don't understand, Mister Russell. I must go. Please!
Look, I am not going to argue. Jamie, Zoe, Carstairs, into the machine.
For once, Jamie, do as you are told!
Then you will just have to kill me, Mister Villar.
Yes, well, goodbye, Lieutenant.
There's the Tardis. We've got to get on.
Come on!
Come on!
Time Lords! Try harder! We must get away!
We must get away!
It's a force field. Concentrate. We may be able to break through it. Help me with the key. Concentrate!
Yes, I hope so, Jamie. If I can boost the power enough, the Tardis may be able to break through the force field.
It was the Time Lords.
Yes, that's right.
What? Well, I was bored.
Well, the Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment, we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space time travel.
Well we hardly ever use our great powers. We consent simply to observe and to gather knowledge.
No, of course not. With a whole galaxy to explore? Millions of planets, eons of time, countless civilisations to meet?
Well, It is a fact, Jamie, that I do tend to get involved with things.
Yes, yes, but that's no excuse in their eyes.
We're going to run away. I've set the controls to take us to a planet on the outermost fringes of the galaxy.
Well, that is impossible!
It's all right. It can't possibly harm us.
We're perfectly safe in the Tardis.
Oh my word! It's the Time Lords. They're breaking down the defensive mechanism. We've got to get out of here.
Well, I know one place where we'll be safe, if I can get us there.
We're in outer space. We'll just stop here for a while. There's a chance we may have given them the slip.
Why can't you leave me alone? I haven't done any harm.
Oh, oh, oh, very well, if I must.
I'm trying to make a quick transference jump. We've got to get away from here to somewhere safe. Ah, we're landing.
Oh, no!
I'll try. Oh, the controls. They're moving by themselves.
It's my own planet. They have brought us here.
No, not this time. Come along.
Jamie, do as he says.
The Time Lords holding a trial is a very rare event.
Well, normally they don't interfere with the affairs of other planets, but they had to when I called for help.
Well, you and Zoe may, but I don't think I will.
Oh, oh, I beg your pardon.
Everything in that report is the result of my direct personal observation.
That is the War Lord.
Can't you see he's just playing for time?
I never supported your scheme for one moment.
Oh, good. I'm glad to see your sense of justice still prevails. (sotto) Even though they've lost their sense of humour.
Oh, no!
You'll never get away. The Time Lords are too strong for you. You needn't think I'm going to help you.
I can't, I tell you. The directional mechanism is faulty.
But I don't even know where your home planet is.
I'll do my best, but I can't promise anything. Jamie, Zoe, hide your eyes. Run!
Jamie, they are not going to let us go.
I not only admit them, I am proud of them. While you have been content merely to observe the evil in the galaxy, I have been fighting against it.
No, no, of course, you're above criticism, aren't you.
Yes, of course, I do. Give me a thought channel and I'll show you some of the evils I've been fighting against.
The Quarks, deadly robot servants of the cruel Dominators, they tried to enslave a peace loving race. Then there were the Yeti, more robot killers, instruments of an alien intelligence trying to take over the planet Earth.
You asked me to justify my actions, I am doing so. Let me show you the Ice Warriors, cruel Martian invaders, they tried to conquer the Earth too. So did the Cybermen, half creature, half machine. But worst of all were the Daleks, a pitiless race of conquerors exterminating all who came up against them. All these evils I have fought while you have done nothing but observe. True, I am guilty of interference, just as you are guilty of failing to use your great powers to help those in need!
Well, isn't it enough?
Jamie! Zoe!
Oh, thank you.
Jamie! Zoe!
Oh, nothing much. I expect they'll to make me listen to a long boring speech about being a good boy. They like making speeches.
Well, that's easier said than done.
Well, you don't know the Time Lords, Jamie. I do.
Well. Oh, all right, but we may find it a bit difficult getting out of here.
Forgotten?
Yes, yes, of course.
No Zoe, not this time. Well, goodbye, Jamie.
Goodbye, Jamie.
I won't forget you. Don't go blundering into too much trouble, will you?
Goodbye, Zoe.
Again? Now, Zoe, you and I know, time is relative, isn't it?
They'll forget me, won't they?
She'll be all right, won't she?
What about Jamie?
Yes, very efficient. Now then, what about me?
What? You mean that you're going to let me go free?
Yes, I suppose that's true. Earth seems more vulnerable than others, yes.
Oh, good.
In exile?
But you, you can't condemn me to exile on one primitive planet in one century in time! Besides, I'm known on the Earth. It might be very awkward for me.
You can't just change what I look like without consulting me!
Oh, well, that's not so bad. But I warn you, I'm very particular.
Oh he's too old! Well he's too fat, isn't he. No, he's too thin. That one's too young. Oh now, that won't do at all. It's ridiculous.
It's not my fault, is it? Is this the best you can do? I've never seen such an incredible bunch.
No, no, no, I never said that. But I maintain I have the right to decide what I look like! It could be very important on the Earth. People on Earth attach a very great deal of importance
Ah, what's happening?
What's hap, what's happened?
Is this some sort of joke? No, I refuse to be treated in. What are you doing?
No! Stop, you're making me giddy! No, you can't do this to me! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

And then we discovered it wasn't the Robot King after all, it was the real one. Fortunately, I was able to re-attach the head.
Oh, it's the warning lights. I'm getting rid of those. They never stop.
The door. It knocked.
Very, very deep.
And somebody's knocking.
Oh, come here. Come here, you scrumptious little beauty.
I've got mail. Time Lord emergency messaging system. In an emergency, we'd wrap up thoughts in psychic containers and send them through time and space. Anyway, there's a living Time Lord still out there, and it's one of the good ones.
There are no Time Lords left anywhere in the universe. But the universe isn't where we're going. See that snake?
The mark of the Corsair. Fantastic bloke. He had that snake as a tattoo in every regeneration. Didn't feel like himself unless he had the tattoo. Or herself, a couple of times. Ooo, she was a bad girl.
We're leaving the universe.
With enormous difficulty. Right now I'm burning up Tardis rooms to give us some welly. Goodbye, swimming pool. Goodbye, scullery. Sayonara, squash court seven.
Outside the universe, where we've never, ever been.
The power, it's draining. Everything's draining. But it can't. That's, that's impossible.
It's as if the Matrix, the soul of the Tardis, has just vanished. Where would it go?
He was in a bind. A bit of a pickle. Sort of distressed.
Not end of, outside of.
Imagine a great big soap bubble with one of those tiny little bubbles on the outside.
Well, it's nothing like that. Completely drained. Look at her.
Yeah. No. But if it helps, yes. This place is full of rift energy. She'll probably refuel just by being here. Now, this place. What do we think, eh? Gravity's almost Earth normal, air's breathable, but it smells like
Armpits.
Well, there's a rift. Now and then stuff gets sucked through it. Not a bubble, a plughole. The universe has a plughole and we've just fallen down it.
Why am I a thief? What have I stolen?
Ow! Ow!
Sorry? The little what? Boxes?
Oh, hello!
Oh, no, it's all right. It's an Ood. Oods are good. Love an Ood. Hello, Ood. Can't you talk? Oh, I see. It's damaged. May I? It might just be on the wrong frequency.
No, no. It's picking up something else. But that's, that's not possible. That's, that's. Who else is here? Tell me. Show me. Show me.
The House? What's the House?
I'd love to.
Time Lords. It's not just the Corsair. Somewhere close by there are lots and lots of Time Lords.
I see. This asteroid is sentient.
Yes. So you're like a sea urchin. Hard outer surface, that's the planet we're walking on. Big, squashy, oogly thing inside, that's you.
Ah. So you've met Time Lords before?
So there are Time Lords here, then?
Well, there won't be any more after us. Last Time Lord. Last Tardis.
Well, it seems like a friendly planet. Literally. Mind if we poke around a bit?
Come on then, gang. We're just going to, er, see the sights.
Shush, shush, shush.
No. There are Time Lords here. I heard them and they need me.
Yes, yes, but if they're like the Corsair, they're good one and I can save them.
I can explain. Tell them why I had to.
Don't we all?
My screwdriver. I left it in the Tardis. It's in my jacket.
My other jacket.
Yes, boss.
Rory, look after her.
Yeah, it's around somewhere. Have a good look.
Come on. Where are you? Now, where are you all? Where are you?
Well, they can't all be in here.
Just admiring your Time Lord distress signal collection. Nice job. Brilliant job. Really thought I had some friends here, but this is what the Ood translator picked up. Cries for help from the long dead. How many Time Lords have you lured here the way you lured me, and what happened to them all?
House repairs you when you break. Yes, I know. But how does he mend you? You've got the eyes of a twenty year old.
No. Oh, no, I mean it literally. Your eyes are thirty years younger than the rest of you. Your ears don't match, your right arm is two inches longer than you're left, and how's your dancing? Because you've got two left feet. Patchwork people. You've been repaired and patched up so often, I doubt there's anything left of what used to be you. I had an umbrella like you once.
Corsair.
You gave me hope, and then you took it away. That's enough to make anyone dangerous. God knows what it will do to me. Basically, run!
Time Lord stuff. Needed you out of the way.
The boxes will make you angry. How could she know?
Stay put. Stay exactly where you are.
How did you know about the boxes? You said they'd make me angry. How did you know?
Who are you?
I don't understand. Who are you?
They said you were dangerous.
The Tardis?
No, you're not. You're a bitey, mad lady. The Tardis is up and downy stuff in a big blue box.
I said you were the most beautiful thing I had ever known.
I borrowed you.
You're the Tardis?
My Tardis?
Like what?
But why? Why pull the living soul from a Tardis and pop it in a tiny human head? What does it want you for?
How do you know?
House what? What do you mean?
When?
House eats Tardises?
When do I say that?
Of course. House feeds on rift energy and Tardises are bursting with it. And not raw, all lovely and cooked. Processed food. Mmm, fish fingers.
But you can't eat a Tardis. it would destroy you. Unless, unless
So it deleted you.
I sent Amy and Rory in there. They'll be eaten. Amy! Amy? Rory? Get the hell out of there.
It's House. He's after the Tardis. Just get out both of you.
But I've unlocked it.
Open!
Open this door!
Amy. Rory!
Amy? Amy, can you hear me? (no) Okay, right. I don't, I really don't know what to do. That's a new feeling.
It's gone.
No, it left. Not eaten, hi-jacked. But why?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go? What do you mean, go? Where are you going?
It won't.
Not dead. You can't just die!
Why?
You're dying.
On what? How? I'm a madman with a box, without a box. I'm stuck down the plughole at the end of the universe on a stupid old junkyard. Ooo.
I'm not.
Because it's not a junkyard. Don't you see? It's not a junkyard.
It's a Tardis junkyard. Come on! Oh, sorry. Do you have a name?
But what do I call you?
Only when we're alone.
Oh. Come on then, Sexy.
A valley of half eaten Tardises. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Ah. Sorry. No, I wasn't thinking that.
It's not impossible as long as we're alive. Rory and Amy need me. So yeah, we're going to build a Tardis.
Yes, yes, I have actually rebuilt a Tardis before, you know. I know what I'm doing.
I always read the instructions.
That's not instructions.
Pull to open.
I push.
I think I have earned the right to open my front doors any way I want.
You are not my mother.
You know, since we're talking with mouths, not really an opportunity that comes along very often, I just want to say, you know, you have never been very reliable.
You didn't always take me where I wanted to go.
You did. Look at us talking. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could always talk, even when you're stuck inside the box?
You okay?
Using a console without a proper shell. It's not going to be safe.
Then we need to get a move on. Eh, old girl?
How is this going to make it through the rift? How? We're almost done. Thrust diffuser? Er, retroscope. Blue thingy.
I chose you. You were unlocked.
Right. Perfect. Look at that. What could possibly go wrong?
That's fine. That always happens. No, hang on. Wait.
Right. Okay, let's go. Follow that Tardis.
Oh no, come on. There's rift energy everywhere. You can do it. Okay, diverting all power to thrust. Let's be having you.
No, no, no, no.
It can't hold the charge. It can't even start. There's no power. I've got nothing.
Whoo hoo!
Can you get a message to Amy? The telepathic circuits are online.
Don't worry. Telepathic messaging. No, that's Rory.
The pretty one?
How's he going to be able to take down the shields anyway? The House is in the control room.
There aren't any old control rooms. They were all deleted or remodelled.
But I've only changed the desktop, what, a dozen times?
You can't archive something that hasn't happened yet.
Keep going. You're doing it, you sexy thing.
You bet it's your name.
We're not quite there yet. Just hold on. Amy, this is, well, she's my Tardis. Except she's a woman. She's a woman, and she's my Tardis.
And she's a woman. She's a woman and she's the Tardis.
Shut up. Not like that.
Oh. Still shut up.
Ah. Well, he must have been redistributed.
You're breathing him.
Another Ood I failed to save.
Well, that's me all over, isn't it? Lovely old unexpected me.
You really don't want to do that.
Because then I won't be able to help you. Listen to your engines. Just listen to them. You don't have the thrust and you know it. Right now I'm your only hope for getting out of your little bubble through the rift, and into my universe. And mine's the one with the food in.
You just have to promise not to kill us. That's all, just promise.
I'm very serious. I'm sure it's an entity of its word.
Hey. Hang in there, old girl. Not long now. It'll be over soon.
Fine. Okay. I trust you. Just delete, oh er, thirty percent of the Tardis rooms, you'll free up thrust enough to make it through. Activate subroutine Sigma nine.
Because we want to get back to our universe as badly as you do. And I'm nice.
Yes. I mean, you could do that, but it just won't work. Hardwired fail safe. Living things from rooms that are deleted are automatically deposited in the main control room. But thanks for the lift.
Fear me. I've killed all of them.
Yeah, you're right. You've completely won. Oh, you can kill us in oodles of really inventive ways, but before you do kill us allow me and friends Amy and Rory to congratulate you on being an absolutely worthy opponent.
Yep, you've defeated us. Me and my lovely friends here, and last but definitely not least, the Tardis Matrix herself, a living consciousness you ripped out of this very control room and locked up into a human body. And look at her.
No. It's never enough. You forced the Tardis into a body so she'd burn out safely a very long way away from this control room. A flesh body can't hold the Tardis Matrix and live. Look at her body, House.
No. I think you should be very, very careful about what you let back into this control room. You took her from her home. But now she's back in the box again, and she's free.
Oh, look at my girl. Look at her go. Bigger on the inside. You see, House?
That's your problem. Size of a planet, but inside you are just so small.
Finish him off, girl.
I'm here.
What word?
Alive isn't sad.
Goodbye?
Please. I don't want you to. Please.
Where?
Just putting a firewall around the Matrix. Almost done.
I can't.
Well, actually, it's because the Time Lords discovered that if you take an eleventh dimensional matrix and fold it into a mechanical then. Yes, it's spacey wacey.
What did she say?
Not yet. You okay?
Letting it get to you. You know what that's called? Being alive. Best thing there is. Being alive right now, that's all that counts. Nearly finished. Two more minutes, then we're off. The Eye of Orion's restful, if you like restful. I can never really get the hang of restful. What do you think, dear? Where shall we take the kids this time?
Well, you say that as if it's a bad thing. But honestly, it's the best thing there is. The House deleted all the bedrooms. I should probably make you two a new bedroom. You'd like that, wouldn't you?
No. Bunk beds are cool. A bed with a ladder. You can't beat that. It's your room. Out those stairs, keep walking till you find it. Off you pop.
Are you there? Can you hear me? Oh, I'm a silly old. Okay. The Eye of Orion, or wherever we need to go.
Ha ha! Whoo hoo.

We have, my dear.
Well, we should know about that when we have a look at the scanner, shan't we. Now, you can both take a look.
Quiet, both of you, will you?! Listen. Listen.
Exactly. Exactly. There isn't a sound out there. Not a sound! Just silence.
Well, the atmospheric pressure's quite normal. Oxygen, temperature, radiation. It's all quite normal. I wonder. Hmm. I wonder if it's possible to have a planet so obviously conducive to life and yet without any?
Yes, I don't see why not, my child. It appears absolutely deserted. As a matter of fact, I think we shall get some long-deserved, undisturbed peace for once.
My dear young man, this isn't a joy ride. This is a scientific expedition.
From past experience, we must always be on our guard.
Shh, shh!
Yes. Like something trying to discover by touch. Something blind.
Yes, it is blind.
As you say, my dear, whatever it is.
Just look, now. Now look, that's something quite different, isn't it?
Yes, yes, it might be that. To its controller, whoever it might be.
It's gone now.
You know, I must be wrong, child. There is life out there. Yes, a very intelligent, highly intelligent life, to build machines like that.
Well, Chumbley, if you like, my child.
I'm going to find out. Come along, my child, and bring my stick.
Oh, it's delightful. Yes, thank you. Just about the right amount of oxygen.
Oh, indeed, how delightful. Well, there's one thing child, there's no Chumblies about.
This silence reminds of the planet Xeros.
No, no, my dear, not again, not again, but it's so quiet.
Stand still, otherwise we all might be killed. We come in peace. We don't wish you any harm.
No, but by the look of that thing sticking out in front, it's unmistakably like a speaker to me.
You dumb fool!
Oh, indeed. That was very noble of you, indeed. Now you've put the thing on its guard. Yes, it's interesting, it's fascinating. Did you notice that it didn't do anything until you made a noise?
Oh yes, and very accurately. You know, I believe it can locate us by some form of heat wave, as it were.
Stand still. Don't let it move you.
As neat a threat as ever I saw.
Well, it's some kind of light ray, very powerful and dangerous, I would say. I think we're better do what the thing wants.
What's that?
What might the Drahvins be?
Why can't you tell us?
I see.
The Rills. Are these the people that control these things?
Oh, I should like to meet these Rills.
It's only what they say, and who are they?
Yes, all right. Well, perhaps you'd better take us to this Maaga, this leader, whatever it is.
They're all magnetised so that you can't get the top off.
Goodness gracious!
Come! Come!
Quickly! Quickly!
Oh, good gracious!
Yes, I think so. It's all this physical exercise at my age.
It's pretty backward now, isn't it? Yes, it's almost fossilised.
Are we safe here?
Maaga. We're back there again.
Yes, madam, the young lady speaks the truth. The Chumblies are magnetised.
Yes, thank you, I will.
Oh, naturally.
I see.
Oh, as bad as that?
Oh, come now, there's no need to exaggerate.
Disintegrates? This planet?
When?
Well, that sounds reasonable enough to me.
Yes, feminine. Ah, female.
Yours must be a very interesting civilisation. You attacked the Rills?
Well, that's no description, no description at all.
Yes, I think I'm beginning to understand.
Switch off the outside radio? Why, I wonder?
Yes, yes, madam! You may not but I'd like to hear it.
Ah, I see. It's stopped.
You didn't do it very much damage, did you?
And you haven't destroyed one Chumbley yet.
You know, I think you rather underestimate the Rills. Why should they tell you that this planet is going to die?
On the other hand, it might have been a pack of lies.
Well this planet could last another million years.
I have. I'm a scientist.
Oh, thank you, thank you. Well, I'm afraid we shall have to go back to my ship.
Oh, but why?
Oh, you worry too much!
But my dear!
Yes, well, very well. Young man, you and I will go.
Well, they'd have to be pretty well advanced to break my force barrier.
Hmm?
I wonder what they're up to, eh?
There, you see, my boy? Look. Not a scratch. Not a scratch.
I certainly excelled myself with that force barrier.
Oh, now wait a minute. I think they've all gone to bed. Well, it's a very good thing I brought you around, young man, to tell me what I'm supposed to be doing.
The Rills were quite right.
Yes, if the Drahvins let us go.
They need our help with the Rills! Why do you think they've held Vicki back?
It's imperative that we leave at once.
Two dawns! Tomorrow is the last day this planet will ever see.
I wish I knew.
No. No, it's waiting for something.
I can't quite see.
Oh, thank you. Oh! Oh! I think Guy Fawkes must have been resurrected.
Yes, well. Are you all right dear boy?
No, no, no. no, no, no, no. It'd take more than that to get in here.
Yes, well, it's going to be disappointed, isn't it. Look, you see? There they go. Look, away into the distance, empty-handed.
Yes, yes, unless they come back with a piece more trouble, I wonder. Come on, we must go. So little time.
Two dawns. Come on, come on!
Are you talking to yourself, dear boy?
Yes, yes. I don't think much of it. It's not very well advanced, is it? In fact, as you say, it's old-fashioned. Yes. I don't think these Drahvins are very intelligent, do you?
Yes, well, it's tough, but, it's not impregnable. No, it's very common metal really. Yes, its it's nothing unusual, nothing unusual. Well, I suggest that we go in instead of standing around here admiring the scenery. Come along.
But you brought up the subject. Now don't argue, please. Don't argue. I've never heard such rubbish.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, my child, I'm all right.
They tried to blow us up inside the Tardis.
Well of course they didn't. My ship's not made of tin like this old trash. Oh, good gracious me! Seems if I cough too loudly, the whole thing'd fall to pieces.
Ah, yes. Whatever that might be.
Is that necessary?
Hmm.
Yes.
I'm afraid so.
Exactly when the Rills said it would. In fourteen dawns time.
Hmm?
To do what, exactly?
And how do I do that? What happens then?
Well, I mean, what happens to the Rills?
We only have your word for that. In any case, I can't help you.
In the first place, madam, I never kill anything. Neither do my friends.
Or, as the young man suggests, why don't you both go off together?
Yes, a very good question, dear boy.
Yes, all these objections sum up mine. It's none of our business. It's impossible. I'm afraid we can't help you. And it does appear to me that none of you have tried to help yourselves.
No.
Very likely.
A very good attempt, my boy. Never mind.
Yes, I don't seem to have much chance.
Oh, er, yes, quite.
Yes, quite sure.
Oh, but why should I lie?
Fourteen dawns time.
Two dawns.
It may not be ready yet.
Oh, you have great faith in me, haven't you.
You will do as the young man suggests.
Come along, Vicki. We have very little time. Madam, do I begin by walking through this?
Oh, I was just ruminating about the night and day. I was wondering when it was going to get dark, then I just realised that there's three suns on this planet.
Oh yes, they must, my dear, they must, otherwise this Maaga woman wouldn't be talking about dawns. Probably lasts about two hours.
You remember when we were captured by those Chumblies?
That ray gun, why did they use it on the ship? I mean, if the Rills are such enemies of the Drahvins, why don't they just wipe them out?
Oh, don't you believe that, my dear. Don't you believe that for one minute. No, that ray gun could go through this like a piece of paper.
No, it's all very odd, isn't it? Yes, it's very odd.
Oh. Yes, of course, nearly one dawn. Yes, we must start that journey. Are you nervous?
Fascinating things to watch, ay? I wonder what the principal of the operation is? I suppose it's quite simple once you know.
Hmm?
Ah, yes, yes, that's quite a problem, my child, isn't it.
Well, now don't lose patience, you see. Now look, in this case, first we must observe, note, collate, and then conclude. After that, perhaps we can act.
Shh, shh, shh. Quiet, quiet.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get us killed?
Yes, yes, yes, you may appear to be right, but it's dangerous, and it's very risky!
Oh yes, yes, yes, quite so, yes, yes. You about finished? This time I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. But, well now, I suppose we've got to make a run for it.
I think I can drag my aged limbs in some sort of semblance of a run. Go on.
Look! That looks like the home of the Rills.
Yes. And what's that other thing?
Yes, it does, doesn't it. What could they be drilling for?
Yeah. Well, there's only one way to find out. Go on.
We'd be in trouble. You know, this is a nice piece of building.
It's most impressive. Yes, most impressive. And what's this, I wonder? You know, I think these Rills are far more advanced than I thought they were,.
Yes, or some kind of machinery for converting air into something else. Yes, it's most interesting. Can you see anything?
I'll lead the way.
You know, this looks as though it's been built for the Chumblies.
Hmm?
Can you smell anything?
What is it?
Yes, so should I. Come on.
Well, I must say, it's an astonishing shape and design. Marvellous work. Marvellous.
That what?
What's it doing, listening or smelling? Come on, Come on.
A spaceship!
You can't scratch the metal. Isn't that astounding? Yes, it's far superior, far superior. Wonderful stuff for a spaceship.
Hmm?
Well, I should say this is some sort of repair shop. Yes, and that's a what, a Chumbley attachment?
Yes, a revelation, a revelation.
Not awake just yet.
There's a Chumbley coming! Quickly!
Come on.
This way. Come on, we'll make it.
I can't move it. It's immovable! Wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. I might be able to sabotage them. Be patient. We know what this machine's for. This is to convert air into ammonia gas.
Yes, well, have patience child. When I've finished with this machine, I'm sure they will release you.
No! No! That's the last thing we do. This is the thing that gives them the gas to breathe with.
My dear child, the Rills can't go outside. It's a foregone conclusion.
Well, I think you you'd better do what they want.
Yes, that was one of the Rills, I suppose.
Look, you go with them, quickly, but don't cause any trouble. It'll give me time to see if I can help you. I think perhaps I can do something to that machine, but I must have time, yes?
All right, don't worry. Goodbye.
Oh, child.
Are you sure you're all right, child?
Is that a Rill talking?
Oh yes, you were told correctly.
Oh, I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. I thought you couldn't hear.
Ah, yes, it does occurs to me that if we do that we might be trapped.
Well, yes. Indeed. Of course, child. Yes, that's quite true, quite true. Yes, well, lead the way, lead the way. As it happens, I'd like to take a look round. What's this? What's this fellow doing?
Ah, yes. Quite so.
Tell me, what do these Rills look like?
Oh? Why ever not?
Oh, what nonsense. We're not children, you know.
Oh, very well. Carry on, carry on. Oh, what utter rubbish, isn't it?
Oh, yes. This this drill rigging here. Tell me, what is it you drilling for?
Very well, if you take my advice, you'll get a move on. There's very little time left.
Oh yes, we know more than you. Your timing is wrong. The disintegration of this planet is not fourteen dawns away. It is now less than two dawns.
Two dawns.
I think I might be able to supply you with the power you need. Yes, I think I'll help you, since you're so willing to help us.
First I will need some metal-cored cable.
Splendid, splendid. I think I can put into effect the transference of power from my ship to this. Now, first of all, I must have a conversion. Now is that possible?
What's the matter, hmm?
That won't be necessary, my dear. He's quite capable enough of looking after himself. Now, the cable, please, the cable.
Yes, good. Good. Yes, I think that's enough. That should be all right. Now then, let me have your arm. That's splendid. Now, follow me to the ship.
I must go at once.
But what can they do?
You stay here, child.
All right. Come, then, come. Come along. And you, stay here until you receive a message. Come on! Quickly! Quickly! Quick!
What is wrong?
Back to your spaceship, of course.
We're going to help you and Maaga and the rest of them to get to the Rill spaceship. We wish to save lives, not to destroy them.
Now, madam! Listen to me!
Nonsense. Let us stop this thought of killing anyone. Now, madam, back to your spaceship. Back please.
Come along, my boy. Up on your feet. Quickly! Come along. Come on, come on. Put your head down. Now breathe deeply. Come along.
Steady. Take it easy. You're with friends.
Yes, thanks to the Chumblies. They did the trick. I don't know what those Drahvins were going to think. Come on, keep breathing. Keep breathing. In and out. In and out. Come on.
Be all right in a minute.
I certainly will. Can you walk? Come on, my boy, on your feet. Come along. That way. That way. Come on. Keep breathing hard. In and out.
About six hours, child. Have you finished that conversion?
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
Oh, indeed, that's very noble of you all. It's a matter of urgency. Come along, let's have the cable in please at once.
Quickly, quickly. Quickly, child. Here. Yes, that'll do. Splendid.
Hmm?
I'm going to try to transfer power from my ship into the interior of the Rill ship here.
Now if you suspect there's any trouble whilst I'm working, I want you to contact me at once, understood?
Yes, I want you to stay here with the leader of the Rills and try and have some rest. Get some. So, contain yourself. Now then. Right, off you go.
Yes, child, if you wish. Come along. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come along.
Hmm? Oh, it's nothing to worry about, my dear. I think the evenings last here for about four hours.
No, not just nothing, child. Hydrogen gas that springs itself out like molten silver against the other stars in the same galaxy. Yes, well, let's have the cable, please.
Everything under control, my dear boy.
Switch on your motors, please.
Yes, it is, my dear.
Oh, three to four hours, I think.
I fully appreciate that fact, young man.
And the Chumbley outside my Tardis?
Thank you, thank you.
Oh, do stop worrying, dear boy, and stand still.
Splendid, splendid. Is the power still coming through?
That should be enough.
Utterly impossible, dear boy. There's great danger of the panel blowing.
Hmm?
Hello, I'm in here. Come in. Come in.
Come along, come along, come along.
I do. And I, for one, am glad of it.
Yes, of course, of course.
Not now. I must admit, it did at first.
You are different from us, of course, but at least you are intelligent.
Importance lies in the character and to what use you put this intelligence. We respect you as we respect all life.
What's the matter, my child?
Oh dear, dear, dear, yes, I
Ah, yes, thank you. Young man. Young man.
One hour.
One hour and a half.
Oh, patience, dear boy, patience.
Oh, really, you two.
Ah! That is a signal that the spaceship is now fully charged, unless I'm very much mistaken.
Oh, good, good. Now, you have sufficient power?
Splendid, splendid. Then I don't think there's any more for us to do. We will go.
And yourself?
Oh, we shall be quite all right. It is you that needs to be out of range, not us. The moment I start my motors, we shall be out of range in time. We don't need space.
Yes, I think I understand, and thank you very much.
They've started the motors.
Yes, you're quite right. Quickly, quickly, come, come.
Isn't it amazing? What a wonderful sight! Oh!
Yes, yes, of course.
No, I'm afraid not, dear boy. We've dematerialised from that galaxy.
A long time ago.
What's the matter, child?
Oh, yes, I'm afraid we shall, yes, we'll just have to put a cold compress on that. Oh dear, dear, dear. You know, I wish we could stop somewhere for a while and take stock of ourselves, instead of being surrounded by dangers all the time. Just put that third switch forward, would you? Thank you.
Yes. Yes, I wonder.

Ah, this looks about right. World War Two uniforms. No need to worry about looking silly.
Oh, whine, whine, whine, whine.
You can always go back.
Not in those clothes.
About time too! Call yourselves Royal Marines? You're a disgrace. Those boots are filthy. What would happen if the Germans attacked now?
I don't suppose you know where Doctor Judson's office is? Never mind. This way.
You must be Doctor Judson. Excuse the interruption. I've travelled a long way to meet you.
The Prisoner's Dilemma.
Based on a false premise, don't you think,
Thank you.
Ace.
Doctor.
Two pens, please.
Ah, thank you.
There we are. Come in.
Unauthorised? We are here by urgent request of the War Office. I think you'll find this is signed by the Prime Minister and the head of the Secret Service.
Need to know, Captain, need to know. Doctor Judson's work at trying to break the German codes is very important to the war effort.
The Ultima machine? Yes.
Commander? Well, on second thoughts, it's been a tiring day. Perhaps tomorrow, Doctor Judson. If you'll just show us to our quarters, we'd be grateful. Thank you.
Quiet, Ace. People are trying to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Night air. Go to sleep.
Eyes. Eyes watching.
Pardon me. I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for Doctor Judson.
Answering questions is never a waste of time.
Nietzsche says
I was having a good conversation.
Fascinating. Ace, look at this.
Viking rune stones. Ninth century, yes?
Well, it's the alphabet. The later Vikings used a sixteen character alphabet.
Hmm?
What noise?
Organ bellows. Come on, let's leave Doctor Judson to his puzzles.
Look.
No, at the ground.
Subsidence. And since the grave was dug.
Well, either that, or they'd been at the communion wine when they'd put up the headstone. Joseph Sundvik. He must be one of the descendants of the original Viking settlers.
Where did you say you were meeting your two friends?
I think I'll go with you.
What's that?
It's not the kind of place people come for picnics.
Not ordinary tourists. Not English, anyway.
Look at the lettering.
Russian.
I think they already know.
More to the point, where have they come from? From the north, like Vikings. I think I'd better go back to the church.
Well, if you find churches boring, you can stay here, but don't go into the water.
Possibly not.
I'd like to know the answer.
Afraid, yes, but of what? The Viking inscriptions? The curse?
That may be so, but it's too late, isn't it? Someone's already translated the inscriptions.
(reads) We hope to return to the North Way, carrying home the oriental treasures from the Silk Lands in the east, but the dark curse follows our dragon ship.
Black fog turned day into night, and the fingers of death reached out from the waters to reclaim the treasure we have stolen.
I carve these stones in memory of Asmund, Grimvald, Torkal, Halfdan, brave Viking warriors slain by the curse.
We sought haven in Northumbria, and took refuge at a place called Maidens' Bay, but the curse of the treasure has followed us to this place. Maidens Bay?
But I've just left Ace there.
It's a translation of the Viking inscriptions. Look. And there's something I've just noticed.
Look. We hope to return to the North Way, carrying home the oriental treasure. Now, listen to this.
Vozravschayetes ve Norwegious sakrovisichem.
We return to Norway, the North Way, bearing the treasure. Now, let's see how Doctor Judson is getting along, shall we?
Doctor Judson? Something here that might interest you.
A nineteenth century translation of the Viking inscriptions, courtesy of Mister Wainwright's grandfather.
They're listening to coded German radio messages.
Ah, er, we're just being nosy.
Kathleen.
Hello.
You've got to excuse her. She's from Perivale.
Yes. Every one a heart breaker.
(sotto) Not now, Ace.
There are more effective ways. Look.
Come on.
I thought we'd have a quick recce in his office.
Extraordinary!
This is a perfect replica of the German naval cipher room in Berlin. Even down to the files. Oh, dreadful man.
Oh no, no, no, no. He's just trying to think the way the Germans think. Keep one step ahead. But he's done it so perfectly. Let's see what else they've got here. Oh dear, look at that. Pictures of cities being bombed, innocent people. Wait a minute. That's not right.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
The old school tie. It seems that Millington and Judson went to school together. That was before Judson had his accident.
Yes, why?
Well, whatever it is, it'll be down here somewhere, near where we found those papers.
What have you found?
Yes, not very pleasant. What's he holding?
Do you know what's happening here? Do you think we really killed him?
We know more than you think. Vozravschayetes ve Norwegious sakrovischem.
If, if you attack the camp now, you'll walk straight into a trap. And if you stay here, you'll die just like your comrade.
It's the only way. It's the only way to destroy the evil that's killing your men.
Whatever killed his comrade, he's seen it.
What was it? What did you see? Tell us.
Dig down, think back. Maidens Point, the undercurrents. What did you see? Shotividyo?
Calm down.
Why do I feel there's something different about this place?
What do you mean?
No, no, no, no, no! Different since we were last here.
I think it's about time we had a proper look at those inscriptions.
Can't hear a thing.
Ace, come here. Look at that. What do you notice?
Yes?
And?
And?
And it wasn't here this morning.
Quick, hide!
Those noises you heard this morning.
Shush.
Ace.
Ace!
So, this is what brought you here. A natural source of lethal poisons.
More horrible than the Well of Hvergelmir.
The Well of Hvergelmir, deep beneath the ground where broods of serpents spew their venom over the roots of the Great Ash Tree.
Shush.
Norse mythology. It seems that I've persuaded him that I'm on his side.
Hmm?
Don't antagonise him, Ace. You'd better stay here.
Only for a short time. I've got to find out what is going on, and you can find out what's wrong with Mister Wainwright.
Coming, Commander. (to Ace) Give me an hour.
The Ultima machine.
Remarkable for the nineteen forties.
For the Germans?
But they're your allies.
No, don't!
It's inhuman.
And Whitehall thinks that Moscow is careless enough to let you detonate one of those things inside the Kremlin?
And the word is?
Don't you find the Commander's orders a little peculiar sometimes, soldier?
Ah. What are you going to do with her?
I don't know.
Yes.
You haven't seen Ace at all? I'm getting a little worried.
It can translate it, but who knows what it might mean?
Ah, good. Oh, I need to have a word with your two young friends.
Yes.
Good. Back in a mo. I'm just going to requisition some transport.
Hello? Anybody home?
Looks like the one at Maidens Point. Completely drained of blood.
Stop!
Go! Go!
No, that's exactly what we won't do. He'll just go around shooting everything. No, as long as Doctor Judson doesn't work out what the inscription is, it'll keep them out of harms way. And he's a typical blinkered scientist.
Quick! We'd better stop them!
Stop the machine!
You've got to stop the machine!
Ace, the power!
Pull it! Pull it!
Just one problem. You've weakened the bases' defences precisely so some Russians could steal it.
Splendid work, Perkins. Splendid work. Now put them back together again.
We haven't got much time.
No, not vampires, haemovores. They are what Homo sapiens evolve into thousands of years in the future. Creatures with an insatiable hunger for blood.
I've seen it. How good are your parish records?
Good. Now for a little local history.
What's the matter?
Look, once upon a time you'd have dropped everything just for a little bit of excitement.
Catch us up.
Hmm?
Do you want to stay here?
Today's events haven't been written down yet. Now, you're looking for the descendants of the early Viking settlers about two hundred years ago. Ace, you help me.
The Viking inscriptions said they were carrying treasures from the Orient.
Well, just look for something evil.
The curse of Fenric, passed down through the generations.
Find out which daughters married, and what their new surnames are.
The problem is, it's not raining. There's a west wind.
Hold them! Hold them!
You've got to have faith! Have faith. Faith. Faith.
Ah. Any more up there?
Quick, you and your men, down to the crypt.
Get the record books.
Hurry up!
Jam the door.
Ah, just a little something to frighten off haemovores.
No, no, it's not the crucifix that frightens them, it's the faith of the person carrying it. It creates a psychic barrier, just like I did.
Ace?
Correct. (The Doctor opens the secret doorway.)
I can't. Either he believes absolutely, or he doesn't.
Complete faith? No doubts?
I hope we're not too late.
Oh no!
You two, break that wall down. Quick, quick!
Ace! Oh, don't antagonise her. It'll only make things worse.
Take cover!
Quick, get in the tunnel! (to Ace) I'll talk to you later.
Three or four hundred metres.
What's the matter?
Another explosion might bring the roof down on top of our heads.
No!
Two minutes, then follow us.
Where did you find that?
That's the Oriental treasure we've been looking for.
But there are two people following us.
Open those doors!
But the Russians are our friends, our allies!
The Russians aren't your problem, those creatures are. They devour humans the way you eat fruit.
They can weld metal beneath the sea with their bare hands.
Yes.
No, that's not it.
Evil. Evil since the dawn of time.
Will you stop asking me these questions?
The dawn of time. The beginning of all beginnings. Two forces only, good and evil. Then chaos. Time is born, matter, space. The universe cries out like a newborn. The forces shatter as the universe explodes outwards. Only echoes remain, and yet somehow, somehow the evil force survives. An intelligence. Pure evil!
No, that's just Millington's name for it. Evil has no name. Trapped inside a flask like a genie in a bottle.
We need to get that flask.
How?
You all right?
Come on.
Evil needs a body. It hasn't found one yet.
Don't touch him! Don't touch anything!
He's dead.
You don't have to kill her.
She's only a child!
Hurry! Come on!
What did you say over there?
Over there. You said something.
You mentioned your mum.
We're all playing games. Fenric's games. We're playing his games and falling into his traps.
I must play the game to the end this time.
A very simple game. A game of chess.
I need a chess set to play the game. I need pieces.
No, no! Don't touch!
Another of Fenric's traps.
Ha, ha, well done. The parish records. Great.
Names.
Names of ancient families. Judson, Millington, Wainwright, Dudman.
No, no, no. Millington destroyed them all.
Come on!
All part of Fenric's evil game, no doubt, like this weather.
Come on! We've got to get Kathleen's chess set.
The chess set?
Well, don't leave the hut.
That's it. No, that's not right! It was so long ago. There.
You couldn't resist it, could you? The game of traps. The contest as before. One move. Find the winning move. Spring the trap on me, if you can.
I've been waiting.
Thousands of years in the future, the Earth lies dying, the surface just a chemical slime. Half a million years of industrial progress.
You're very patient. Carried back thousands of years in a time storm, to ninth century Transylvania, and waiting till now.
Oh yes, the flask. I trapped him like an evil genie.
And so, like a faithful servant, you follow the flask.
Another of Fenric's games. He carries you back in a time storm to destroy the Earth's water with chemicals, to destroy your future. Think on it. Your Earth, your world, dying of a chemical slime. This act will be the beginning of your end.
Ace!
It can't penetrate Ace's psychic force.
Kill her.
Do you think I didn't know? The chess set in Lady Peinforte's study? I knew.
I knew. I knew she carried the evil inside her. Do you think I'd have chosen a social misfit if I hadn't known? She couldn't even pass her chemistry exams at school, and yet she manages to create a time storm in her bedroom. I saw your hand in it from the very beginning.
She's an emotional cripple. I wouldn't waste my time on her, unless I had to use her somehow.
Come on. It's over.
We've got to get out of here!
I'd have done anything not to hurt you, but I had to save you from Fenric's evil curse. Your faith in me was holding the haemovore back.
I had to make you lose your belief in me.
It's not true, believe me.
You loved the baby.
Love and hate, frightening feelings, especially when they're trapped struggling beneath the surface. Don't be frightened of the water.
Not any more. Niet.

You ready, K9?
Right. I want you to set a course of binary coordinates ten zero eleven zero zero by zero two from galactic zero centre.
Very good.
Well done, K9. Well, now we've dropped off our Earth friend we can be on our way.
Oh, yes. We can't resist a summons to Gallifrey. Anyway, I'm so looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on. You can meet your twin, K9. You know Romana, it. Romana?
You stay there, K9. You're in charge.
Ahem. Do you mind if I come in?
Yes. Well, you only came to help with the Key to Time.
Well, you can't fight Time Lords, Romana.
Hmm. And lost.
I'm afraid so.
I don't know.
K9!
Never mind about that, just give me the data.
What? There must be some data.
Well, just give me a report on all damaged parts.
What? What, none?
I don't believe it. I don't believe it! All component parts functioning normally, ha! Pah. You mean to tell me that after all we've been through, the systems are functioning perfectly?
Hmm?
Indeed we have. Let's take a look, shall we?
Oh, yes. The wilderness of outer Gallifrey. Ready to go?
Come on, it's not the end of the universe. We're home.
Oh please, don't keep apologising. Try and brighten up.
Romana!
Romana! This isn't Gallifrey.
That is Gallifrey. That is Gallifrey.
But it's absurd. It's just absurd.
Well, we can't take off until we find out precisely what's wrong with the Tardis.
Practice, practice
What?
Well, of course you heard a noise.
Who are you?
What?
Mistfall?
Mistfall?
Wrong place at the wrong time.
What?
A blue box. Really? What was it like?
Quite right. We're inside it. It's called a Tardis. This boy's not hallucinating. How's your transcendental dimensionalism? Never mind about that. Come on, K9.
Well, to the marsh. We can't stand around here theorising. The boy convinces me.
What's wrong with what?
Oh, that. Yes, that recurring image of Gallifrey. Well, it's something really quite simple. The image translator reads the absolute values of the coordinates.
Well, it's just a thought.
What do you make of this fog, K9?
Non-toxic?
They've stopped moving, K9.
Come on, let's get out of sight.
It's as if they're trying to acclimatise, which they seem to be doing rather quickly. Follow them, K9.
Let me know where they settle.
Hello?
Oh. How odd. I usually get on terribly well with children.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Gently, gently. Can't you see it's terrified?
A visitor.
Yes, but I sealed it up again. I try to leave things as they are. Shush. Come on, come on. You're all right. Come on. Everything's going to be all right. You're quite safe with me.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Leave it alone. Leave it alone. Shush, shush.
And I am the Doctor.
Look, I'm sure this ceremonial's all terribly impressive
Well, Decider Draith was dragged into the swamp. What have the marshmen got against you?
Why can't people be nice to one another, just for a change. I mean, I'm an alien, and you don't want to drag me into a swamp, do you. You do.
Well, I have a very reliable eyewitness, and then when I went to the scene of the crime
Yes.
Well, an odd smell, I agree, but definitely non-toxic.
Oh, come on. Depends on your point of view.
So am I.
Nice to meet you. Useless, you say? Listen, would you care for a second opinion?
What have you done to it?
It is?
Well, it wasn't aggressive when I met it. Anyway, it's only a baby one.
Dexeter, that's not psychodynamics. You've been taking tissue samples.
I don't understand your tasks.
Well, you're all so busy. Maintenance crews everywhere. What are you up to?
Of course. Are you leaving Alzarius?
Then if you're leaving the planet, why all the fuss about the marshmen?
Well, that's life, Dexeter.
There are? Look, isn't it time we were getting it back to its natural habitat?
Come to think of it, it's about time I got back to my own natural habitat. Haven't seen a blue box with a light on top, have you?
It's called a Tardis. It must be out there somewhere.
Oh, I think I can organise something.
Oh, it was just a hypothetical idea.
You can't always go by the manuals.
Certainly.
Can resist a sonic screwdriver, especially in expert hands.
Excuse me. Oh, what a pity. I thought it was an image translator. I need one for my ship.
Tell me, Decider Login, why are your maintenance men removing a perfectly good optronics circuit? Tell me that.
At this rate, the preparations could take years to complete.
Generations?
Yes, but too much patience goes absolutely nowhere.
Yes, I have got a vehicle and I'm feeling rather lost without it.
Really? Why would you do a thing like that?
Oh.
All right.
Good heavens! It's Romana! Romana?
What?
Romana?
Romana?
Romana? Adric! What is this, Noah's ark? Where's Romana?
Where is she, then?
What cave? Never mind!
These short trips don't usually work. And the chances of reversing a short trip are even more remote. Still, here's hopping. Would you cross your fingers?
No, no. Not like that.
No!
Very good.
Romana, are you all right?
Giant crab spiders.
You collect K9 together.
Collect that one, too. Are you sure you're all right, Romana?
She's still alive. Some kind of coma. Did you find K9's head?
No, it's not a toxin. It must be something in those spider bites, some kind of psychochemical.
How do I know? Let's get back to the science unit. I want to put some of that spider tissue under the microscope.
Stop worrying, Adric. Romana will be perfectly all right in here.
That's very good. Very good.
Dexeter!
Dexeter, you promised you wouldn't harm that marsh creature.
That's not scientific understanding, its cold-blooded murder.
Dexeter, please stop! You've no right. Please!
No, no, no. Don't! Don't! No!
Adric, go back to the Tardis and wait with Romana.
You Deciders allowed this to happen.
Yes. Easy enough to destroy. Have you ever tried creating one?
Not an alibi, Deciders! You three are supposed to be leaders.
Then Nefred is responsible.
No, no! Perhaps they haven't let you in on the secret, Login. Shall I tell him, gentlemen?
Yes! And the fraud of perpetual movement. The endless tasks going round and round. The same old components being removed and replaced.
Preparations? For what? This Starliner isn't going anywhere.
Ready? It's been made ready for centuries. Look.
This ship could take off in half an hour if you had a mind to it.
Yes! The willful procrastination of endless procedure. You want to hold onto the old order.
True.
That's certainly true.
Oh?
What's that?
What?
Well.
Oh, yes. Leucine, isoleucine, methionine. Hmm. Usual complement of amino acids. That's, that's odd. I've seen that cell shape somewhere before. What about Mistfall itself? Has anyone ever analysed that?
What? Well, so now you know.
Oh. Oh.
Yes. The mists. And then the high nitrogen content in the spider cells.
So it's difficult to judge not knowing the norm on this planet. We need some tissue samples from Dexeter and the marsh child. Well, of course. Now, what did Dexeter do with that slide?
Not now, Adric, not now!
What about Romana?
What? What?
Marshmen. In my Tardis? Come on, let's find Romana.
Come on!
It's the other half of my waistcoat. What's that?
What?
Right. No more pictures of Gallifrey, then. Come on.
You know, she could be anywhere. There must be a better way of doing it than this. We've come full circle. You know what I think
Decider?
Really? What did he say? Exactly what did he say?
Tell Dexeter we've come full circle. How's your knee, by the way?
That was quick.
Really? Rapid cellular adaptation; that settles it.
We're going back to the science unit. Come on!
No, no, no! Run and get away. Take her in the science unit.
In the science unit.
Tylos? Tylos?
Look, you've got alien protein in your brain tissue. I haven't had time to analyze it yet, but I'm sure effects are probably only temporary. Please, please, don't do that. Look, this is your problem. Think about it. Psychopathology, huh? Why are you doing this? Think about it. Look! Look, K9. You remember K9 and the Tardis. That's nice. Stay by the Tardis. Stay by the Tardis. Stay by the Tardis.
I thought I told you three to stay put.
He's dead.
Lock that door and barricade it.
Dexeter's been doing DNA analysis. Adric!
But it's other people's property. Do you think its right going around taking other people's property?
Well, if it works on the TARDIS, it would definitely prove we were in E-space.
Yes, the Exo-Space-Time Continuum, outside our own universe. I suspect that what we came through. Look, do you mind if we do one thing at a time? Good. Now for a short course in Cytogenetics.
Thank you. Oh! Tsk, tsk. Alas, poor Dexeter. Reduced to a tangle of stained chromosomes.
Yes. Well, that should put Romana to rights.
You understand? Avoid all contact. Avoid all contact. Adric! Adric, the serum!
Quick, the serum!
Good!
If it doesn't work, she's dead. How long's it supposed to be since the starliner crashed?
Forty generations. That's a good round figure. Can't be right, though.
Well, evolution goes in quantum leaps, but doesn't go that fast.
Carrier type comparisons. Yes. Definitely morphological similar carrier types. Plus the inversions in bands eight to ten might be significant. I need to establish how long the evolutionary process has taken.
From spiders to marsh creatures and beyond.
That's a good idea.
Yes. The Deciders procrastinated more than we thought.
That's not the marsh creature. That's Dexeter.
That's the marsh creature. And that's the spider.
Adric!
What?
Is he dead? Poor Varsh. Have you any more oxygen?
Which will actually make the stuff?
Splendid. Enough to fill the whole starliner?
No. No, I think we should let them go.
Look! They adapted quickly.
Yes.
Yes. Still the manuals in the great book room will show them how to put it all together again.
Yes. Just like they did forty thousand generations ago. They're your ancestors.
Oh, I don't think so. We're all basically primeval slime with ideas above its station.
Yes, I see what you mean. I suppose they are adaptive, intelligent.
Yes. The creatures most willing to survive in it.
I know you're not Terradonians. You're not marsh men either, are you? Which is what they seem to resent.
What? You mean, fly you to Terradon?
Stabiliser. Power Fuel.
Good.
Shhh. Ready? Thrusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Got it.
Which is that button there, gentlemen.
Have a good flight gentleman!
The green button gentleman!
They asked me to stay on you know, become a Decider.
Yes. I decided not too.
Oh, Adric and I were too busy to think about you.
Really? An Image Translator! Loot! He stole that. Still It might come in useful.
Yes unfortunately.
Yes that settles it. We're out of our own time and space, Romana.
Yes. What I think we came through was a Charged Vacuum Emboitment.
DOCTOR Hmmm. One of the rarest Space-Time events in the universe.
Well, they made a decision.

Now, forget your Bonapartes, your Boudiccas, your Blackbeards even.
This, Martha Jones, this is Baltazar. Scourge of the galaxy, Corsair King of Triton in the fourteenth century, the greatest despot that ever, ever lived.
Yeah, it is kind of cool. Now, the thing about Baltazar
Yeah. The most amazing thing about him is, he forged this ship himself.
By hand. Go on, tell her, Baltazar.
And not that long ago blew all of Earth's defence forces from the sky. You really shouldn't have done that.
Really? So then all carbon based life will be super-compressed in a plasma field, making
Er, precisely. Yeah, well done. Yes, every living being turned into diamonds.
Now that is a plan. That is indeed a plan.
Is that not the most incredible plan you've ever heard?
Hmm. By giving him this.
I like to stir things up.
Oh, shouldn't have done that.
That wasn't just any old spoon. That spoon passed through the hands of the greatest chefs of planet Earth. Fanny, Delia, Madame Cholette. That spoon was an antique, forged by the now extinct inhabitants of a planet that specialised in rubicola.
Oh, yes. But not just any old fungus. No, a special hydroxiling fungus. There's been no treatment for it these last two thousand years, which is why, Baltazar, scourge of the galaxy
No, I pepped it up a bit. Gave it a bit of zing, a bit of va-va-voom.
Oh, well.
Oh, I imagine so. His luck can't hold out for ever.
In this era, the most likely Prison Planet would be er, Volag-Noc. Yeah, that's where I'd take him if it were up to me. Coldest place in the galaxy.
Yup. Now, give me a number between zero and ninety nine.
And another.
Another.
Destination setting. And you, Martha Jones, have randomly chosen to take us to Copacabana beach. Ariba!
Yes! Six hundred and seventy six million miles an hour, and a bit. Rock on!
Ha! Whoa!
Oh, search me. There's nothing in the manual.
Go on, then. We've stopped.
Volag-Noc. I was right, Martha.
He eats it.
He does?
Oh, that's just a legend.
The Infinite.
Well, let's just say there are things out there in space, Martha. Things that predate our reality. Relics from the Dark Times.
Oh, far, far more than that. There was a time when the universe was so much smaller than it is now. A darker, older time of chaos. Creatures like the Racnoss, the Nestines and the Great Vampires rampaged through the void.
It's said that if anyone were to find the Infinite they'd receive their heart's desire. And frankly, that's quite a thing to receive.
It's a data chip. Part of a black box recorder. Dark Time technology.
No. The Infinite stays lost. It's nothing more than a legend. As last Custodian to the secrets of the universe it's my duty to see it stays that way.
I can't let someone like Baltazar, someone as corrupt and twisted as he is, have access to that kind of power. Caw, you'd better be right about this.
The planet Boukon? Okay, here we go.
Ah, Martha, see those? Artificial suns.
Someone wanted the planet Boukon warmed up.
Oil rigs.
It ran out on Earth. The Corporations went drilling elsewhere.
You think? Run?
Er, well, I'm open to suggestions.
How'd you do that? Oh, Martha, you're brilliant. Oh yeah, now you're just showing off. Whoa!
Pirates?
Aye, aye, Captain.
Well, that I didn't expect.
Hello there, Captain.
Hello there. I'm the Doctor. Martha and I
I told you it was the fortieth century. The last great oil corporations are sucking the solar system dry to feed demand. Petrol prices have gone through the roof, of course, and the colonies that can't afford to pay are dying.
So you're smashing the rigs, siphoning off the petrol. I see.
Or, indeed, none of the above.
No.
I don't think our Mister Swabb is all he's cracked up to be. I wonder.
So, er, sorry, let me see if I've got this right. We somehow get inside this rig that you've drained of oil and er, then what?
Oil Corp find us dead inside, boiled in oil.
Ah, ah, ah. Me first. (sotto) I thought Swabb would have made his move by now.
(sotto) He's no pirate. If he thinks we're with this Oil Corp then my guess is
(sotto) Fingers crossed. (normal) Ready.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, let us go or I'll destroy your ship.
Oh, I wish you weren't so obstinate, Kaliko. Oh, well.
Patience. Sand, in the mechanism. Hang on.
Success!
And, hold on tight.
Told you.
Thing is, Captain, Swabb here seems to think Martha and I are with Oil Corp, too.
No.
Captain, we've come here to rescue you.
Lucky they're not great shots.
Roll with it, Martha!
Aye, aye.
Oh, sorry.
Could you? Ouch, ow.
Ah.
Your earring, Captain. Do you know what it is, really?
We have to catch up with her. If Baltazar gets that data chip and finds the Infinite
No. She's been murdered.
Live by the cutlass, die by the cutlass it seems.
I'm so sorry, Kaliko. But we've got what we came for, Martha. Let's see where we're going next.
Hang on, hang on. There could be anything out there. Snakes like bendy busses, sabre toothed gorillas, anything.
Right. That way is Main Street, so that is probably Downtown.
Light?
So I see. And they're about to swarm!
They're swarming all around us.
I know.
Thank you for the timely arrival, Mister er?
Good thing the bugs listen to you.
Those are war planes.
A war zone!
You know what? I think he's got the right idea.
Martha. Martha, look out!
Pretty, isn't it?
You all right? Turns out the towers are built from dung, not rock, but even so.
Ah. Martha Jones, the Mantasphid Queen. The Mantasphid Queen Mum, Martha Jones.
Spot on. As I was saying, your Majesty, these alien attackers
Oh, military advisor, is it? Interesting euphemism for gun running.
In the crates.
Stand well back. I want to see what it is you're fighting against. Oh, what are you?
Yeah, trying to kill me. I know.
Oh. Oh, oh, Martha, you are a marvel. Calm, calm, calm, calm. Shush, shush, shush. Hey, hey, hey, I'm not going to hurt you.
Hey, shush. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Calm down, you're fine now.
What's your name, Pilot?
Well, Pilot Kelvin, what's wrong with you? Picking a fight with a bunch of defenceless bugs?
Is this true?
Killed? Why? Why did you attack?
You got well paid?
The Governor of which prison was this? Volag-Noc, perhaps?
Your Majesty, listen to me. There might still be a way.
They're going to burn us out of space and time.
We need to keep track of Meregrass. He has the datachip we need to continue this treasure hunt.
Oh, at last. Pilot Kelvin, have you got a communications system?
Oh, we'll soon have that sorted.
They are also living, sentient beings that have a right to exist. Maybe not here, but somewhere.
Ooo, that's not good.
You are brilliant! Pilot, tell them to open up a visual channel.
(Pirate) Ahoy there, ye Earth Command nobodies. You got Doctor Vile, Pilot of the Constellations given you a big white flag. Fact is, me and me mad mucker Martha here
(sotto) No, no, don't, don't do that. (Pirate) We been ruling it over these insect raiders, held their Queen here hostage. But, we have to admit, you got us beaten. Come on in and get us. We surrender! (transmission ends.) That should do it.
Taken the rap for you, Queenie. Ended your war.
Oh, you reckon?
Easy. Work with the humans, not against them. Young Kelvin here can make a great ambassador.
Now, listen, your Majesty. The human's farms will need power. Light and heat are hard to come by in an oil-starved universe, right?
Think you could make a deal?
We skedaddle out of here before Kelvin's mates arrive. Good luck, everyone.
Oh, we've found him.
Sudden dehydration. Take the datachip and let's go.
Isn't it just. But Martha, we can't stay. We're criminals, remember?
Next datachip located. It's er, ah, it's er, ooo.
Are you wearing thermals?
Come on, you.
Well, we've now met two people from the prison on Volag-Noc, right?
You were saying?
I thought you'd never get here.
We are visitors. Visitors, mind.
Oi!
Oh, that many?
It's an unfair cop.
Oh, hello. You're clearly an android, and I'm your new cellmate.
You all right?
I'm the Doctor. Tell me the trouble.
So then, anyway, Caw then said. Did I mention Caw before? Beak, metal, bird, eats gold for breakfast. Anyway, he told us that Baltazar is after the Infinite, the legendary starship that has the power to create your heart's desire. You might know Baltazar, nasty flea, used to live in this place. Anyway, we're having to chase around, stopping here
Oh, sorry, sorry. Hang on. You've been inhibited.
You couldn't commit a crime if you tried.
Then you shouldn't be here at all. Oh, I'm not having this.
Right then, we'll have to dig our way out. Don't suppose you concealed a teaspoon? I lost mine.
Hello, Martha Jones. You'll never guess who I'm with.
Oh, you guessed. The thing is, if Lok here is the Governor, who are you?
Hang on, hang on. Hold this for a moment, will you?
It's psychic.
And it tells me you're Constantine Ethelred Gurney, prisoner. Ah ha! Convicted of larceny, blackmail, fraud, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Released. Released!
Close brackets. Yeah, I get the picture.
This guy. Name of Meregrass by any chance?
Not now, Mister Lok. We did a deal.
Stop it. Stop it now. It's not their fault.
I'm on it.
Argh. Gurney, how do we stop the killing? I need to use that programme Meregrass sold you so that the warders won't take Lok's orders any more.
Gurney!
Stop!
Oh, yes. Skill. Now, where's me sonic screwdriver?
Mind, you'll do yourself a damage.
There's not.
Caw runs on gold fusion. Once his reactor's burned out, that's it.
So how'd you find us? It's very tricky to track a Tardis.
Oh, no.
An accessory to murder.
This is why you needed me, isn't it. You knew only my Tardis could track each datachip from planet to planet.
The Hesperus galaxy.
And that'll be the Caris system.
I spy asteroid seven five seven four B? Yeah, B.
This isn't a taxi!
Look, Baltazar, the Infinite, it's a myth, a legend. But even if it does exist, even if it contains a fraction of the power everyone claims, it'll consume you. Destroy you.
Yes.
Well, more or less.
Er, no.
Martha? No. No! Martha? Martha!
Hello.
Shush.
Watch out below!
Ahoy there. Meet Squawk. He's grown up now.
Haven't got the hang of landing yet.
Oi!
What do I keep on telling you? Don't listen to the villains!
Where is she? Where's Martha?
Your heart's desire.
Excuse me, I think that's my friend you're scaring.
That's up to you, I'm afraid. You conjured him up.
Heart's desire.
Oh, don't even try to find my heart's desire.
Ah. Now then, aren't you going to ask me how I got here, and hear all about my adventures on Volag-Noc? How I bottle-fed Squawk with my own gold and reprogrammed Lok to run a better prison? It's been three years, you know.
Well, two and three quarters. We gained a bit of that by flying past lightspeed, of course.
I gave Squawk's engines a bit of pep, bit of zing. bit of
Yeah.
Every pirate and freebooter and treasure hunter dreams of it and wants to find this.
Doesn't matter. Didn't work on me. Anyway, whatever power this place once had is fading away daily. The whole ship's only held together by wishes and hopes.
Not now. One of the great Old Ones was once. It died out here, alone and lost, screaming its rage and fury into the solitude until its unique power dissipated. Just left a little fading echo, enough to give us a glimpse of our heart's desire.
Oh, no.
Oh, be scourge of the galaxy again, is that the best you can think of?
He's not listening, Martha. The ship's so old and rusted, just held together by wishful thinking.
Sorry, full up. There'll be another one along in a minute.
Oh, I left him a way out.
Of course, it'd only matter if I didn't know exactly where Squawk was going to drop him off.
Searching for your heart's desire, Martha, never been all it's cracked up to be. Now then, Martha Jones, another job for you.
Yes. Start giving me some random numbers.
Come on, it'll be fun. When do I ever let you down? Ha, ha, ha, ha!

Now then. Where were we?
There now.
You see? Used the regeneration energy to heal myself, but soon as I was done, I didn't need to change. I didn't want to. Why would I? Look at me. So, to stop the energy going all the way, I siphoned off the rest into a handy bio-matching receptacle, namely my hand. My hand there. My handy spare hand. Remember? Christmas Day, Sycorax. Lost my hand in a sword fight? That's my hand. What do you think?
I'm still me.
They've got us. Power's gone. Some kind of chronon loop.
Rose, you've been in a parallel world. That world's running ahead of this universe. You've seen the future. What was it?
What?
The Dalek Crucible. All aboard.
We'll have to go out. Because if we don't, they'll get in.
Last time we fought the Daleks, they were scavengers and hybrids, and mad. But this is a fully-fledged Dalek Empire, at the height of its power. Experts at fighting Tardises, they can do anything. Right now, that wooden door is just wood.
What about your teleport?
Right then. All of us together. Yeah. Donna?
Donna?
I'm sorry. There's nothing else we can do.
It's been good, though, hasn't it? All of us. All of it. Everything we did. (to Donna) You were brilliant. (to Jack) And you were brilliant. (to Rose) And you were brilliant. Blimey.
Donna! You're no safer in there.
What?
It wasn't me. I didn't do anything.
What did you do?!
Stop it! She's my friend. Now open the door and let her out.
Me? The door just closed on its own.
What are you doing? Bring it back!
What have you done? Where's it going?
You can't. You've taken the defences down. It'll be torn apart!
Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything! Put me in her place. You can do anything to me, I don't care, just get her out of there!
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Rose, come here. Leave him.
I know. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do.
All repaired. Lovely. Shush. No one knows we're here. Got to keep quiet. Silent running, like on submarines when you can't even drop a spanner. Don't drop a spanner! I like blue. What do you think?
Why? What's wrong with blue?
No, no, no, no, no. I'm unique. Never been another like me. Because all that regeneration energy went into the hand. Look at my hand. I love that hand. But then you touched it. Wham! Shush. Instantaneous biological metacrisis. I grew out of you. Still, could be worse.
Oi, watch it, Earth girl. Ooo. I sound like you. I sound all, all sort of rough.
Oi!
Spanners. Shush. I must have picked up a bit of your voice, that's all. Is it? Did I? No. Oh, you are kidding me. No way. One heart. I've only got one heart. This body has got only one heart.
Oh, that's disgusting.
Oi!
No, wait. I'm part Time Lord, part human. Well, isn't that wizard?
Oh, that was me. My single heart. Because I'm a complicated event in time and space. Must have rippled back, converging on you.
Because you're special.
No, but you are. Oh. You really don't believe that, do you? I can see, Donna, what you're thinking. All that attitude, all that lip, because all this time you think you're not worth it.
Shouting at the world because no one's listening. Well, why should they?
But look at what you did. No, it's more than that. It's like we were always heading for this. You came to the Tardis. And you found me again. Your granddad. Your car. Donna, your car. You parked your car right where the Tardis was going land. That's not coincidence at all! We've been blind. Something's been drawing us together for such a long time.
It's still not finished. It's like the pattern's not complete. The strands are still drawing together. But heading for what?
Still scared of me, then?
No, no, no, no, no. We're not doing the nostalgia tour. I want to know what's happening right here, right now, because the Supreme Dalek said Vault, yeah? As in dungeon, cellar, prison. You're not in charge of the Daleks, are you? They've got you locked away down here in the basement like, what, a servant? Slave? Court jester?
No, no, no, no, no. No, I've got the word. You're the Dalek's pet!
Leave her alone.
You've met before. The last of the Cult of Skaro. But it flew into the Time War, unprotected.
Was it you, Caan? Did you kill Donna? Why did the Tardis door close? Tell me!
What does that mean?
Testing of what?
It's the planets. The twenty seven planets.
That's Z-neutrino energy, flattened by the alignment of the planets into a single string. No, Davros. Davros, you can't! You can't! No!
Single string Z-neutrinos compressed. No way.
The twenty seven planets. They become one vast transmitter, blasting that wavelength.
It's our only hope. A Z-neutrino biological inversion catalyser.
Davros said he built those Daleks out of himself. His genetic code runs through the entire race. If I can use this to lock the Crucible's transmission onto Davros himself
Biggest backfire in history.
Put me through.
Stop saying that. Put me through!
Osterhagen what? What's an Osterhagen Key?
What? Who invented that? Well, someone called Osterhagen, I suppose. Martha, are you insane?
That's never an option.
And Mickey. Captain, what are you doing?
You can't! Where did you get a Warp Star?
They're trying to help.
Who was that?
Don't move, all of you. Stay still.
Do as he says.
You can't, Davros! Just listen to me! Just stop!
Ready? Maximum power!
But that's
Don't!
Donna! Donna! Are you all right, Donna?
Human biological metacrisis. Never mind that. Now we've got no way of stopping the Reality Bomb.
Donna, you can't even change a plug.
How did you work that out? You're
Time Lord. Part Time Lord.
The Doctor Donna. Just like the Ood said, remember? They saw it coming. The Doctor Donna.
What did you do?
But that's brilliant!
Why did we never think of that?
Ha!
Off you go, Clom.
Back home, Adipose Three.
Ha!
We need more power!
You're so unique the timelines were converging on you. Human being with a Time Lord brain.
Oh, I think he did. Something's been manipulating the timelines for ages, getting Donna Noble to the right place at the right time.
Oh, we've lost the magnetron. And there's only one planet left. Oh, guess which one. But we can use the Tardis.
Holding Earth stability. Maintaining atmospheric shell.
He's right. Because with or without a Reality bomb, this Dalek Empire's big enough to slaughter the cosmos. They've got to be stopped.
I am the Doctor. Maximising Dalekanium power feeds. Blasting them back!
What have you done?
Fulfilling the prophecy.
Do you know what you've done? Now get in the Tardis! Everyone! All of you, inside! Run!
In! In! In! In!
Sarah Jane! Rose! Jackie! Jack! Mickey!
Davros? Come with me. I promise I can save you.
And off we go.
I'm on it. Torchwood Hub, this is the Doctor. Are you receiving me?
Can't get rid of him. Jack, what's her name?
Tell me, Gwen Cooper,
Are you from an old Cardiff family?
Ah, thought so. Spatial genetic multiplicity.
Yeah, it's a funny old world. Now, Torchwood, I want you to open up that
Rift Manipulator. Send all the power to me.
It's a tow rope. Now then. Sarah, what was your son's name?
Calling Luke and Mister Smith.
This is the Doctor. Come on, Luke. Shake a leg.
Oh, she's fine and dandy.
Now, Mister Smith, I want you to harness the Rift power and loop it around the Tardis. You got that?
Oh, blimey, that's going to take a while.
Oh! Oh ho! Oh, good dog!
K9, give Mister Smith the base code.
Now then, you lot. Sarah, hold that down. Mickey, you hold that. Because you know why this Tardis always is always rattling about the place? Rose? That, there. It's designed to have six pilots, and I have to do it single handed. Martha, keep that level. But not any more. Jack, there you go. Steady that. Now we can fly this thing. No, Jackie. No, no. Not you. Don't touch anything. Just stand back. Like it's meant to be flown. We've got the Torchwood Rift looped around the Tardis by Mister Smith, and we're going to fly Planet Earth back home. Right then. Off we go.
I told you, no teleport. And, Martha, get rid of that Osterhagen thing, eh? Save the world one more time.
Oi, where are you going?
What will you do?
Just time for one last trip. Drlig Ulv Stranden. Better known as
Oh, brilliant. What did you call him?
Really?
You're back home.
But you've got to. Because we saved the universe, but at a cost. And the cost is him. He destroyed the Daleks. He committed genocide. He's too dangerous to be left on his own.
You made me.
Exactly. You were born in battle, full of blood and anger and revenge. Remind you of someone? That's me, when we first met. And you made me better. Now you can do the same for him.
He needs you. That's very me.
I look like him and I think like him. Same memories, same thoughts, same everything. Except I've only got one heart.
I'm part human. Specifically, the aging part. I'll grow old and never regenerate. I've only got one life, Rose Tyler. I could spend it with you, if you want.
Together.
We've got to go. This reality is sealing itself off for ever.
And I'm him.
I said, Rose Tyler.
Does it need saying?
And how do you know that?
And how does that feel?
Do you know what's happening?
There's never been a human Time Lord metacrisis before now. And you know why.
Look at me. Donna, look at me.
I know.
Donna. Oh, Donna Noble. I am so sorry. But we had the best of times.
The best. Goodbye.
Help me.
She took my mind into her own head. But that's a Time Lord consciousness. All that knowledge, it was killing her.
I had to wipe her mind completely. Every trace of me, or the Tardis, anything we did together, anywhere we went, had to go.
I know. But that version of Donna is dead. Because if she remembers, just for a second, she'll burn up. You can never tell her. You can't mention me or any of it for the rest of her life.
It'll just be a story. One of those Donna Noble stories, where she missed it all again.
I just want you to know there are worlds out there, safe in the sky because of her. That there are people living in the light, and singing songs of Donna Noble, a thousand million light years away. They will never forget her, while she can never remember. And for one moment, one shining moment, she was the most important woman in the whole wide universe.
Then maybe you should tell her that once in a while.
John Smith.
Donna? I was just going.
Ah. You'll have quite a bit of this. Atmospheric disturbance. Still, it'll pass. Everything does. Bye then, Wilfred.
They've all got someone else. Still, that's fine. I'm fine.
You can't ever tell her.
Thank you.

Well, Peri, what do you think?
Oh, never mind about the clothes, they're easily changed. What about me?
Sorry? I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not people, Peri. I happen to be me.
Natural metamorphosis. A form of rebirth. I call it a renewal, and this time, positive triumph. I can sense it in every fibre of my being.
My outward appearance is of no importance whatsoever.
Very well, if you insist.
Ah. A noble brow. Clear gaze. At least it will be, given a few hours sleep. A firm mouth. A face beaming with a vast intelligence. My dear child, what on Earth are you complaining about?
It's the most extraordinary improvement.
My last incarnation. I was never happy with that one.
It had a sort of feckless charm, which simply wasn't me.
Sweet? Effete. Sweet? Sweet? Sweet? Huh, that says it all.
Oh, but this has been a timely change. Change. What change? There is no change. No rhyme, no time.
No place for space. Nothing. Nothing but the grinding engines of the universe, the crushing boredom of eternity.
Hmm? No.
My dear child, stop worrying. Try to understand. Regeneration in my case is a swift but volcanic experience. A kind of violent biological eruption in which the body cells are displaced, changed, renewed and rearranged.
There are bound to be side-effects.
Hmm? Oh, may indeed, but each time with diminishing effect. You have nothing to fear.
Well, if you find it so upsetting, that would be the most sensible thing to do. Ah ha!
I'm always serious.
Why ever not?
My dear, that is what people said about Beau Brummell. Remember him?
And I don't?
Hmm? Yuck.
Vesta Ninety Five.
You'll soon find out. It's a marvellous place for a holiday, and you and I both need a rest. I would have taken you to the Eye of Orion, but er, the coordinates elude me at the moment. Peri.
How did you come by a name like that?
Indeed.
Of course you don't. You don't even know what a peri (pronounced peeri) is, do you, Peri?
I'll tell you. A peri is a good and beautiful fairy in Persian mythology. The interesting thing is, before it became good, it was evil. And that's what you are. Thoroughly evil.
No. No, not even a fairy. An alien spy, sent here to spy on me. Well, we all know the fate of alien spies.
What happened?
I don't have fits.
I told you, manic moments of no consequence. They become less dramatic and less and less frequent.
Don't exaggerate.
I must admit I am a little hazy.
Oh, don't be absurd.
What you say is impossible. I have an inbuilt resistance to any form of violence, except in self-defence.
I don't? Upon my word, you really are frightened, aren't you.
Something's wrong. Something's very wrong. Oh no, has it come to that? Regenerate, yet unregenerate. Oh, alas, poor Peri. Not for us the pleasures of Vesta Ninety Five.
I am a living peril to the universe. If this poor hive is to be cleansed, there's only one recourse. Contemplation. Self-abnegation in some hellish wilderness. Ten days, ten years, a thousand years! Of what consequence is time to me? I shall become a hermit, and you, child, shall be my disciple. I know the very place. An asteroid so desolate. Titan Three is where I shall repent!
Titan Three. Thou craggy knob, which swims upon the oceans of the firmament. Receive this weary penitent.
Hmm?
And why should you be sorry?
Yes?
Never more so. I've no need to remind you. Now, a hermit needs a hermitage. You and I, Peri, must find one.
Far too good. Quite useless for contemplation. No, what we need is a cave, some utterly comfortless place where you and I can suffer together.
Because you have been chosen. It shall be your humble privilege to minister unto my needs. They will be very simple. But nothing must be allowed to interfere with my period of contemplation.
I was speaking figuratively. It shouldn't come to that. Come along, we're wasting time.
We must! I must atone for what I have done!
Huh? The instruments say otherwise. The atmosphere, what there is of it, is breathable.
I think we should find out.
Of course it's dangerous. We could be blown to pieces at any minute.
Then stay behind. This is work for heroes, not for faint-hearted girls. So, no one could have lived through it, eh? Well, here's one who did. You would have left one of your own kind to die.
Yes. Small thanks to you. Poor pusillanimous Peri. What a pitiful performance.
What do you mean?
Peri!
He was going to kill me, Peri.
Peri!
Quite beside the point. For all you seem to care, I could be lying dead at your feet this very moment.
Easily, but I'm not going to.
You never cease to amaze me. All you're asking me to do is revive a man who had every intention of murdering me.
If it's a question of his life or mine, I certainly can.
Oh, a sort of policeman.
I wouldn't like to count on it. Oh, all right, have it your own way. Fetch the medical kit.
Post-operative shock occluded, wounds closed, no internal haemorrhage. This deep healing beam's a small marvel. Great improvement on the old laser scalpel. Did you hide the powerpack to his gun well?
Excellent. Oh, the satisfaction, Peri, knowing one has saved the life of a brave young man.
Are you questioning my skill?
Oh. In that case, the short answer is yes.
His heartbeat's slow but steady as a drum. An hour's rest, he'll be right as rain, whatever that means. An hour. An hour to kill. How to turn it to account? We must make plans, Peri. My full powers are returning.
My perception's sharpening. I can sense some massive danger threatening the universe.
Me?
Words spoken in the sickness of transition. Now, there is a sickness in the air. I can feel the vibrations. I cannot yet detect their source, but it is there. I am never wrong. The life force itself is in danger of extinction. We must find this evil and destroy it.
Yes. Yes, that is the problem. It's odd, Peri. The indications are very strong. I think the clue we need is here on Titan Three. That's it, of course, the children.
He said something about children.
An interplanetary spaceman on a mission. His spacecraft crashes, he talks about children. Abducted children. That's it, Peri. Children of great importance kidnapped by aliens, brought here to Titan Three, held for a king's ransom.
It's nothing of the kind.
There wasn't. But we're here, he's here. Things change, Peri.
Hmm, what's that?
That.
That.
A bump? A bump? A bump? That is something which has no business on an uninhabited asteroid. Look at that symmetry. That's no part of nature's handiwork.
Quite a distance. Let's get going.
What's a little radiation when we have a purpose, a mission in life?
Brave heart, Tegan. Tegan?
Yes, of course.
Don't worry, Peri. I won't be putting your life at any risk. Or mine either, for that matter. This is just a simple reconnaissance.
Who? Oh. Oh, the patient. Well, don't worry, he'll still be here when we get back. Come along, Peri. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
The shades of night were falling fast, as through an alpine village passed, a youth, who bore midst snow and ice, a banner with a strange device.
I was only trying to cheer you up. One of your primitive American versemakers. Longfellow, wasn't it?
Courage, Peri. Just follow in my footsteps. Aprs nous, le deluge!
Right on course. Hello? Perhaps a way to enter the dome undetected.
Would you rather I went round and knocked on the front door? I'm a Knight Errant, not an errant fool.
To our destiny.
Peri, quickly. Now what did I tell you? Listen.
The perpetual cry of all cowards. We must investigate.
Worse? Yes. Yes, well, perhaps you're right. The purpose of reconnaissance, after all, is to gather information, not to finish up face down in a pool on one's own blood. Especially blood as noble as mine. We've found out what we want to know.
What?
Yes. Yes, of course, but, well, children are such survivors. Besides, we have only the words of a delirious man that there are any children.
An unthinking act of foolish bravado. You know my current state of mind.
No, Peri. Discretion is always the better part of valour. We should return to the Tardis and rethink the situation.
Whatever is it now? Aliens? No, no. No, no, don't shoot. It's not my fault. I'm just a poor pilgrim. It's all her fault. Mercy, mercy, mercy. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.
Look, I'm sure we can sort this out amicably.
Look, none of this is my fault. I'm the innocent party. It's all her fault. She's forever leading me off the straight and narrow.
And kindly refrain from addressing me as Doc, Perpugilliam.
Some of this technology looks familiar.
Hmm? Oh, my sincere apologies. A momentary lapse. I am now in total control. Leave everything to me.
But I can. We are in no sense survivors. We came to Titan Three of our own free will.
Pilgrims, in search of peace.
Silence, wretch!
Yes. And pilgrims need a place in which to meditate. We were searching for a cave when we happened to stumble into your service duct.
My disciple.
A most devout young person. Now sir, whoever you are, I demand a full explanation of this disgraceful treatment. Now there's a face that floats upon my memory. Impossible. I'm hallucinating. As I live and breathe, Azmael, you old dog!
What in the name of wonder are you doing here? Peri, he's my old friend and mentor, the Master of Jaconda.
Oh, forgive me, old friend. Of course you don't recognise me. I've regenerated twice since our last meeting. Look, the twin hearts that beat as one? I'm a Time Lord, just as you are, and in case you still pretend not to know who I am, let me remind you. The last night I stayed, that last night, when you drank like twenty giants and I had to push you in the fountain to sober you up.
Thank heaven. For a minute you almost had me worried there. You don't seem overjoyed.
Then why don't you?
Earthlings. Children. By heaven, Peri, I was right.
I see. You abduct these children, deprive them of their memories, bring them to this screaming wilderness and won't disclose your motives? That hardly sounds in character.
Oh, what's time to us? You're in trouble, Azmael, grave trouble.
Don't be absurd. You and I together? What an infallible combination.
What does that mean?
As prisoners?
Poor fellow. He's not a bit like that really.
No, Peri, a few days at most.
That's what I mean. It may take even me a few days. Well, no time like the present. Let's get started.
It's vital you don't interrupt the sequence.
All right, all right, I'm coming.
Hmm? Oh, no. He can't, he wouldn't have. We haven't got a few days, or even a few hours. In fact, we haven't got that many minutes.
That I can't switch off.
Not yet. It means we've got to find another way out of here, and very quickly indeed.
Eureka! I can do it, Peri. I can do it.
That should do the trick.
I'll be brief. I must be very brief. That is known as a revitalising modulator. It breaks down your molecular structure and puts it back together again. A most refreshing process. Until now, that's the only purpose it's served. I have improvised. It will take you back in time.
Ten seconds, to be precise. You'll find yourself in the Tardis.
Absolutely. In you get. Oh, no, wait a minute. Awkward. I won't be able to see the computer clock when it's my turn and I need to be able to compensate for the time factor so I arrive back at the Tardis at the same time as you do. Your watch, Peri. Lend me your watch. Come on, quickly. Now, when I stand clear, press the internal button. Do hurry, Peri. In precisely one minute I'm going to be blown to pieces.
It worked! It actually worked!
Oh no, it's stopped.
That stupid girl's watch. How I hate these hit or miss performances.
Your watch stopped. I over-compensated, ended up in the wrong time zone, ten seconds into your future.
You cared?
You know, I'll never understand the people of Earth. I have spent the day using, abusing, even trying to kill you. If you'd have behaved as I have, I should have been pleased at your demise.
Earthlings.
Ah, Corporal Lang, how are you?
You were lucky to escape. No one else did.
And we did not abduct the twins.
Never mind about that now. Look, do put that thing away, will you? If you ever hope to see them again, your only chance is to come with us.
Well, at a guess, Jaconda.
Not really.
I don't know.
No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Look, consider what we know. Azmael, or whatever he happens to call himself, need the genius of the twins. He crosses galaxies to possess their minds. He says he's no longer master of his planet, but he wants to save his people, and that I cannot help him to do so! Well, if he really does believe such unimaginable rubbish, he must be faced by some unimaginable disaster which has unhinged his mind. Well, we shall soon discover what it is.
Jaconda the beautiful.
Oh, no. Let it not be true.
The giant gastropods.
Half humanoid, half slug. Part of Jacondan mythology.
Just look around you. Look at the devastation.
What else?
Of course not. So, it wasn't a myth after all. Somewhere, somehow, their seed survived, and now they have returned.
You think so?
I wish I could agree with you. This was once a forest grove. Look at the trees. Not a trace of foliage. The very bark stripped from the trunks. And the soil, barren. Nothing but these tell-tale tracks, the slime trails of the giant gastropods. I fear the evidence is quite conclusive.
I'm beginning to scare myself, Peri.
Into the Tardis. I must think.
Panic at any moment.
The palace.
And be killed?
Me, afraid?
You have a nasty habit of pinpointing the truth, young man.
Watch me.
Well then, let him go to the palace and he'll know as much as I do.
Oh, is this another attempt to teach me compassion?
Oh, it's all right for you. You're young, strong, fit of limb. You're confident in your mission, your energy's boundless, you're highly motivated to success. You even have a gun to enforce your will upon others. But look at me. I'm old, lacking in vigour. My mind's in a turmoil. I no longer know if I'm coming, have gone or have even been. I'm falling to pieces. I no longer even have any clothes sense.
Self-pity is all I have left.
As you wish.
Well, you didn't expect me to materialise in the throne room?
Anywhere.
I'll come with you.
You didn't give me much choice. Now look, Sergeant.
Lieutenant.
Don't be smug with me. Now, I've already explained my condition. I may be behaving like a manic barometer, but don't shrug off help when it's offered. You can't afford to.
So's most currency. Doesn't stop people spending money wisely.
Hideous. Utterly hideous.
Hmm? Oh, absolutely. Azmael showed me once. This passage leads to the centre of the palace. Used to be an underground bolt-hole in times of danger. Seems to be clear. Shall we go?
Oh, there's every possibility of that.
This way, come along. Ah, there we are. I don't know how old they are, but they tell the whole story.
The Queen of Jaconda offended the Sun God. This way. He inflicted a terrible revenge. He sent a creature, half humanoid, half slug. This creature's offspring were numberless. They ravaged the planet. The population starved. When he saw what he'd done, the Sun God relented. He sent a drought, which destroyed the slugs. The people of Jaconda survived. Well, that's the story as Azmael related it.
It was more truth than myth. I think some dormant egg survived.
Too long, it seems. Switch off the torch. Listen.
The sound of giant slugs.
Their gastric tracts. Rotting vegetables.
Whatever is it now?
Oh no, I should have thought of that. Their slime trails harden like concrete, only far faster.
Easier said than done.
Oh, if you like, but try not to burn your feet off.
Now, let me see. We follow this passage to the end, flight of steps up to the palace hall, doorway at the left just before the top. Yes, that's it. Private doorway to the back of his laboratory. That's where he's bound to be.
What?
Me, once I can get away from this fool. Will you hurry up?
Well, it's not good enough. Oh, look what you've done, you stupid girl. You've ruined everything!
Of course it was your fault. Sheer carelessness, switching off the torch when you did. Don't argue with me.
Manic depressive? Me?
Right, that's it, I'm off.
Calm down? Calm down? Calm down? The fate of a whole planet is hanging in the balance and he tells me to calm down?
Oh, fend for yourselves.
Azmael, Edgeworth
Still bullying children, eh?
Villain! Murderer!
A thousand murrains on your head.
I apologise. However, I still would like to know why you tried to murder us.
Oh, that doesn't matter now. I think you'd better tell me what's going on here.
You really intend to put it into operation? You know what will happen, don't you?
This is not a risk, Azmael, this is Doomsday. One tiny error in your calculation, you'll blow a small hole in the universe!
Peri? They'll kill her!
Leave me! I must go to her!
But I must help her.
No. Peri!
How? The very core of my being is on fire with guilt and rage. How is he?
Peri, you're alive!
It's debatable who the fool is, if you intend to blow up this corner of the universe.
Not at all. In fact, if I can hold my mind together, I might even be able to help you.
Well, moving planets around is not for amateurs, you know. I mean, the twins may have the mathematical skills, but I have the empirical knowledge. The practical experience that can guarantee success. I mean, one tiny error in your calculations, the planets you're trying to shift could fly off in any direction.
You should know. I can sense your presence in my mind.
I'm secretive by nature. Besides, if you were to learn everything too quickly, you'd have no reason to keep me alive.
Good heavens. You are rather hot-tempered.
I've agreed to help you.
With this ridiculous scheme of Mestor's.
And how do you think the Lord Mestor would feel about that?
Embolism, isn't it? Let me tell you. Little tiny bubbles go very well in champagne and purgatives, Noma, but not in the blood.
Have you got fowl pest?
How does Mestor plan to bring the other two planets into the same orbit as Jaconda.
Well, how will he stabilise Jaconda? Three planets in the same orbit will exert enormous gravitational pressure on each other.
Very neat.
What?
Of course I'm all right. I'm certainly all right. It's the situation that's all wrong.
Both the outer planets are smaller than Jaconda.
Well, so is the consequence if they're brought any nearer the Jacondan sun.
Your mind was on other things, my friend.
A matter of simple physics. The gravitational pull of the sun on Jaconda is more or less consistent, yes?
The outer planets are smaller. Place them where Jaconda is, how long do you think they'll last?
Of course.
I don't know, but there's method to his madness, of that I'm certain. In the meantime, carry on with your calculations. We don't want to arouse Mestor's suspicions.
Then who am I?
See it more as a mental stroll in a park of psychic tranquillity.
Who? Oh. Oh, very good. Excellent. Ten out of ten. Alpha plus.
Interesting. Gastropod eggs.
Is it possible to get into the hatchery?
I sense the answer is in there. Azmael?
Of course.
Excellent.
Now, the answer must be in here somewhere. Mestor hasn't gone to all this trouble. The egg of a slug. But where's the mucus? The jelly, the food that feeds the young within?
Of course. These eggs are dry and rubbery. Let's see what's inside. A laser cutter. I must have a laser cutter.
I don't know, but something's wrong.
Ah!
It should at least have scratched the surface.
How indeed?
Precisely what it's supposed to do, only it isn't anything like hot enough yet.
Are these all the eggs?
So many. Ah, it all begins to make sense.
They were designed to withstand the temperatures of an exploding sun.
Mestor's colonisation is not of this planet, but the universe.
It's so simple, it's mind-boggling. Of course it could work.
Right, what we need is a plan of action. Now, you've still got your gun. Take Peri and the twins back to the safety of the Tardis.
Then deal with them. You are supposed to be an Interplanetary Pursuit Officer.
Deal with Mestor.
I am fully alert and ready for action.
Better we die in harness, battling against the odds, than die in fear, finding menace in our own shadows.
Can you carry them in your head?
Then destroy all the notes you've made.
Good. Drak, you go back to the Tardis with the others.
Mestor!
There's no time to waste. Check the corridor.
Now, back to the Tardis. Be careful and good luck.
Such a nice girl. Hope I see her again.
Yeah.
Ah, there you are. I've been looking for you.
I've worked out what you're up to and it's got to stop.
I'm not having your sluggy eggs spread all over the universe, causing havoc. Nor will I allow you to destroy what was once a very beautiful planet.
Did I threaten him? Did you hear me threaten him?
Watch it, Mestor!
I'm the one who's doing the warning. Now, will you give up this nonsense?
Then take the consequence!
No, just a rotten shot.
Indigestion? Or is it bad news?
Perhaps your plan to recapture the twins has failed.
Be careful of Lieutenant Lang. He's been dying to kill someone ever since he got here, and after all, you did destroy his entire squadron. Earthlings have an unquenchable thirst when it comes to revenge.
Oh, thought we'd come to that. Embolism time, is it? Oh, don't tell me. My blood will bubble like a raging stream? I will beg to die? And in so doing I will crave your indulgence and forgiveness?
Good, because in my time I have been threatened by experts. I don't rate you very highly at all.
Ha! I don't blame you.
You? Take over my mind? Ha! It would be like throwing a pebble into a lake. It will sink without trace.
A Jacondan mind, maybe, but I am a Time Lord.
Indeed.
Azmael?
That's not fair. He's an old man.
Well, why don't you try?
We must mind-link. Together we can destroy him.
I can contain him.
You can't. You've used up your allotted number of lives.
You fool, why did you do it?
You should have left him to me.
But to throw away your own life?
Oh, you had so much to give. You were the finest teacher I ever had.
Azmael. Azmael. I shall miss you, old friend. I shall indeed.
Sorry about that.
Of course not.
Do I look otherwise?
I'll take you all.
Wait a minute, I remember you. You're the Chamberlain.
I don't like you.
Then I suggest you start walking. Right, let's get you and the twins back to Earth.
They'll survive.
Well, certainly not that thing. Neither will Azmael, he's dead.
They're quite capable of looking after themselves. Listen.
They've already started mopping up.
As you wish. Although I think you're mad.
That I can believe.
To whom?
You may not believe this, but I have fully stabilised.
You seem to forget, Peri, I'm not only from another culture but another planet. I am, in your terms, an alien. I am therefore bound to different values and customs.
At such a cost. I was on the verge of becoming neurotic.
And I would suggest, Peri, that you wait a little before criticising my new persona. You may well find it isn't quite as disagreeable as you think.
Whatever else happens, I am the Doctor, whether you like it or not.

Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both of you. Together.
And then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty of all time.
Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides.
And the key to perfect negotiation?
Not knowing what side you're on.
So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out
No one in this room will be able to remember if they're human
Or Zygon.
Whoops-a-daisy!
Hello, it's Doctor Disco. I'm in the twenty first century. I don't know what month. I'm staking out some of the most dangerous creatures imaginable.
Operating under deep cover. Trying not to attract suspicion. Give me a call, Clara. Nightmare Scenario. I'm worried.
Okay. Hey, Monster High and Cinderella. Down off the monkey bars. Listen to me. We've got to talk.
Look, I admire you, okay? I think you're ingenious. Pretending to be a couple of seven year olds is a splendid way to conceal your blobbiness. But let's not pretend. You're very blobby. In fact, you two are the big blobs. And you are not patrolling the ceasefire.
Fine. Fine, bury your heads. Listen to me. Listen! There are other factions. I know that there are other blobby factions that you don't control. They're planning something. And if we don't get together and stop it, it'll be the end of this. Of all of you.
Your kids are out of control. I'm taking this out of your hands.
Don't even think about going anywhere.
Are you phoning me with your backside again, or are you really sending me a distress signal?
Hey! Away! Away! Get those kids out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Move! Out of the way!
Call me now.
Hello, it's Doctor Disco.
Yes, I know. It's called peace. What about the two little girl commanders? Weren't they helping you?
The Zygon command centre. That's the control polyp for all Zygons on Earth.
Could you? Would you mind? Thank you.
If this has been compromised, the Zygons are wide open. They'll be starting to panic. Starting to worry.
It's a command computer. You operate it by titivating the fronds.
I snogged a Zygon once. Old habits.
Still got the old magic.
Both of them.
Both of them. They would have maintained a live link. They were both Zygon and human at the same time. They not only administered the peace, they
Ah ha! Okay. Zygons hatched and dispersed all over, but something's gone wrong. Mexico border, North Asia, West Africa, Australia. Panic. Paranoia. What would happen if they knew who we were?
So, we have a Zygon revolution on our hands. We need to open negotiations.
Isn't there a solution that doesn't involve bombing everyone?
This is a splinter group. The rest of the Zygons, the vast majority, they want to live in peace. You start bombing them, you'll radicalise the lot. That's exactly what the splinter group wants.
Okay. Kate Stewart, no bombs for you. Go to Truth Or Consequences. See what you can find out. The Doctor will go to Turmezistan. Negotiate peace, rescue Osgood, and prevent this war, cos that's what he does. Clara, Jac, you stay here. This is your country. Protect it from the scary monsters. And also from the Zygons.
Oh, and do you still have the presidential aircraft?
No, but I like poncing about in a big plane.
At ease. I'm the President of the World. I'm here to rescue people and generally establish happiness all over the place. The Doctor. Doctor Funkenstein.
What's going on here? Fun and games?
You're not bombing that town. That's where they're holding my friend.
Colonel.
Well, that's interesting.
So, that's what we'll find out.
Colonel, take it easy. They're trying to unsettle you. They're trying to make you paranoid and panicked.
This is our object. We need to get her back, safely. Try to kill as few of them as possible. I need have to have someone to negotiate with.
This is pointless! Just let me go in and talk!
Where are the Zygons?
I'm not going to let you do that.
I need to find Osgood.
Osgood! Osgood!
Osgood!
Osgood!
Osgood!
Osgood!
Got to get you out. They're going to bomb this place. What do the Zygons want?
Rescuing you. In quite a dashing way, I might add.
Clara.
Oh, hello.
They've started. So much for ten minutes.
Can you change your voicemail message, please, it's getting very boring.
Oh, I see you've accessorised it.
The old question marks.
Oh, I know, yes, I did.
Oh, I do. I've got question mark underpants.
Which one are you? Human or Zygon?
Why not?
Like a hybrid.
Well, I'm proud to know you, Osgood. And I promise that I won't tell anyone that you're a human. Zygons need to keep the human original alive to refresh the body print. If you were a Zygon, you'd've changed back within days of your sister's death.
Bit of first-things-first-ness. What's your name? My name's. Well, you can call me the Doctor. But then you knew that, didn't you? You want something. What is it?
I suppose so.
Well, you can't have the United Kingdom. There's already people living there. They'll think you're going to pinch their benefits.
Really. Clara?
Clara?
Clara, I'm glad you're okay. Listen.
The invasion has happened. You're probably surrounded by Zygons. Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe.
And apparently my plane is never going to land, but let's see what we're going to do about that.
Clara!

Move yourself, boy. Back to the school, quickly.
What about you?
Mister Hicks, warn the village. Get everyone out. Latimer, get back to the school. Tell the headmaster
Maybe one man can't fight them, but this school teaches us to stand together. Take arms! Take arms!
You want me to fight, don't you? Take arms! Take arms!
Enemy at the door, Hutchinson. Enemy at the door. Take arms!
Redfern, maintain position over the stable yard. Faster now. That's it.
They're cadets, Miss Jones. They are trained to defend the King and all his citizens and properties.
Headmaster, I have to report the school is under attack.
No, I promise you, sir. I was in the village with Matron. It's Baines, sir. Jeremy Baines and Mister Clark from Oakham Farm. They've gone mad, sir. They've got guns. They've already murdered people in the village. I saw it happen.
Well, sir, they said
Hold me. Keep me safe. Keep me dark. Keep me closed. The time is not right. Not yet. Not while the Family is abroad. Danger!
Honestly, sir, I have no idea. And the telephone line's been disconnected. We are on our own.
Stables in case of
Lockley, when firing commences, you're in charge of the gallery.
You're with Armitage and Thwaites. They know the drill. Joan, it's not safe.
Not quite as planned.
Sorry?
Well, it lies on the River Leen, its southern boundary following the course of the River Trent which flows from Stoke to the Humber.
Broadmoor Street. Adjacent to Hotley Terrace in the district of Radford Parade.
How can you think that I'm not real? When I kissed you, was that a lie?
But this Doctor sounds like some, some romantic lost prince. Would you rather that? Am I not enough?
I've got to go.
What choice do I have?
She was, she was with, with Baines in the village.
Put down your guns.
I'll not see this happen. Not anymore. You will retreat in an orderly fashion back through the school. Hutchinson, lead the way.
I said, lead the way.
Let's go. Quick as you can.
And you, ladies.
Now, I insist. The pair of you, just go. If there are any more boys inside, I'll find them.
I think, retreat.
I've never seen it in my life.
I'm not. I'm John Smith. That's all I want to be. John Smith, with his life, and his job, and his love. Why can't I be John Smith? Isn't he a good man?
Why can't I stay?
What am I, then? Nothing. I'm just a story.
We've got to keep going.
I must go to them, before anyone else dies.
You're this Doctor's companion. Can't you help? What exactly do you do for him? Why does he need you?
And that's what you want me to become.
I won't.
Stop it.
Stop it! I said stop it.
Those are just stories.
The watch.
I think he's asleep. Waiting to awaken.
Oh, low level telepathic field. You were born with it. Just an extra synaptic engram causing. Is that how he talks?
You knew this all along and yet you watched while Nurse Redfern and I
Falling in love? That didn't even occur to him?
Then what sort of man is that? And now you expect me to die?
So your job was to execute me.
I should have thought of it before. I can give them this. Just the watch. Then they can leave and I can stay as I am.
If they want the Doctor, they can have him.
If they get what they want, then, then
He won't love you.
And it was real. I wasn't. I really thought.
They're all safe, aren't they? The children, the grandchildren. Everyone's safe?
Well, it's time. Thank you.
Did you see?
And yet I could.
Just
Just stop the bombardment. That's all I'm asking. I'll do anything you want, just, just stop.
Please.
Now I can't, I can't pretend to understand, not for a second, but I want you to know I'm innocent in all this. He made me John Smith. It's not like I had any control over it.
I don't care about this Doctor and your family. I just want you to go. So I've made my choice. You can have him. Just take it, please! Take him away.
Where's it gone?
Oh, I think the explanation might be you've been fooled by a simple olfactory misdirection. Little bit like ventriloquism of the nose. It's an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy. But it has got to be said, I don't like the looks of that hydroconometer. It seems to be indicating you've got energy feedback all the way through the retrostabilisers feeding back into the primary heat converters. Oh. Because if there's one thing you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't have let me press all those buttons. But, in fairness, I will give you one word of advice. Run.
It's done.
He's in here somewhere.
Yes.
No.
Come with me.
Travel with me.
My companion.
No. We could start again. I'd like that. You and me. We could try, at least. Because everything that John Smith is and was, I'm capable of that, too.
Please come with me.
Why not?
But he's here, inside, if you look in my eyes.
Right then. Molto bene.
Time we moved on.
Time we moved on.
Oh yeah, of course you would. Yeah.
Oh, no, no.
Fine.
There we are, yes. And I never said. Thanks for looking after me.
Tim Timothy Timber.
Tim, I'd be honoured if you'd take this.
No, it's just a watch now. But keep it with you, for good luck.
You'll like this bit.
In June 1914, an Archduke of Austria was shot by a Serbian, and this then led, through nations having treaties with nations, like a line of dominoes falling, to some boys from England walking together in France on a terrible day.

Chameleon circuit.
Look, whenever you see me in this part of the Tardis, pacing up and down like this, be a good chap and don't interrupt me, will you, unless it's terribly urgent. It's not terribly urgent, is it?
Good, so now you'll know in fact there's no need for you to come barging in here at all, but if it is terribly urgent you can always ring the Cloister Bell.
Yes.
Well, it's a sort of communications device reserved for wild catastrophes and sudden calls to man the battle stations.
No, no, no, nothing along those lines. I sometimes think I should be running a tighter ship.
Yes. The second law of thermodynamics is taking its toll on the old thing. Entropy increases.
Yes, daily. The more you put things together, the more they keep falling apart, and that's the essence of the second law of thermodynamics and I never heard a truer word spoken. Come on. Come on.
Have you seen the state of the time column recently? Wheezing like a grampus.
Gallifrey? Oh yes, yes. Are you really set on going to Gallifrey?
Oh.
That's one of the questions I was just pondering. There's bound to be an awful lot of fuss about Romana. Why she stayed in E-space, official investigations, that sort of thing.
What? She has broken the cardinal rule of Gallifrey. She has become involved, and in a pretty permanent sort of way. I think that you and I should let a few oceans flow under a few bridges before we head back home.
Yes. Let me put another question to you. I have a place in mind that's on the way, well, more or less, give or take a parsec or two. It's my home from home. It's called Earth.
That's the chap.
Britain is. That's the one place where we can find these blue boxes.
Yes, but they're not. No spacious accommodation, no viewer screens. They don't even time travel. Just elementary Earth communications devices, and more or less obsolete by the time we'll be arriving there. There's some in the North that are still in use.
But not a police box.
Yes. What the mathematical model of a Tardis exterior is based upon.
Because I want to measure it.
Block transfer computation.
I'm not surprised. Logopolis is a quiet little planet.
No, that's the other place. We go to Logopolis afterwards.
No, no, no. It's all to do with the chameleon circuit problem. We measure the police box on Earth, then we take the measurements afterwards to Logopolis. Come on, I'll show you.
The Cloister Bell.
Yes.
Well, nothing, when it's not ringing.
Apparently not.
Yes, or else our old friend entropy's nibbling away at the system circuitry. Let's take a look.
Well, it's only the exterior of a Tardis that exists as a real space-time event.
Precisely. That's very good.
Ah, well, that's a sore point. According to the handbook, yeah, because the outer plasmic shell of a Tardis is driven by the chameleon circuit, or so the theory runs. In practice I always meant to ask Romana to help me fix it one day.
Ah. I suppose we're going to miss Romana.
Yes. Still, the future lies this way.
Exactly.
In a totter's yard. Anyway, it was ages ago. It doesn't matter. She was in on Gallifrey for repair when I borrowed her.
Well, on a sort of finders-keepers basis, yes. I should have waited till they'd done the chameleon conversion, but there were other pressing reasons at the time. Anything happening up there?
Good. Ah.
Well, it's an early version. The instructions have to be punched in by machine code.
Boring? In theory we should be able to do things like this.
There. You have a door there.
Well, we've got to be able to get in and out.
That's how the Master hid from us on Traken. Anyway, if this worked, I'd just have to punch a few buttons like this, and we'd be a pyramid.
Yes. I'm not sure we should be distinctive.
Yes. But since we left Traken, and then the Cloister Bell.
Mmm.
Yes. Ah, Earth. Nearly there.
We've missed.
At least, I suppose it's a miss, but I thought just for once we'd materialise on the right coordinates.
Two point six metres off target. What a landing.
That's what I just said. What a landing. No, no, no, no. Don't open the door.
There's no need to draw attention to ourselves. There's a simpler way, if I can just organise it. The Tardis and I are getting rather better at these short hops.
I hope not. That could produce some unpleasant dimensional anomalies. No, it's just an ordinary police box, around which we've materialised with considerable finesse, I hope you've noticed.
No, no, no, leave it alone.
It's a communications device. Adric, take down these dimensions. I've been meaning to do this for centuries.
Three point six seven metres normal to the back surface.
It has to be measured in every dimension.
In every dimension. I need every detail. The Logopolitans convert that into a precise mathematical model.
Well, to overlay it on the Tardis.
Well, it's a way of modelling space-time events through pure calculation.
No, transcendentally. It's quite hard to explain in a word.
Yes. I meant to do it all of course when they first offered to do the chameleon conversion for me. It's highly specialised. But they say it'll work. Leg up.
Because the actual working-out's incredibly tedious. Lots of fiddly computations. Much better to leave it to the Logopolitans. They do it standing on their heads.
Standing on their heads is an expression.
As a matter of fact, they don't use computers, they use word of mouth.
No.
Mutter. Intone.
Yes.
I've wondered that myself. I never quite had the nerve to ask them.
Another instrumentation failure.
No.
Definitely a gravity bubble. Pretty local too, by the look of it.
Well, we'd better not dematerialise till I've investigated. I have a feeling I'm overlooking the obvious again. Back in two shakes.
What are you doing, Adric?
What?
I'm afraid you're right. No! You'd better leave this to me.
Get back to the Tardis.
A Tardis, perhaps.
Yes, down to the last detail. No, wait, wait.
This could be terribly dangerous. You'd better stay with me.
It's too early to tell.
There are other things that can cause this sort of dimensional anomaly. See if you can do that again.
I hope not, because if it is, we'll never get out of it.
Here, you do it.
We can't go back now.
We must be getting near to the nucleus of the bubble.
Another Tardis.
Yes. Someone's been here before us. Stay here, Adric.
Ah, good morning.
Which vehicle?
No.
It isn't easy to explain.
So he did escape from Traken.
But he's still about, somewhere.
Yes. The Master.
Now just a minute, officer. You don't realise what's going on here.
Me lucky? You don't think that I? You do think.
Well, I do have opinions. This is the calling card of the most evil genius in the universe and I have to tell you gentlemen, I've got to get after him. Now, if you'll just help me to create a diversion, hmm?
I'd love to.
Would you mind awfully if I stopped to telephone my solicitor?
It seems we're going to be awfully busy at this station of yours. I mean, isn't that a telephone box?
But that would do fine, don't you agree?
Er, no.
It could be anywhere in the Tardis.
Absolutely.
A choice of emergencies. We'd better dematerialise first.
The Tardis is very sluggish. We may not have any choice at all.
It's dragging us back. We'll have to find some more power from somewhere.
Well, shut the door, then. There must be some way of simplifying this. Architectural configuration, that's the one.
Interior allocation of space. Adric, I'm going to jettison Romana's room.
This is life. Nothing's sure.
Look, do you want a quick decision or a debate?
You see? There's no need to shout.
Yes.
Somehow I rather doubt that. Come on, Adric.
Why don't you answer it? Go on. Go on.
Yes, so now we know.
The message was very faint. It was from Traken.
Nyssa's all right.
Vanished. The Master must have had a second Tardis hidden away somewhere.
To renew himself. He was very near the end of his twelfth regeneration.
Yes.
Well, not just a Time Lord by himself, but with some of the powers of the Keepership still lingering. Huh, and I was so sure. I was so sure. He must have known I was going to fix the chameleon circuit.
Well, he's a Time Lord! In many ways, we have the same mind.
No, how can we with the Master in the Tardis? They're a retiring people. They like a quiet life. There's no telling what a creature like that would do on Logopolis.
And there's no saying what that might do to the Tardis systems. Can you swim?
Good. Materialise the Tardis underwater and open the door.
That's the River Thames. We'll put down there.
Yes. Adric, shut down everything. Fold back the Omega configuration.
Good. Exponential cross-field?
Good. Pathways to conditional states seven to seventeen?
Excellent. Main and auxiliary drive?
Good. Now, we're partially materialised, so there'll be a slight jolt. Are you ready?
What? Well, I'd feel more confident if you just said yes.
Good. Here we go, then.
A gentle splash-down.
We must have touched bottom.
Yes. Good thing the water was there to break our fall.
Careful, now. The water pressure could send us both flying. Ready?
Now!
That's odd. There's no pressure on those doors at all.
Ah. I thought there's be a perfectly simple explanation.
Nearly, but not quite right. There's something not quite right about all of this.
Nothing like this has ever happened before. I've got to get to the bottom of this. You stay here.
Door.
Set.
Logopolis.
I've just dipped into the future. We must be prepared for the worst.
Hmm? How do you deduce that?
Never guess. Unless you have to. There's enough uncertainty in the universe as it is.
In the ordinary way, yes. This is something far too serious.
A chain of circumstances that fragments the law that holds the universe together.
Yes. That aerial's a recent addition.
You are.
You and I have to part company.
Adric, don't argue.
Who is she? Where did she come from? What are we going to do with her?
Your aunt? Woman in the white hat, red sports car?
Well, a little of her. That settles it. She's got to come with us.
Well, it's very nice of you to put it like that, Monitor.
Shush. We're all very honoured to be here.
Logopolis.
Yes. The antenna's new, Monitor.
If your computations can help solve a problem in my Tardis, I'd be eternally grateful, Monitor.
Yes, all noted down. Monitor, I don't wish to press you but my problem is now extremely urgent.
Yes, yes.
But all this is new, Monitor, and vaguely familiar.
That's right.
Yes, historically the Logopolitans do everything
The numbers. He's recreating the Tardis.
Thank you, Monitor. I'm certainly looking forward to having a properly functioning Tardis.
Oh, indeed, Monitor, indeed.
Do you really feel up to an explanation?
Well. Adric, you explain.
Splendid, Monitor. I've really been looking forward to this. Of course! The Pharos Project! But this is a near replica of the Pharos computer room.
What?
What, you can model the Pharos Project mathematically?
Well, then, you can model any space-time event in the universe.
Yes. Yes.
A famous Earth project to transmit signals to remote planets.
Ah.
Monitor, I must ask you a very special favour.
Adric and the girl. Would you look after them for me?
No. What lies ahead is for me, not for them. I hate farewells.
Must dematerialise. Dematerialise. Nothing working. Nothing.
They've arrested the dimension spiral. Things are looking up.
An error in the dimension subroutine. Somewhere here. I will not be beaten. I simply will not be beaten. But I could certainly do with a little more help from outside.
The cheeseboard is the world, and the pieces the phenomena of the universe, as my old friend Huxley used to say. Cheese board? Chess board. And the opponent makes no allowances for mistakes nor makes the smallest concession to ignorance.
I'm an ignorant old Doctor, and I've made a mistake. There's only one direction help can come from now. I'll just have to sit here and wait.
Ah yes! Something along those lines.
Monitor?
I can't thank you enough.
You too, Tegan. You too. Where are the others?
What? They should know better than that. There've been enough unnecessary deaths as it is.
And the murder of innocent Earth people.
Yes.
Yes. I'm so sorry, Tegan. I'm so sorry.
The Master's already at work on Logopolis. I'm going to stop him if it's the last thing I do.
Adric, Nyssa. Come on.
I don't want you two chasing after the Master independently. You, Adric, should know how dangerous he is.
Yes.
Yes.
Indeed I did, and I am prepared for the worst.
Because he's here.
There's much more to this block transfer computation than we thought.
Yes. Yes, but why? Why build a replica of the Pharos Project? Central Register.
Quite.
And I was vain enough to think it was me he was after. Logopolis is his target.
That's not your father. Tremas is dead, murdered by him, the Master.
This is not conquest, it's devastation.
Which is killing the Logopolitans and turning them to dust.
Yes!
You're interfering with the law of cause and effect.
Don't you understand? Logopolis is crucial to the whole of creation. This could mean the end of the universe.
Then come into the streets and see what's happening.
The numbers were supporting the whole system.
The entropy you released is eroding your systems, too.
Don't.
Passed the point?
We passed through one of your voids, Monitor.
Not quite.
We must pool our resources.
I can't choose the company I keep!
In the circumstances, yes.
If we don't cooperate, there'll be no question of Gallifrey.
Please. Shush. As Time Lords, you and I have special responsibilities.
I've never chosen my own company. Nyssa, it was you who contacted me and begged me to help you find your father. Tegan, it's your own curiosity that got you into this. And Adric, a stowaway.
Did I say there was no one in it?
I don't want any further argument. One, two, three of you into the Tardis, quickly. Go on.
It's impossible. My friend in there will look after you. I'm collaborating with the Master. Now go on. Battle stations.
One last hope.
Monitor? He's gone.
The Monitor wouldn't abandon us.
Yes, maybe. It was the last addition to Logopolis. It might be the last one to survive. We need his knowledge. Come on.
The rot is spilling outwards into the universe from this point after eons of constraint. Come on. Let's collect the Monitor and get out.
There's no other way.
Yes, aren't I.
Monitor?
Monitor, the stability of
What, do you mean the advanced research project?
Monitor, were you on the right track? You must tell us about the project in every detail.
Yes.
Tegan, I told you to get out of here.
As safe as houses, eh?
No, no, no, no, listen. Reconfigure the two Tardises into time cone inverters? It would work. What a brilliant mind.
The Monitor's programme. You can help me.
Yes. I want this in pieces.
As I thought.
Bubble memory.
Yes. You realise what this means?
Bubble memory is non-volatile. Remove the power and the bit patterns are still retained in tiny magnetic domains in these chips. The research team's final project is still here.
I've an idea where we could find one. On Earth.
Yes. The Master's Tardis. Come on.
One good lift deserves another, don't you think?
Earth, please.
Yes. I envy you your Tardis, Master.
Shush.
No!
I'm so sorry. I thought you meant to shoot him.
Yes.
Ahem. Good morning. Good evening.
He's unconscious.
Oh, I don't know. It's a sort of vague faith in the nature of things, I suppose.
Yes, well, it's the age-old battle, isn't it? Entropy versus structure. Still, while there's life there's six of one and half a dozen of the other.
Yes, but very comforting when worn next to the skin.
Any good?
Of course. The programme's not being fed into the core.
We start again.
It's running.
Well, we'll just have to wait until the data reaches the CVE.
Yes.
I suggest we use your Tardis.
We've still got to get across to the antenna control room.
Good.
Three C four six one.
You overlooked the light speed overdrive.
Thank you.
What?
What? And powered up, I see.
The data's reached the CVE. It's stabilising.
You did most of this.
You're quite right. One mistake now could ruin everything.
What do you mean?
You're mad!
Blackmail.
You're utterly mad.
Only while that cable holds.
It's the end. But the moment has been prepared for.

Leave her alone.
I have one thing to say to you. You know what it is.
I told you. I have one thing to say.
I just need you to listen.
Then stop.
It's only you.
When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do was fuse the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can only travel between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis landed, Which is right here, right now.
But you're changing history. Not just Earth, the entire universe.
But even then, why come all this way just to destroy?
As if I would ask her to kill.
Use the countdown.
I've had a whole year to tune myself into the psychic network and integrate with its matrices.
The one thing you can't do. Stop them thinking.
Tell me the human race is degenerate now, when they can do this.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
And you know what happens now.
You wouldn't listen.
Because you know what I'm going to say.
I forgive you.
Captain, the paradox machine!
No!
We've got control of the Valiant. You can't launch.
Weapon after weapon after weapon. All you do is talk and talk and talk. But over all these years and all these disasters, I've always had the greatest secret of them all. I know you. Explode those ships, you kill yourself. That's the one thing you can never do. Give that to me.
Everyone get down! Time is reversing!
The paradox is broken. We've reverted back, one year and one day. Two minutes past eight in the morning.
Just after the President was killed, but just before the spheres arrived. Everything back to normal. Planet Earth restored. None of it happened. The rockets, the terror. It never was.
Trapped at the end of the universe.
We're at the eye of the storm. The only ones who'll ever know. Oh, hello. You must be Mister Jones. We haven't actually met.
No, that's not the solution.
Francine, you're better than him.
You're my responsibility from now on. The only Time Lord left in existence.
No. The only safe place for him is the Tardis.
Mmm. If that's what I have to do. It's time to change. Maybe I've been wandering for too long. Now I've got someone to care for.
There you go. I've got you. I've got you.
I didn't see her.
You're not dying. Don't be stupid. It's only a bullet. Just regenerate.
One little bullet. Come on.
Regenerate. Just regenerate. Please. Please! Just regenerate. Come on.
You've got to. Come on. It can't end like this. You and me, all the things we've done. Axons. Remember the Axons? And the Daleks. We're the only two left. There's no one else. Regenerate!
No!
Good.
I really don't mind, though. Come with me.
Defending the Earth. Can't argue with that.
I can't have you walking around with a time travelling teleport. You could go anywhere, twice. The second time to apologise.
Nothing I can do. You're an impossible thing, Jack.
I really don't know.
No.
No. Definitely not. No. No.
Right then, off we go. The open road. There is a burst of starfire right now over the coast of Meta Sigmafolio. Oh, the sky is like oil on water. Fancy a look? Or back in time. We could, I don't know, Charles the Second? Henry the Eighth. I know. What about Agatha Christie? I'd love to meet Agatha Christie. I bet she's brilliant. Okay.
Yeah.
Of course not. Thank you. Martha Jones, you saved the world.
Always. Yeah.
Is this going anywhere?
Got it.
What. What?
What?

Daleks. I sometimes think those mutated misfits will terrorise the universe for the rest of time.
Yes, obsessed and depressed.
Well, we were together a long time.
Kamelion!
No, no, no. No, we need to stop the spasming. Go and programme an alpha rhythm on the computer. It should calm him.
It's all right, Kamelion. Help's on its way.
Contact who? What's happening?
The spasming's stopped and he's fully conscious. I just wish I
What have you done?
And why have you reset the coordinates?
Someone has.
Kamelion denies hearing any transmission. Did you get a precise fix on the signal?
Oh. Well, if it transmits again we'll get a fix on it with this.
A kouros, late Classical period. It's really rather fine. I'd hazard a guess by a pupil of Praxiteles.
Hmm. It's a pity about the erosion, but the overall effect is not unattractive, like the marine Venus on Rhodes. Has this just been brought up from the seabed?
Indeed. But more of a mixed bag than you realise.
Er, nothing.
Goodbye.
Without a doubt. We'll need two readings to pinpoint the spot exactly.
Yes, hurry. I don't know how long there'll be before the next emission.
The point of emission moved. It's odd. It's very odd indeed. You're soaking wet.
A data core. Where did you find this?
Hmm. Must be what was sending the signal. Now, with a little help from the Tardis computer, we may find out exactly why Kamelion set the coordinates to come here.
Another moment and we'll know where the cylinder came from.
Well, that shouldn't have happened. Ow!
Did you do that?
The Tardis has dematerialised.
How did you get in here?
Peri?
What girl?
Er, I'm not sure yet, but I promise I'll get you back to Earth just as soon as I can.
Bleak, isn't it.
Snap.
Oh, is that what it's called.
Very old. By the look of it, deserted.
We should get back to the Professor and the girl.
Peri.
There's no one alive on this planet.
Let's get a move on. The Tardis computer may be confident the volcano isn't about to blow, but instinct tells me otherwise.
Why have you never mentioned your home planet before?
Are you in trouble?
Instinct. And the fact I've never seen you so nervous before.
Here and there.
I'm afraid not.
Please forgive my friend. He seems to have made a mistake. I would like to know more about Logar.
Look, I know it isn't polite for a stranger to take over a party, but you really must get away from here. The volcano isn't stable.
Oh, far from it. The tunnel we've just come along is a vent for the volcano.
It's the same route the molten lava will take to burn you alive. I have a ship. I can get you away from here. Think about it.
Is this from Trion?
Yes. Your Trion settlers must have tapped the volcanic gas. It's a very complex control mechanism. A seismic energy converter for powering a city.
In principle, yes.
Not from here, you won't.
Good.
Possibly.
How do you do.
Not a very hospitable planet at the moment.
Er, yes. Well, what Amyand said is right. What you call the spirit of the mountain is fire itself, and that fire will pour down onto your settlement destroying everything in its path.
I can't save your planet, but I can get you away from here.
Whoever your benefactor, they provided you with a transceiver unit, even if somewhat incomplete.
Er, it's a way of communicating with other people. Possibly a more effective way of getting you settled on another planet. The Trions must have a form of colony or something, eh, Turlough? If you could get a message to the Trion, they could send a rescue ship.
What are you talking about?
Turlough?
Ow! We need more power.
Good, good, I need to speak to him. We've a full-scale exodus to organise.
Look, be a good fellow. We're trying to help. The volcano could erupt at any moment.
There is no Outsider.
Oh, no.
The man's an imposter.
No!
I don't know where the girl is. I don't have the comparator!
No!
You must believe me!
Stop this!
Oh, don't you know? Allow me to introduce Malkon, Chosen One of the Sarns. You see? He's no Outsider. He doesn't recognise your Chosen One, and he doesn't understand the laws of the settlement.
He's not dead, but let them think he is.
Life must be very complicated for you at the moment. Not only are you a phony Outsider, you're not even the real Master. You're just a machine. Oh, no, no, don't turn away. You will accept my will. I am the Doctor and you are Kamelion.
You are no more than the sum of your parts, a mass of printed circuits.
You see? He likes to kill. He turned on your Chosen One. Next time it'll be you, Chief Elder.
Oh, you'll have a sign, all right. If I can break the energy link with the Master, this so-called will be nothing but a heap of spare parts. You're on your own, Kamelion. Your power is weakening, turning to silver. A silver puppet jumping on a string. String cut!
Psychomorphic fringing. Nothing supernatural about that, it's an intermediate stage between anthropoid and robotic identity.
I must concentrate.
Obey me. The Doctor. The Doctor.
Mustn't resist. Any distraction will allow the Master to break through. That's right, Kamelion. Servile. Slave! Bond broken.
The cave. Somehow it's screening the thought control.
Peri, get back.
Interesting. I knew something other than rock must be screening me from Kamelion's mind.
What kept you?
One of the Elders.
What good would that do? We must get after Peri.
Come on.
How do you know Malkon is your brother?
How does that make him your brother?
He's in severe shock. There may be some damage to his nervous system. Keep him warm. Make him as comfortable as you can. Why fuel the cave with volcanic gas?
With all due respect to your fellow Sarns, I think the people who built this had a more useful purpose than burnt offerings to Logar. Come on.
To find the Master and his Tardis. Do you know this ruin he spoke of?
Don't you want to stay with Malkon?
Does everyone from Trion have this mark?
Something must have happened to the Master for him to be using Kamelion.
His present body must be good for a few years yet. There has to be another reason.
No. No, no, that's the Master's Tardis.
I can stop the Master by materialising around his Tardis.
We're stuck. The temporal stabiliser's been removed. Another old trick of the Master's.
Hmm? Er, I don't know yet. Someone's been interfering with the Tardis navigational system. Kamelion. It's been remote-paralleled with the Master's Tardis. So that's how he followed us to Sarn.
Hmm? Oh, it's perfectly simple. If this machine were working properly, we'd follow the Master's Tardis.
Indeed. Although the effort would hardly be worthwhile. He's still on Sarn.
There's something the Master needs on Sarn. If we could find it, we'd find him. I think Turlough will need some help.
A sign from Logar. What does he look like, this fire lord?
How about that?
Welcome, gentlemen.
Do any of you recognise this?
Hmm. Must be some sort of control centre inside the volcano. Timanov, have you actually ever seen Logar?
Where?
I wonder if that's what the Master wants. To be born again.
Now, isn't that interesting? According to this, the Master and Peri are inside the volcano.
The seismic scanner. Something's happening inside the volcano.
Shall we gaze upon it too?
I don't think so. That isn't an eruption.
I wonder if Logar will help a sick Time Lord. Perhaps the Master needs the blue flame more than the people of Sarn.
No, no, no, the Hall of Fire. I want to analyse the deposit on the walls. Unless, of course, you can tell me what it is?
The control centre's been maintained. Just what sort of interest have your people got in the stability of an abandoned planet?
When we arrived, you expected to find Trions here. Why?
If this is an abandoned planet, what was your father doing here? All right. But if you're holding back anything that will aid the Master, our friendship is at an end. Is that understood?
Hmm. Trace elements of numismaton gas. Very useful for an injured Time Lord who can't regenerate. Now, why would he want the gas in such quantities?
Even if I were in a better humour, that wouldn't be funny.
No.
Thanks to the Master, he's far better off here. I must get back to the bunker and organise the gas flow.
There's healing power in one of the volcanic gases. Could be why the Trions constructed the Hall of Fire, some sort of curative centre. I must release the gas flow. Strictly for medicinal purposes, of course. There we are.
Why not, if it saves Malkon's life? Bring him to the Hall of Fire, quickly.
Excellent.
There's still a residue of hot gas still to burn off.
Where did you get this?
More gifts from Logar?
Pure numismaton gas. It's quite safe.
Look.
Logar had very little to do with it.
You were shot, but you should be all right now.
Amyand, I'll need your help as a guide. We must get to the seismic control centre.
Turlough, when I've got the Tardis working, we'll materialise here and take the Sarns on board.
Why?
Couldn't do better.
Just a minute. You were concerned about the Custodians earlier.
You are in trouble.
Turlough, how did your family become criminals?
But how could they possibly know you've absconded?
I'll see you back at the Tardis.
This must have been a very fertile planet.
Oh, don't be too hard on them. It's their technology that's maintained the stability of the planet.
They did their best. The silver things that were seen on the mountain, they were Trion volcanologists attempting to control the eruptions.
Well, that's at an end. The old order's gone forever. There'll be no more Outsiders, no more Chosen Ones.
With a leader like you, Amyand, your people will soon advance.
Get back!
All right, come on.
Quickly.
The seismic control centre. It's impressive. The question is, how effective. Keep an eye on him, would you?
Trying to slow down the eruption. The Master's interference has caused the seismic machinery to become unstable. If I can override the automatic controller, I can delay the worst of it.
I doubt it. The Master's already triggered a massive surge of numismaton gas in the planet's core. It that hits the surface it will disrupt the inhibition circuit altogether. There'll be devastation.
There we are. That should hold back the eruption for a while. Now for the Master.
Fair exchange is no robbery. The Master's temporal stabiliser.
Oh yes.
How does it feel to get a taste of your own medicine?
Albeit in somewhat reduced circumstances.
Ah, you're experimenting with the Tissue Compression Eliminator.
You made it too powerful for your own good.
And a very small Master. That's why you needed Kamelion, isn't it?
The scream in the Tardis. He even felt your pain.
No need to remind you what will happen if you use that thing in here.
He needs to move his Tardis into the circle of flame. When the next surge comes, he'll be surrounded by restorative gas. Amyand, I want you to go back to Turlough and give him this.
No, we're not. Amyand, your turn to play Logar.
I'm trying to raise some local radiation. If I can induce a sympathetic reaction in Kamelion's psychocircuits, he'll have the electronic equivalent of a heart attack.
You'll see. Now, when I give you the word, I want you to push this control here hard to its end stop, all right? Now, get down behind the desk.
He won't dare fire and risk hitting the control system.
I hope so. What I've prepared will only work at close range.
Just as you say.
(sotto) Keep down. (loud) Now!
I'm sorry too, Kamelion.
(to Peri) Get back.
I must try to control the surge of energy the Master's programmed, otherwise the planet could be destroyed before the Sarns can escape.
I don't know. I just hope Amyand get the stabiliser to Turlough in time.
He doesn't have to. It's still linked with the Master's. It should materialise in the same relationship as the ruin.
It's no good to us. The Tardis is the only way out of here. Hurry up, Turlough.
Well done, Turlough. Quickly, into the Tardis.
Er, yes, of course. I'm all right.
I'm pleased for you.
I shall miss you.
Better to go back while you're a bit of a hero, eh?
Well, I should get you home.
Oh, yes. Your friends will be worried.
And you want to travel with me.
Actually, it was a question.
Three months, you say?
All right. Why not.
Welcome aboard, Peri.

I don't believe it. Marvellous. After all this time.
Well, don't you see, Jamie? It's the Himalayas. And I do believe we're in exactly the right. Now, wait a minute.
Shush. Shush.
Shush, Jamie, shush. Yes, of course it's the Earth. Yes, yes, I think I'm right. Yes.
Yes, that's it! I knew it, I knew it. It's incredible. Right. Oh no. No, not India. This is Tibet. That's where we are, Tibet. Now, there's no time to be lost. Come along, Jamie, we must find the ghanta.
The ghanta, the ghanta. I put it here somewhere. Come along, Jamie, help me.
I told you it's. Good Lord, I haven't seen that for years.
No, no, no, no. It's a. Well, whatever it is, it's nice to see it again.
Thank you. Come along, Victoria.
No, Jamie.
Yes, I was afraid of that.
Come along, help me find the ghanta.
Ghanta!
Oh, what is it? You don't know? Oh, it's a bell.
Yes, it's a Tibetan bell, actually. A holy relic. This one is quite small. It has a dragon on it. As a matter of fact, it has rather an interesting history. It was. Oh. Ah ha, yes, I'll have that.
Yes, it's just the thing for this climate. Now, you might as well find yourselves something while you're about it. How do I look?
Yes, I thought I might. I think I'll go and have a scout around. Now, you two find the bell. It's very important.
Because down there it's going to guarantee us the welcome of a lifetime.
Yes. Ah, yes.
Oh, splendid, splendid.
Yes. No. One thing at a time, Victoria. We must find this ghanta.
Hmm? Ah. Hmm.
Detsen, yes, that's the name of the monastery, but I'm afraid you're not going. Well, not yet a while anyway.
No, I think it'd be better if I went alone.
Oh, good heavens, no. No, there's nothing for you to worry about. Now, you stay here with Jamie, inside, and I'll be as quick as I can.
Oh. I nearly forgot it.
Anybody here?
Hello there?
Hello? Where is everybody?
Oh, there you are. I thought, I thought for one moment.
I've come to
Oh, that. Oh.
Me? I haven't attacked anyone. I found the haversack on the mountain.
I also found a dead man.
But you can't possibly
But this is ridiculous. Why don't you listen to me? Where are you taking me?
The welcome of a life time?
I didn't think there would be.
Track you down? I don't even know who you are.
Paper men? I wish I know what you are talking about?
Twenty years.
Finding them? Finding what?
What are?.
But it could have been the Yeti that attacked you.
But
Why me? Why say I did it?
That is ridiculous.
Whoever killed your friend had enormous strength.
Well, could I have done it? Well, could I?
Travers. Travers, come back!
DOCTOR plays 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' on his recorder. Thomni enters.)
Ah, and about time too. Come to release me, have you?
Oh. Oh, well, first things first. What's your name?
Oh, I see, Thomni. After we've had a little chat.
No, no. Just wait. No one seems to want to listen to me and everyone is jumping to the wrong conclusions. Now, you seem to be a reasonable sort of chap. What's going on here?
Until I turned up. I see. Every time I visit Detsen the monastery seems to be in some sort of trouble or another.
That attack in 1630, what was the outcome?
Yes, a little.
Oh, dear. Never mind, I'm sure it'll turn up again.
This chap Travers. This chap Travers, what of him?
Ah yes, he may be angry, but he's not the Abbot, is he?
No. I don't think you'll find the Abbot will be angry when he sees what I've bought with me.
I want you to help me to get this to the Abbot.
Abbot. The straw.
Travers, don't you think this has gone far enough?
What do you hope to gain?
Time?
You can't possibly leave
Men of peace?
Look, nobody is going to rescue me, least of all an abominable snowman. And hasn't it occurred to you, that innocent or guilty, whatever's been killing your monks might very well kill me.
Oh no.
Jamie! Victoria! Keep back!
Keep back! They'll kill you!
Keep away! Get away!
I told you to keep away. He's lead you into a trap.
Of course.
You'd already accused me of murder. You were hardly in the right frame of mind to listen to my story of how I came by the bell, now where you? Oh please.
This wasn't the welcome I expected, you know. As for you, Travers.
You say you found this in the cave?
I've no idea. Now, this creature, what was it like?
It does sound like your abominable snowman, Travers.
No, I always thought so.
What made this? I wonder what it's for. Oh well.
I'd like to see one of these creatures.
Including creatures that don't seem to be flesh and blood.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Do you really think they'll attack?
Yes, but if they do, do you think you could capture one? I would like to examine one.
Thank you, Jamie.
Oh. Victoria?
Victoria, I think this is one of those instances where discretion is the better part of valour. Jamie has an idea. Come along.
Come along.
I can assure you I am not.
You were right about one thing, Victoria. This creature certainly doesn't seem to be flesh and blood.
It's not your abominable snowman either, Travers. Look.
It's metal.
No, I don't think so. It's more like a robot.
Now, why has it stopped? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
No, but there has been.
Jamie, when you captured this creature, you must have dislodged it's control unit.
Precisely.
To have a look outside the gates. I want that unit. Come on, Jamie.
But why not?
Well if you don't trust us at least send Thomni, or one of your other warriors.
If you want us to help you.
Oh, dear. A very obstinate man.
Oh I wouldn't say that, Jamie. He's just doing his duty as he sees it.
Oh, thank you, Thomni.
What is it?
Yes?
Yes, but I've thought of that. But the thing was as light as a feather. There couldn't have been anything inside it. Unless. Where is it?
I remember. I put it down somewhere.
The Buddha. I put it down by the Buddha. Oh now, please, Thomni. Please.
But I swear I put it down here by the Buddha.
Oh dear.
No, tact, Jamie. I'll handle this. Hello, guard. good evening. I wonder if you can help us. I left a silver sphere by the Buddha there.
Travers? Are you sure he didn't pick it up?
Gone?
But that's impossible.
Yes, but why?
I wonder. Are you sure he didn't take the sphere with him?
Right, Jamie.
Yes, yes. Travers. I can't believe he has anything to do with these robots.
Khrisong. Khrisong, I must speak with you.
Have you given Travers permission to leave the monastery?
Well, he's gone.
The guard at the gate said you'd given him permission.
It's about time you let me help you.
Oh well, what's done is done. Ah, Jamie.
I see. Khrisong, you must see that it is vital that I examine one of these control units. Now, the one that Jamie bought down from the mountains has disappeared. Someone is trying to stop us learning the truth.
Hasn't he found it yet?
Khrisong! Behind you. Yeti.
Don't be a fool.
Come on, Jamie. Quick, get him inside. They came to get their ball back.
They didn't come to fight. They came for the sphere.
Pretty sure. They didn't want me to examine it.
That sphere is like a brain. They had to get it back.
I'd still like to know what happened to that one.
This sound that you heard.
Yes, it could be. Anyway, its a help.
Well, with the right sort of equipment, these signals can be tracked.
Yes, Jamie.
We've got to back to the Tardis.
Yes. But it's outside there on the mountain.
Come on. Let's get me coat.
They're not moving.
Perhaps they're switched off? I wonder.
Yes, perhaps you're right. Come on.
Oh? Oh, I'm just taking a breather, that's all.
No, no, nothing.
Listen.
Yes, that's what's worrying me. It's too quiet. We've not seen a sign of the Yeti since we left those three back there.
I don't like it. There's something happening on this mountain. I can feel it.
I thought we'd been too lucky.
I don't know. We've got to get to the Tardis somehow.
No.
Hmm?
It's a robot, Jamie. It merely follows instructions.
That we shall have to find out, won't we?
Yes.
Yes, Jamie, I believe I have.
Bung a rock at it.
Jamie, I am.
There you are, you see? Just as I thought. It can't see and it can't feel. Come on.
Well. it's quite all right, Jamie. It's like those three back there. It's either switched off or not receiving. Come along.
Well, quite frankly, no, Jamie. But there's only one way of finding out.
No, I don't think so, Jamie. Yes, just as I thought. Now then.
Jamie, will you hold this flap open for me, please? Thank you.
Well, I'm glad that's over. Catch.
Yes.
You mean, why didn't they build in some sort of protective device?
Well, perhaps they didn't think it was necessary. I mean, look at him. Would you walk up to a creature like that with just a screwdriver in your hand?
No, there you are. I'm really rather pleased with myself.
Yes, Jamie. Sorry, I'm just coming.
Jamie?
Ah, splendid, splendid. It's sending out a signal. That's just what we wanted.
Oh, no, you mustn't do that. Jamie, no!
Whatever happens, you mustn't let go, Jamie.
No.
Jamie, get a rock.
A rock! Put it in the hole in its chest.
Yes, I'm all right. Just a bit puffed, that's all. Jamie, these things are programmed to return to their Yetis. That one that disappeared in the monastery. That wasn't taken.
What is it?
Oh no. No, that's another sort of signal.
Jamie, I've just picked up another signal.
Jamie, you don't seem to understand.
What a perfect opportunity to trace the main transmitter.
Not much further.
Well, we were expecting it.
Jamie, give me the sphere. Give me the box.
Move forward very slowly. Jamie, when I say run, run. Run like the wind. Don't worry about me.
Now, Jamie, please. No heroics, Jamie.
Now Jamie. Run. Run! I know what I'm doing. I hope.
It worked.
Yes.
Travers!
Shh. Go on.
Where is Victoria?
What is this about Victoria? Where is she? Where are you taking us?
All right, Travers. You're quite safe.
Yes.
Just relax. You're safe, in the monastery.
What happened? Where did you go to?
You just rest.
What is it?
Yes?
You just rest. You'll feel better. Poor fellow, he's completely exhausted.
We'll just let him sleep.
Shush.
I see, Thomni. So here lies north.
What are those readings again, Jamie? Jamie, the readings?
The readings?
Yes, I know, but there's nothing we can do about her.
Two ninety seven. Now that will give us a bearing roughly there.
No. We want another bearing, say, from there. And where those two cross, that will be where the transmissions are coming from. But that won't tell us why.
Yes, what is the purpose behind all this. That's what we have to find out, ay Jamie?
Are you feeling better?
You had a spot of trouble on the mountain.
Yes, I'm sure it'll all come back to you in time.
Let me see.
Yes, Victoria.
Yes, yes of course.
How long has she been like this?
Yes, Victoria.
Still? What do you mean?
But that was three hundred years ago. It's the same man.
(sotto) Jamie, there is something I have to do.
It's my voice. She reacts to my voice.
Yes I can, but I need more information. Now, you wait here.
I'm going to see a very old friend.
Padmasambhava. So it's true.
Kept alive? I don't understand.
What? Try to tell me.
I see. You made mental contact with this intelligence?
But why?
Yes, of course I will help you. But first you must tell me things. Why are the monks being driven away? What is the purpose of these robots, the Yeti? Where is their control? Padmasambhava? Padmasambhava?
What on earth was that?
Not about Victoria, no. But I found some very interesting clues as to what's been happening.
Yes. Yes, you're quite right. Victoria must come first. Trouble is I really need more information. However, I'll just have to take a chance. It may just be simple post-hypnotic suggestion. On the other hand.
It may be something worse.
Well, let's just hope it isn't.
Victoria.
Yes, Victoria.
Listen to me. You've been taken away. You're no longer in the monastery. You're safe in the Tardis. Now do you understand? You're safe. In the Tardis. Yes. Well, look at me. Look at my eyes. You're feeling tired, very sleepy. Drift away. Let yourself drift away into sleep. Deeper. Deeper. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Oh, not you Jamie.
So far, so good.
No. Neither did the person who hypnotised Victoria.
Well, I'm tempted to ask her what happened, but I don't think I dare probe too deeply. The important thing is to get rid of this implanted fear. It's growing every minute.
Well, we shall just have to do as she asks and take her away. If we don't.
She'll go out of her mind.
Well, that's the object of the exercise. To get us away from the monastery. But I'm not beaten that easily.
I know what I'm doing, Jamie. Victoria? Now, Victoria, you can hear my voice, can't you?
Oh, good. Now I'm going to take you a little way back in the past, Victoria. You're in the cell with Thomni. Do you understand?
Good. Now you're going to forget everything after that. You went to sleep. Is that clear? Good. Jamie and I have come back to the monastery and you are in the meeting room with us. You're feeling happy, but a little tired. Do you understand?
Good. Now, when I count three, you're going to wake up. One, two, three.
Yes, I believe you did. I've got work to do.
Travers? Travers.
How are you feeling?
Yes. I think things are coming to a head.
Instructions. Travers, can you remember any more of what happened to you on the mountain?
Are you prepared to risk it again?
Yes, well, the monks are, but I want to get back up the mountain. One more bearing and I shall know where the control centre is.
Yes, if you will.
Oh, they're leaving with the monks, but I want to get out of here before anyone sees us. Will you help?
Oh, good.
What's the matter?
I want you to stay here and take some readings. Those Yeti are not transmitting. I'm going over there to stir things up a bit.
Oh no, it's far too dangerous. I can't ask you to take that sort of risk.
No, wait!
That's odd.
Yes.
Khrisong, I have found the control.
But you don't understand. It's here, in the monastery.
Are we? Are we all here?
It was Songsten who took this pyramid into the cave?
Songsten. He's the link I've been looking for.
Then he's in danger.
Jamie, grab hold of him. His hands.
Quick, get him out of here.
It's all right. Lie still. I'll get help.
I understand. Now just try and
He is quite right. He is quite right. You listen to him.
Yes, but by command, unknowingly. Thomni is right. Songsten is merely a puppet.
Now listen to me, all of you. Your Abbot is not responsible. But neither is Padmasambhava. He too is controlled. Now do as you'd planned. Leave the monastery. There is great evil here.
I will stay here, Thomni.
I have to. This things that's here, this evil, it will spread. It has to be stopped and I think I can do it. Thomni, will you help me? It will be dangerous.
Yes, I think I can. And if we succeed, the monks will be able to return.
Yes, Victoria. I think it best.
No, I didn't think you would.
No. Wait. There are things I have to find out and only Songsten can tell me.
Sit him down here, Jamie. Over there.
And the Yeti?
I see. Now, this Intelligence, it is confined to the cave?
No?
I see. Now, Songsten, I want you to help me.
Now these Yeti, they are controlled?
Yes, but the control units, they were made somehow, somewhere?
These small Yeti models. Their movements must be mirrored by the real robots?
But there must be a control. A machine that gives out the orders. Now, where is that control?
But I have seen the sanctum.
How do I get into it? Songsten, how do I get into it?
Take care of him, Sapan.
Now, as soon as the monks have left, we must get into that control room.
I'll deal with him. But remember, as soon as we're in the sanctum, whatever happens, Thomni and you must smash the controls.
Padmasambhava will use super-normal powers if necessary. For a start, he'll try to hypnotise you again.
Thomni, you'd better teach her the Jewel of the Lotus prayer. It'll give her something to concentrate on.
Jamie, where is Travers?
Well, he's not here.
No, I don't somehow think he's done that, but I'd like to know what he's up to.
Because they're needed to guard you and the lamas, Sapan.
Thank you. Don't worry, everything will be all right. When it's all over you can come back. I hope.
Now don't forget. I will go into the sanctum first and deal with Padmasambhava. And, as soon as it's safe, make for the curtain behind the throne. That's where the control room is.
I haven't the faintest idea.
Don't worry, Jamie. It's going to be all right.
Well nothing, I hope, but one of us just might need help. Are we ready? Come on.
Who are you?
Oh no, it isn't. I know Padmasambhava. He's my friend. Where have you come from? Why are you using his body in this fashion?
Too small?
Much power?
Just a simple levitation. A childish trick. Now stop playing games and open these doors. Or are you afraid to meet me face to face?
Now, anything can happen now. Just trust me, and above all, don't panic.
Now!
Quickly. Into the control room. Smash the controls.
Victoria, Victoria, I can't hold him. The models. Knock over the models! No, Victoria, don't let him. Jewel of the Lotus. Om mane padme hum. Om mane padme hum.
You've got to.
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Yeti's coming!
The cave. Jamie! There was a pyramid in the cave!
Destroy it!
Goodbye old friend.
Yes, Jamie. It worked. The Intelligence is destroyed.
Yes. Thomni, you can signal the monks they can return.
Oh no, no. He was just a tool in the hands of a monstrous brain. It wasn't his fault.
Ah no, Thomni, we're anxious to get back to the Tar.
We're anxious to get back.
Goodbye, Thomni.
Ah, they were clever machines. Almost a pity to have had them destroyed. Well, at least you'll have something to take home from your expedition, Mister Travers.
It can't be.
Well, that we shall never know, Jamie. What's the matter with you? Are you cold or something?
Yes, I suppose there is a little bit of a nip in the air.
What a horrible sight.
Jamie, you never know, do you?

There. Come one, Victoria, out you get.
The Tardis is perfectly capable of floating you know.
Oh England, undoubtedly.
And the white cliffs.
No, not usually, Jamie. (He scoops some up.) Hey Jamie, feel that.
Oh, I hardly think so, Jamie.
It's just what it says, Jamie. It's EuroSea Gas.
No, no, I shouldn't think so. I wonder what that is?
No, it won't touch it, I'm afraid, Jamie. Ah well, have to use this.
It's a sonic screwdriver. Never fails.
There we are. Neat isn't it? All done by sound waves. Now, what have we got here. Oh yes.
I don't know, Jamie.
Yes. It's probably only throbbing from a pump, you know.
All right, Victoria. Now then, Jamie.
Victoria? Jamie, you there?
Would someone kindly tell us where we are, please? Why don't you answer?
I think we've been tranquillised, Victoria.
Tranquillised.
You know, in this position it's just a little difficult to communicate.
Eh?
I think it's all right, I think it's the antidote.
Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, you know. Oh yes, thank you. Yes, that's better, thank you. Thank you very much. Yes.
I can assure you. I was only being curious.
You mean communications have broken down?
I told you I was merely being curious.
Oh dear.
It wasn't the valve I was interested in.
I heard a movement coming from inside the pipes.
Yes, movement. Don't ask me what it was.
But if the pressure is down in the pipes, perhaps that's the reason why? Perhaps marine life has got into the pipes.
Well, perhaps there's a fracture in the pipes. A break, and something's got in that way.
Mister Harris, I don't wish to appear interfering but don't you think it'd be a good idea to turn off the gas? At least until you've had a chance to check.
Why not?
He sounds a very silly man.
I've got it.
Can you see anyone?
Do you think you can make it?
No, he's not. Are you ready, Jamie?
Right.
Sorry about that, Jamie.
I think he's Dutch, Jamie, and I don't think he likes the English very much.
That's the noise I heard on the beach.
I don't know but we're going to find out. Come on, Jamie. Oh Victoria, no. Not you.
I think it'd be better if you stayed back in the bunk room. Please.
It's an impeller, Jamie. It pumps gas from the main pipe line out at sea. Come on.
Yes, yes, they all are. It's a continuation of the pipe we found on the beach.
Yes, It's transparent for checking condensation, and anything else that might get inside.
There it is again, Jamie. Can you hear it?
Your guess is as good as mine. There's something inside there.
Victoria! Come on!
Victoria, where are you?
Come on, Jamie.
I can smell gas!
Here you are.
Deep breaths. Take deep breaths.
Creature?
All right, Victoria.
Yes, it was locked.
Excuse me, may I say something? When I was in the pipe room a short while ago, I'm sure I heard a movement coming from inside the pipe.
Well, the same as I heard on the beach. A sort of thumping sound.
Then why did they hear it out at the rigs?
Oh, this wasn't a mechanical sound.
Turn off the gas flow. At least until you've had a chance to investigate.
And blow us with it.
Well, who knows.
Well, I'm not sure that I
I smell gas. There's gas in this house.
Jamie, the window, quickly!
Oh, no, no, no.
Well, she's in some sort of coma. Possibly because of this gas. It was toxic.
Well, this isn't natural gas. This is the gas we found when Victoria was locked in the Oxygen room.
I don't know. What was the matter with her before this happened?
Did you put it there?
There's no marks or abrasions.
Um.
What. Oh!
It's still wet.
No, don't touch it.
Well in the first place, you don't want to get stung like your wife, do you? And in the second place, whoever put it in your file meant you to touch it.
By the pipeline?
No, Jamie, don't touch it.
Yes, unless it really did move like Victoria said.
Everything in the sea is living, Jamie.
Yes, well, we're not taking any chances. Hold that for me, will you?
We're going to take a closer look at this weed. Now bring the bag down here. Right onto the floor. That's it. Now don't let it touch your fingers. Careful. Slowly does it. Mind your fingers. There.
We're going to see if an ordinary piece of seaweed really can move.
Oh, yes, I think so, yes. I don't think there's any panic, but I'd get her under medical supervision if I was you.
Yes, you do that.
Yes, so did I. We better make the most of it. We've got a lot of work to do back at the Tardis. She seems to be sleeping peacefully. Come on.
Well you see, Jamie, these two cylinders contain a small amount of natural gas. It should be quite interesting to see what sort of effect it has on the weed. How are you doing, Victoria?
Oh yes, well, that's got the natural iron content.
Oh yes, I'm not surprised. Is this hot?
You see this rusty stuff here.
Well, it means that the weed's giving out a gas. Probably toxic.
Now just a minute, Jamie. I'm looking at. Little wriggly things? Where?
Jamie, this is it! There's molecular movement! Come and see, Victoria. There. Why, that's amazing!
Yes. Yes, I was afraid it would be.
Well, I told you, Victoria, this is a book of legends and superstitions. This particular drawing was supplied by ancient mariners in the North Sea in the middle of the eighteenth century, Jamie.
Yes I think there's no doubt about it.
Well there's obviously some connection between the weed and the creatures themselves.
Gas!
Jamie! Jamie, help me get the lid on! Oh, no. Quickly!
I was right. The weed formations are feeding off the natural gas beneath the North Sea and giving off toxic gas. Come on. We must get back to Harrises' quarters. Come along. Just a minute. That weed went back in its tank very suddenly, didn't it? I wonder why? Never mind.
Well, thank you, Victoria. Yes, nobody here. It's better that way.
Gas!
Jamie, try the kitchen.
We've apparently frightened it away.
Mrs Harris. Ah. Oh yes, of course. Mister Harris had her taken over to the Medical centre. At least I hope he did.
That's Jamie!
The terrace!
Jamie! Victoria, come on, follow me.
Give me a hand!
Come on, out you come, Jamie.
Pass him down, Victoria.
Are you all right, Jamie?
Well, you just rest a while.
Well, Victoria, it's the spice of life, my dear.
Is something wrong?
Are you right, Jamie? Come on then.
That's where you're wrong, Mister Harris. We do know what they are. At least I think we do. Seaweed!
Yes. Not the sort that you'd normally find on the beach. This seaweed happens to be dangerously alive.
I think you better listen to me. I think you'd all better listen to me. Large formations of seaweed have been coming up on the beaches along this coast. Seaweed that shows clear indications of having life like human beings.
Yes, I think there's no doubt about it.
No, wait. The weed is capable of protecting itself. It gives off a toxic gas. It's also a parasite. It attaches itself to other living things.
I'm afraid I don't know.
Ah, yes, but she survived, didn't she? How is she?
Oh? Where?
Oh dear.
What?
Well, we've just come from your quarters. Your wife wasn't there!
Yes, yes, I'm afraid it is.
I don't know. I simply don't know.
Well, can't you send someone out to investigate?
We can do nothing.
Oh, I'm sorry, Victoria. Did I startle you?
Where's Jamie?
Oh good.
Well, I'm not sure, Victoria. I'm not sure. Looks so peaceful out there, doesn't it?
Yes.
Well, we have to wait.
Now, Victoria, it's not as bad as all that, you know.
Well, no, not exactly.
Yeti?
If you don't mind my saying so, Mister Van Lutyens, I think this is a very bad idea of yours. You don't know what you're up against.
I wish you wouldn't do this, Mister Van Lutyens.
Good luck.
Well, we don't know, Victoria.
What's happened? What did you see?
We can't just leave him down there.
We're going down there after him.
Jamie, you wouldn't let me go down there on my own, now would you?
Open the airlock.
Jamie, that hole goes straight down to the big gasometer down below.
Well, it must be.
Shine it down there, Jamie.
Give it to me.
No, it's too dark, Jamie. Not a sign of Van Lutyens.
Wait a minute.
Come on, Jamie. Let's get out of here. Press the lift button!
Take the lift up!
Give me your hand.
Yes, I think so.
It's the weed. It must fill the entire shaft. It was moving pretty quick, too.
I don't know.
No wonder they didn't see the lift shaft signal. There's no one here.
No. Not unless she'd been persuaded to. Jamie, I think we'd better go and look for her. Come on. You go that way. I'll go this way.
Oh, it's not that, I can assure you.
Well, I
I'm afraid not.
Yes. Jamie and I nearly joined him. The whole of the bottom of the impeller shaft is covered in weed and foam.
I'm afraid that Mister Robson is being controlled by some force that emanates from this weed.
Yes.
This is a struggle for power, Miss Jones. Matter over mind. I'm convinced all these people Mrs Harris, Chief Robson, Mister Van Lutyens, have all been overcome in this struggle and goodness knows how many more people.
From the human brain. It's parasitic.
I don't know, but they've certainly become part of the colony.
With the Control rig gone, we can draw only once conclusion. The weed is trying to take over all the rigs and form one vast colony.
The saturation of the British Islands and perhaps in time the entire planet.
Oh yes. Unless we can find the nerve centre and destroy it.
Yes, that is the difficulty.
What is it?
All right. What's happened?
The advance guard.
The first part of the invasion.
It's begun. The battle of the giants.
Your wasting your time, Miss Jones. By now all those rigs will have been taken over by the weed colony.
The worst, I'm afraid.
No, we daren't do that .
Well, that would spread this menace over a wide area and make it impossible to attack it.
No, what is the weed going to do?
Well, let's think. Now I imagine that in the first place the weed was drawn up by one of the drilling rigs.
Precisely. And the engineers who cleared it must have touched it, yes?
And since then, this attack, and it is an attack, has followed a set pattern.
Top priority people have been attacked first.
Yes, I'm very much afraid that is true.
Oh, and what's that?
Yes, that's something that's been puzzling me too. But she disturbed somebody who was interfering with the oxygen supplies.
Now supposing that person was under the control of the weed, he was wearing a gas mask for one reason only.
Exactly, Mister Harris.
Well, it's only a theory at the moment.
Oh, how nice to be trusted. But I only hope I am right.
Oh, Miss Jones. No, I'm afraid I haven't.
Well, I think it has little alternative but to attack us here.
Because this is the gas distribution centre. It'll want to gain control of it. We must find a way of attacking it's nerve centre before it does.
That's the trouble. We don't know.
No, but there is something at the back of my mind.
Yes, that is a possibility.
Yes, I was right. Someone amongst us here is under the control of the weed.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
I don't know, that's the difficulty.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, Jamie, I'm sure you're right.
I'm sorry to disillusion you, Jamie, but I don't think it was the punch that did it.
It's beginning to expand, like it did in the Tardis.
No. I should have thought of this.
I'm very much afraid so!
Right, Jamie, right back. Back, everyone back. Come along.
Miss Jones, I think it's time you went. Come along.
Well, she was here.
She was here, standing along side you.
No!
She must have gone through there.
The doors!
Open these doors! Open these doors! Try here, Jamie!
They're not, come along!
Jamie, the doors, they're heavy. I can't hold them! Jamie, hurry! Jamie! Jamie, come on! This way, in here. Hurry up, I can't hold them!
We must look for Victoria. You go that way, I'll go this.
No, I was hoping you had.
No, no, no.
Oh no. Oh no. Can I speak to him from here?
This one?
Robson. Robson. Robson, listen to me. Can you hear me?
Robson. Come back, man. Come back. Robson, don't you realise what they're trying to do to you? They're trying to control you.
Robson. Robson.
Robson. Robson!
Well, he meant exactly what he said!
Yes, they must think I'm a serious menace.
But of course.
Jamie's right. We've got to go after him.
Miss Jones, I have a feeling that Mister Robson is going to lead us to the nerve centre of the colony.
No, we can't see anything here.
The control rig complex.
We are proceeding there now.
Jamie, there's the control rig complex.
Yes, it's foam. That's the nerve centre.
Yes.
Oh yes we can, Jamie.
Come on in. The water's lovely.
Come on, Jamie.
Goodbye. Now, down the hatch.
So far so good, Jamie.
Oh yes, he said he'd hang around.
I think we'll go along down here.
Jamie, we're already in the lion's den. What we've got to concentrate on is keeping our heads out of his mouth. Now come on.
There's nowhere else she can be.
No, Jamie. Jamie! Now there's no element of surprise!
No, Jamie!
If you were hunting what would you do?
Might be. Let's be cautious just in case, hey?
Here we go.
What do you want with me?
They need me?
Don't you realise what they've done to you? They're trying to control your mind, man!
Matter will never conquer mind. It's against the law of nature!
Jamie, hurry!
Hurry, Jamie.
Scream again, Victoria!
Come along. It's time we got out of here.
No, no. I think it's all right now. The helicopter's waiting. Come along. Mind the stairs, they're slippery.
Well, where's the helicopter then?
There it is!
Probably not.
Oh Jamie, help me get this hatchway covered. We can't hang around here. The helicopter will never see us.
There's Robson's helicopter in there.
I've been dying to get my hands on one of those things. Come on. Come on.
Don't worry, Victoria. We'll soon be out of it.
Well, we're airborne, aren't we, Jamie? Anyway, Astrid Ferrier. We watched her fly one of these things.
Now, don't worry, Victoria. It's a very primitive machine, you know. It should be easy to control.
Well, that's strange.
Well, I was always under the impression that you couldn't loop the loop in a helicopter.
Right rudder.
Yes, thank you so much. Oh, just one thing. I've got it up all right and it should be comparatively simple to propel it forward. However, how do I land it?
Perhaps I can answer those questions, Mister Harris.
Well, we didn't see her, no.
You say there's not much hope. I believe there is.
Well on our way back here we stopped of at the Medicare Centre. The man that Jamie fought with in the corridor has almost completely recovered.
Yes, the weed growth on his arm has disappeared and died. He's bemused, he's dazed, but he's alive!
Noise! Sound vibrations.
Victoria discovered it.
Well, yes. You screamed.
It's her scream, her particular pattern of sound that does the trick.
Yes, very possibly. Now, before you evacuate this compound, just give me one half hour.
We make a noise, Miss Jones. We make an awful lot of noise!
But we've got to. It may be too late.
Yes, but if we can destroy the weed's nerve centre.
But we do. It's here.
Precisely. We must generate enough sound to penetrate the Control Rig.
That way. Through the pipelines. Mister Harris, this is the only way to help your wife and all those other people.
Please. Just one half hour.
Oh, thank you. Now then, Mister Price, where do all these big leads go to?
I see.
Well, if we can boost this equipment to transmit enough sound down the pipeline, we can destroy the weed's nerve centre.
Have you got a tape recorder or some such thing?
Victoria, I want you to scream.
He will record it. Make a loop of it so that we can repeat it endlessly.
Take these magnetised speakers and attach them to the pipeline over there. Jamie, give me a hand.
What's the matter, Victoria?
Oh no! Oh Victoria, that's ridiculous.
Everything depends upon you screaming.
There you are. I knew you could.
Keep away from it! Keep away!
Just a few more minutes, please, Mister Harris. The scream's ready.
And Mister Harris.
Now then, I've attached the speakers to the pipeline. Victoria's scream will be put through this.
Well, it's a little toy of my own. Together with the amplifiers, yes, it should produce a sonic laser sound wave.
Yes, passing through the pipes. It'll destroy the nerve centre of the weed.
Well unfortunately no. No, we have to do battle with that ourselves.
With these, Mister Price.
If the weed attacks us here, we simply point these at it and hope for the best. Now, for heaven's sake, don't get in the way of the speakers. The sound'll cut you to pieces. HARRIS: Look there!
Give me the other two. Let's set up another two.
Come along, no time to waste.
Here we are. That's it.
There we are.
Take this and point it at the monster, but don't get in the way of it.
Back, everybody. Onto the platform here.
Switch it on, man, switch it on! Hold that, Jamie. Which is the connector switch? The connector switch!
Come on. Switch on your speaker and point it at the creature. Switch on! Go on!
Give it a minute.
Behind you! Look behind you! The corridor!
Switch off. Price! Switch off now.
Mister Price, I think you can switch it all off now.
What about
Why don't you go and see, Mister Price.
Miss Jones, that will be more than sufficient.
What's the matter, eh?
Well, of course.
It's all right.
It's all right, they're safe.
They're safe. Listen, they're safe. Come along and see.
Oh, yes.
Well, lots of people have tried.
Oh, really. Oh, dear. There we are.
Well, no. No, as a matter of fact, we must be on our way.
Well, we haven't quiet decided yet.
Yes, I will.
Goodbye, Mister Robson. Well, I suppose I think it's time we went. Jamie. Victoria.
You don't want to come with us, do you, Victoria.
Well, I suspected as much.
Just a minute, Jamie. You mean you want to stay here and settle down. Well, if you want to, you must.
No, that's all right. Mrs Harris, I wonder if you'd mind if Victoria stayed with you for a little while. You see, she's got no parents or home and it is a bit difficult
There, thank you very much. Jamie and I will stay for another day, just in case you want to think again.
Now, Jamie. She must make up her own mind. It's her own life. It's her decision.
We are not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay. She'll be quite all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so much, Jamie.
Well, where would you like to go?
I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie.

Good morning. Oh, good morning.
My dear Mister Chinn, if I could leave, I would, if only to get away from people like you.
And your petty obsessions! England for the English! Good heavens, man!
Not to the world?
There's no point in discussing the Master. I keep telling you, he's left Earth by now.
Yes, well, er
I've no idea.
Variable mass. That's interesting.
Yes. Somewhere on the south east coast, I should imagine.
All set to destroy it, Brigadier? Whatever it is?
I see. Shoot first and think afterwards, is that it?
Hardly seems sporting, does it?
Don't you think you'd better abort? What goes up must come down again. The warheads! Abort, man, abort!
Gone? It hasn't gone anywhere, Brigadier. It's just arriving.
Artillery? Well, your missiles couldn't find their target, what chance bazookas?
As far as I can gather with these primitive instruments here, the device has buried itself deep underground. So there's not much that anybody can do about it, even if it is a bomb.
Yes, please do.
You know, I would have said that that was a heartbeat.
More of a cry for help than a threat, wouldn't you say?
Before you start annihilating the thing, why don't we just take a look at it?
Jo, I'm sorry. Not this time.
Right, Gentlemen. Shall we go in?
(faintly) Brigadier! Brigadier! Brigadier!
Yes, I suppose so. I must say, this place is full of surprises, isn't it? Let's see what else we can find.
Brigadier! Brigadier!
Well, gentlemen, there's your enemy.
Even radiation? Why then were you crippled by solar flare?
And yet you still ran out of fuel?
And unlimited power.
That's Jo! Come on!
Jo! Are you all right? What's happened?
It's all right, my dear. Don't be frightened.
Well, it's all part of the same thing, I'm afraid. You must have been hearing things.
Look, Jo, don't worry. The same thing happened to me when I first came in here.
Yes, tremendous material advantages, but I doubt if even Axonite could increase the growth of human common sense. But since you seem hell bent on getting hold of it, I suggest the best thing to do is to restrict its use to your laboratories until we've made a full analysis of all its properties.
Scientifically, yes.
Why, you do, of course!
Hmm, quite a quandary.
Why should they foist this gift onto us? They must want something. Jo, tell me again about that creature that you saw.
Yes, of course I believe you. I always did. Now then, you're quite sure it was Bill Filer that you heard?
This body they found, was there no identification?
Perhaps he got here ahead of us?
No. Perhaps the same thing happened to him.
I only hope you're right, Jo.
And this brings in the whole output of Reactor One?
With the ultimate aim of making travel in time possible?
Yes, most impressive. Much larger than my own set-up, of course.
Yes.
In Britain, no.
Elsewhere. Yes, yes, elsewhere.
Yes. As a matter of fact, that's the trouble. I can't.
Most inconvenient, actually. You know, I was thinking, if you'd really like to take a look at my Tardis, maybe I can arrange to have it brought down.
Absolutely. Perhaps we can get it operational, with the help of this stuff.
But don't you see? It's the simplest way to break it down.
Look, all we have to do is take the Axonite, put it in the light accelerator and crack it down into particles.
If it is a thinking molecule, it should analyse itself. All we have to do is switch on and read the printout.
Spectroscope? You might as well use a magnifying glass.
Oh, nothing, my dear Holmes.
Well?
It's been programmed not to. Don't you see, it's deliberately resisting analysis. Well, isn't it?
Say what?
I told you so! Particle acceleration, it's the only answer. If you're not prepared to risk your own equipment, why don't we try mine?
A certain malfunction of the drive system, yes, but the other components are all right. We could put them through the main reactor.
It's the only thing left to do, isn't it? If you could persuade the powers that be?
Right.
Filer! So you got away?
Come with you? What are you talking about?
I won't go to Axos or anywhere else with you! In any case, you're not Filer!
Doc?
Are you quite sure it isn't?
Good! Come along.
I tell you, Brigadier, they replicated Bill here.
Faked, copied, duplicated.
Look, does it matter how, Brigadier? We haven't got the time to explain.
Yes, thank you, Jo.
Bill, was the Master in Axos or not?
Which was why they sent Filer, the fake Filer, after me.
Human! They're not even humanoid!
The whole thing's just a pack of lies, Brigadier.
Yes, quite. Look, we've got to stop Chinn getting hold of that stuff.
And what is your decision?
Which are?
My dear Winser, I hope you'll forgive this unauthorised use of your precious equipment, but in case there is an accident, I'm making this recording of what not to do. I am about to place the Axonite in the light accelerator.
Now, the idea is to split off a stream of Axonite particles and accelerate them through time. In this way, we shall force it to analyse itself on the printout. Right, here goes. Reactor One activated. Accelerating. Point one. Two. Three. It's reacting. Speed of light, now!
A small experiment, that's all.
Jo, please keep back! That's Axonite in there. It's now taking the whole output of Reactor One and absorbing it. Absorbing the whole lot and using it to grow.
Don't touch that!
Yes, of course! Axons! That ship, Axonite, it's all the same thing! Don't you see we're dealing with one single living creature? Axonite was just the dormant state until I activated it.
No, it's too late. Don't you see, Filer? This stuff could endanger the entire world.
Jo, lie still! There's nothing we can do.
We're back inside Axos, and these claws or whatever you call them, they're a living part of Axos.
I wish I knew.
Oh? How?
Indeed, and what then?
Well, obviously, your plan entails some sort of time limit.
You know, Jo, I think our friend Chinn, has done the right thing for once. For the wrong reasons, of course.
Well, fortunately, he intends to confine the entire supply of Axonite to Britain.
Look, for the thousandth time, I tell you I am not a Time Lord.
Must you? Why?
I refuse to align myself to this cosmic bacteria of yours.
Jo?
No! No! No! Stop! Stop!
You cannot defy the laws of time. Give me a chance and I'll prove it to you.
Very well.
Pure mathematics cannot lie. You'll need an immense amount of power to create a time field for anything as large as Axos. (10 to the 9th power mega K-tons, apparently.)
There you are. There are your final power requirements.
You see? Just as I told you. Far in excess of your total power capacity.
Oh, all right, but I fail to see what good it will do.
How? You can't just walk in there and take it.
They're not getting the power through!
Jo!
Let's get out of here while that creature's disorientated. Come on! That's it, come on!
Hang on to me. Come on!
Jo! Stop it! Be quiet! Stop it!
The whole thing's electro-convulsing. The power's creating an electrical storm in its brain and we're going right through the centre of the trauma! Come on! Hang on!
Jo! Try and stop it!
Try and stop it! Don't let it get a grip on your brain! Don't let it get to your brain!. Listen to me! Answer me! What are three sevens?
Twenty one. Keep answering. Three sevens times four?
Minus thirty five? Think, Jo! Think, Jo!
Twice that? Twice!
Plus ten?
Divide by nine.
Divide by four.
Three sevens!
Yes! Quick!
Going somewhere?
The claws of Axos are already deeply embedded in the Earth's carcass! Soon it'll activate its nutrition cycle and the feast'll be begin. The Axonite'll cease to be dormant and it'll continue to grow, gentlemen, until every living thing is consumed.
I don't think you can stop it.
Well, we can but try, Jo. Can you commandeer the computer banks? I want to make some very complex calculations.
Good, thank you.
Brigadier, can you set up a constant watch on that spacedome?
I'm going to ask you to hand your prisoner over to me for a while.
Look, Bill, I think I can defeat Axos but I must have the Master's help.
Oh, don't worry, Jo. I'll keep him in good order all right, with this.
Actually, there isn't one.
Because if you mend the Tardis, we can both escape.
Why not? I don't want to spend the rest of my life as a heap of dust on second rate planet to a third rate star. Do you?
Certainly. After all, we are both Time Lords.
Because if you don't I shall hand you over to UNIT and you'll become a prisoner on a doomed planet.
Exactly. We either escape together or we die together.
Because the Time Lords have put a block on my knowledge of dematerialisation theory, that's why!
Yes. Well, we haven't got much time. What's your decision?
Good. Well, you're the mechanic. What's the answer?
The trigger mechanism from the light accelerator.
Yes, of course.
Well, it'd better not take too much time. Right, you get on with the repairs, I'll go and work out some course coordinates.
Just in case you were thinking of leaving without me.
Ah, thank you, Jo.
Oh, they're just some course coordinates, that's all.
Here you are. Everything ready?
Good. Yes, as a matter of fact, we are.
Drop that, Filer!
Sorry, Jo. Ah, Brigadier, just in time to say goodbye!
I'm sorry, Jo, we must.
Yes. After all, we are both Time Lords. Goodbye, Brigadier, Mister Chinn. Goodbye, Bill. Goodbye, Jo. I shall miss you.
If we're going, let's go.
This is as far as we're going for the moment.
Oh, you'll recognise it when you see it. Right, outside. Come on, out!
Well, you want your Tardis back, don't you? We can't beat Axos. We may as well join it.
That's simple. Because you are winning. And we have a proposition. You may have conquered this tiny speck in space but you've yet to conquer time.
We are prepared to give you this power on one condition. That we join forces against the High Council of the Time Lords.
By linking our drive systems. In this way, Axos will become a Tardis and the Tardis will become a part of Axos.
Look, will you stop pestering me!
That's right, yes.
Come on! Come on, you must take the load! You must!
Not if I can break through this time loop!
Well! This is a fine welcome, I must say!
Well, it's perfectly simple, Brigadier. A time loop is, er. Well, it's a time loop. One passes continually through the same points in time. Passes through the same. Yes. Well, the Axons said they wanted time travel and now they've got it.
Well, I sincerely hope he's with them.
Well, I can't be absolutely sure. I was pretty busy at the time. But I'm ninety percent certain though.
Well, pretty certain. Well, I suppose he could have got away. Just.
I simply boosted the circuits and broke free.
Well, I
No. No, I'm afraid not. No, obviously the Time Lords have programmed the Tardis always to return to Earth. It seems that I'm some kind of a galactic yo-yo!

As you come into this world, something else is also born.
You begin your life, and it begins a journey towards you. It moves slowly, but it never stops. Wherever you go, whatever path you take, it will follow. Never faster, never slower, always coming. You will run. It will walk. You will rest. It will not. One day, you will linger in the same place too long. You will sit too still or sleep too deep, and when, too late, you rise to go, you will notice a second shadow next to yours. Your life will then be over.
If you think because she is dead, I am weak, then you understand very little. If you were any part of killing her, and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I am the Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.
The equipment in that room is consistent with an augmented ultra long-range teleport. So, I'm not more than a single light year from where I was, and I'm in the same time zone.
When the sun sets, I'll be able to establish an exact position by the stars. Then you'll have a choice. Come out, show yourself, or keep on hiding. Clara said I shouldn't take revenge. You should know, I don't always listen.
Oh, what's this? Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening! What sort of a person has a power complex about flowers? It's dictatorship for inadequates. Or to put it another way, it's dictatorship. Come on! Chop, chop! The Doctor will see you now! Show me what you've got! I just watched my best friend die in agony. My day can't get any worse. Let's see what we can do about yours!
I know you. I've seen you before.
I used to know a trick, back when I was young and telepathic. Clearly, you can't make an actual psychic link with a door, for one very obvious reason. They're notoriously cross. I mean, imagine life as a door. People keep pushing past you. All of that knocking, but it's never for you. And you get locked up every night, so if you're just a little bit nice.
See, Clara? Still got it.
But I. Er, I can't actually see a way out of this I've finally run out of corridor. There's a life summed up. Oh, now this is new. I'm scared. I just realised that I'm actually scared of dying.
Something I said? What did I say?
Why did you stop?
Old. Very old. Possibly very, very old.
When I was a very little boy, there was an old lady who died. (cheek pop) They covered her in veils, but it was a hot, sunny day, and the flies came. It gave me nightmares for years. So, who's been stealing my nightmares?
What am I here for? You've known about me for a very long time, right?
So, what is it? Is it a trap? Is it a prison? No! Is it a torture chamber? Am I right? Somebody really should know better. Anyone who can put all of this together and steal my bad dreams, they should know better.
The secrets I have? No chance. No telling, not me.
DOCTOR; I told you I was scared of dying. And I wasn't lying either. Advantage, me!
Because you won't see
Sorry I'm late. Jumped out of a window. Certain death. Don't you want to know how I survived? Go on. Ask me! No, of course I had to jump! The first rule of being interrogated is that you are the only irreplaceable person in the torture chamber. The room is yours, so work it. If they're going to threaten you with death, show them who's boss. Die faster. And you've seen me do that more often than most. Isn't that right, Clara? Rule one of dying, don't. Rule two, slow down.
You've got the rest of your life. The faster you think, the slower it will pass. Concentrate. Assume you're going to survive. Always assume that. Imagine you've already survived. There's a storm room in your mind. Lock the door and think. This is my storm room. I always imagine that I'm back in my Tardis, showing off, telling you how I escaped, making you laugh. That's what I'm doing right now. I am falling, Clara. I'm dying. And I am going to explain to you how I survived. I can't wait to hear what I say. I'm nothing without an audience.
Thought I smelled it earlier. When I broke the window, I was sure. Salty air. This castle is standing in the sea.
Diving into water from a great height is no guarantee of survival. I need to know exactly how far I'm going to fall, and how fast.
Why do you think I threw the stool? (breaking glass) Fall time to impact (splash) seven seconds.
Because you won't see this coming!
The wind resistance of the stool, the atmospheric density, (the petals falling) the strength of the local gravity. (the fall of the jeweller's glass.) Am I spoiling the magic? I work at this stuff, you know? Should hit the water in about
Point zero two seconds. The chances of remaining conscious are
Can't I just sleep?
Do I have to know everything?
Clara, I can't always
It keeps coming, Clara. Wherever I go, it follows. Why? Why does it do that?
Always the teacher. What's the right question, then?
It's following me. Wherever I go, it's tracking me. Slowly though. Scary lurching. Scary. These screens, everywhere. It's showing me exactly where it is all the time, how far it's got, how near. Because it's
It's a killer puzzle box designed to scare me to death, and I'm trapped inside it. (laughs) Must be Christmas.
Another spade? Someone wants me to dig. What do you think, Clara? Is someone trying to give me a hint? What would you do?
Yes. Yes, of course you would.
Which, let's be honest, is what killed you. So, someone is trying to tell me that there's something important buried in this garden. That's almost the first thing they tried to tell me. Could be a trick. Could be one of my predecessors. Because I'm not the first prisoner here, am I! All those skulls! Wonder where they all went wrong. Building this height, creature that slow, so what? An hour.
Physics of a triangle. You lose.
So? It can set traps. That's okay. I'm good at traps.
So, where are you off to? Only one way in and one way out. Well, seeing as you're going.
No, no. That's not right.
Well, that was another close one. Or it will have been, once I've been and gone and got myself out of it. So, how am I going to do that? Come on, teacher, ask me questions!
I'm actually scared of dying.
The truth, yes. But not any old truth, Clara. This whole place is designed to terrify me. I'm being interrogated. It's not just truth it wants. That's not enough. It's confession. I have to tell truths I've never told before. That's the only thing that stops it. You see, the problem is, Clara, there are truths that I can never tell. Not for anything. But I'm scared and I'm alone. Alone, and very, very scared.
I confess.
I didn't leave Gallifrey because I was bored! That was a lie! It's always been a lie!
Not enough? You want more? I was scared! I ran because I was scared! Is that what you want me to say? Is that true enough for you?
It's funny, the day you lose someone isn't the worst. At least you've got something to do. It's all the days they stay dead.
Fifty seven minutes?
This is how my world works, Clara. I tick off the seconds as they pass.
If I draw the creature to one extreme of the castle, and I run to the other extreme, I can earn myself a maximum of eighty two minutes. Eighty two minutes to eat, sleep and work. My work is finding Room 12. (He goes through door 46) The castle wants me to. It's luring me. (He checks his notebook.) The numbering is a bit confused, (backs away from door 7) as if the rooms are all jumbled up. Maybe they move around. I saw the whole castle move, when I made the creature stop.
Every room, if I leave it long enough, reverts to its condition at the moment I arrive. It tidies up after itself.
Automated room service.
I think this whole place is inside a closed energy loop, constantly recycling. Or maybe I'm in Hell? That's okay. I'm not scared of Hell. It's just Heaven for bad people. But how long will I have to be here? Forever?
It's always coming. Always closer. The countdown never stops. But the countdown to what?
There are two events in everybody's life that nobody remembers. Two moments experienced by every living thing, yet no one remembers anything about them. Nobody remembers being born and nobody remembers dying.
Is that why we always stare into the eye sockets of a skull?
Because we're asking, what was it like? Does it hurt? Are you still scared?
Bird? What's bird got to do with it? Are there birds here?
There's something I'm missing, Clara, and I think it's something terrible.
Hello? Hello, is there someone there? Hello!
It's a trap, Clara. A lure and a trap.
I'm following breadcrumbs laid out for me. This is somebody's game, and I can't stop playing. A game everybody else has lost. I know how to move that wall, Clara, so long as I don't run out of confessions. But what I really want to know is
Who's been playing about with the stars? They're all in the wrong places, for this time zone, anyway. I
If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled seven thousand years into the future. But I do know better. So who moved the stars?
The Hybrid.
Long before the Time War, the Time Lords knew it was coming, like a storm on the wind. There were many prophecies and stories, legends before the fact. One of them was about a creature called the Hybrid. Half Dalek, half Time Lord, the ultimate warrior. But whose side would it be on? Would it bring peace or destruction? Was it real, or a fantasy? I confess, I know the Hybrid is real. I know where it is, and what it is. I confess, I'm afraid.
Of course. The last square on the board. What else would it be? The Tardis. One confession away.
Azbantium. Four hundred times harder than diamond. Twenty feet thick. The way out.
Bird?
(angry) That's when I remember! Always then. Always then. Always
Can't I just lose? Just this once?
DOCTOR; Easy. It would be easy. It would be
I can't keep doing this. I can't! I can't always do this! It's not fair! Clara, it's just not fair! Why can't I just lose?
But I can remember, Clara.You don't understand, I can remember it all. Every time. And you'll still be gone. Whatever I do, you still won't be there.
DOCTOR; Hello again. No more confessions, sorry. But I will tell you the truth.
The Hybrid is a very dangerous secret. A very, very dangerous secret and it needs to be kept!
So I'm telling you nothing. Nothing at all. Instead, I'm going to do something far worse. (punch) Argh! I'm going to get out of here, and find whoever put me here in the first place, and whatever they're trying to do, I'm going to stop it! (punch) Argh!
But it might take me a little while, so do you want me to tell you a story? (punch) Argh! The Brothers Grimm, lovely fellas. They're on my darts team. (punch) Argh! According to them, there's this emperor and he asks this shepherd's boy, how many seconds in eternity?
People always get it wrong with Time Lords. We take forever to die. Even if we're too injured to regenerate, every cell in our bodies keeps trying. Dying properly can take days. That's why we like to die among our own kind. They know not to bury us early.
I think, in my current condition, it'll take me about a day and a half to reach the top of the tower. I think. If I'm lucky, I have a day and a half.
I have to do this, Clara. It's the only way. I have to be strong. I should have known from the very beginning. Of course. The portrait of you, the creature from my own nightmares. This place is my own bespoke torture chamber, intended for me only. And all those skulls in the water. How could there be other prisoners in my Hell? The answer, of course, is there never were any other prisoners. And the stars, they weren't in the wrong place, and I haven't time travelled.


How long can I keep doing this, Clara? Burning the old me, to make a new one?
If you think because she's dead, I am weak, then you understand very little. If you were any part of killing her and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I'm the Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.
Because you won't see
If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled seven thousand years into the future.
Aah! How many seconds in eternity?
If I didn't know better, I'd say I've travelled twelve thousand years into the future.
How many seconds in eternity? And the shepherd's boy Argh!
Six hundred thousand years into the future.
Argh! How many seconds in eternity? And the shepherd's boy says Argh!
Twelve hundred thousand years into the future.
Argh! And the shepherd's boy says Argh!
Two million years into the future.
And the shepherd's boy says
Twenty million years into the future.
Ow! And the shepherd's boy says, there's this mountain of pure diamond. It takes an hour to climb it, and an hour to go around it!
52 million years.
Every hundred years, a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on the diamond mountain.
Nearly a billion years.
Argh! And when the entire mountain is chiselled away, the first second of eternity will have passed!
Well over a billion years.
Argh! You must think that's a hell of a long time,
Two billion years.
Personally, I think that's a hell of a
Aaargh!
Personally, I think that's a hell of a bird.
Go to the city. Find somebody important. Tell them I'm back. Tell them, I know what they did, and I'm on my way. And if they ask you who I am, tell them I came the long way round.
You can probably still hear me, so just between ourselves, you've got the prophecy wrong. The Hybrid is not half Dalek. Nothing is half Dalek. The Daleks would never allow that. The Hybrid destined to conquer Gallifrey and stand in its ruins
Is me.

Boo! Hello, I'm looking for a ghost.
I'm the Doctor.
If you like. And this is Clara.
Ah, but you are very different. You are Major Alec Palmer. Member of the Baker Street Irregulars, the Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Specialised in espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance behind enemy lines. You're a talented watercolourist, professor of psychology and ghost hunter. Total pleasure. Massive.
Actually, that's a like told by a very brave man involved in very secret operations. The type of man who keeps a Victoria Cross in a box in the attic, eh? But you know that, because you're Emma Grayling, the Professor's companion.
It's 1974. You're the assistant and non-objective equipment. Meaning psychic.
Health and safety. Yeah, the Ministry got wind of what's going on down here. Sent me to check that everything's in order.
Don't worry, guv'nor, I'll be out of your hair in five minutes. Oh! Oh, look. Oh, lovely. The ACR 99821. Oh, bliss. Nice action on the toggle switches. You know, I do love a toggle switch. Actually, I like the word toggle. Nice noun. Excellent verb. Oi, don't mess with the settings.
Gadget. Health and safety. Classified, I'm afraid. You know, while the back room boffins work out a few kinks.
It's telling me that you haven't been exposed to any life-threatening transmundane emanations. So, where's the ghost? Show me the ghost. It's ghost time.
Er, no, not really, sorry.
Listen, Major, we just need to know what's going on here.
You know I can't answer that.
The most compassionate people you'll ever meet, empathics. And the loneliest. I mean, exposing themselves to all those hidden feelings, all that guilt, pain and sorrow and
Yes?
Without the presence of a powerful psychic.
The Witch of the Well. So where's the well?
(sotto) You coming?
(sotto) To find the ghost.
(sotto) Because you want to. Come on.
(sotto) Eh? I'm giving you a face. Can you see me? Look at my face.
I dare you. No takesies backsies.
We ask her how she came to be whatever she is.
Because I don't know, and ignorance is, what's the opposite of bliss?
Yes. Yes, Carlisle. Ignorance is Carlisle.
Ah, the music room. The heart of the house. Do you feel anything?
Your pants are so on fire.
(sotto) What does being watched feel like? Is it that funny tickly feeling on the back of your neck?
(sotto) Then yes, a bit. Well, quite a big bit.
Cold spot. Spooky. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold.
What?
No.
It's a very loud noise. It's a very loud, very angry noise.
I don't know. Are you making it?
Yes?
Yes?
Mainly, yes, and?
Clara.
I'm not holding your hand.
Has this happened before?
Camera. Camera!
I had a little peek at your records, back at the Ministry. You've certainly seen a thing or two in your time. Disrupting U-boat operations across the North Sea, sabotaging railway lines across Europe. Operation Gibbon. The one with the carrier pigeons, brilliant. I do love a carrier pigeon.
Yes, but how does that man, that war hero, end up here in a lonely old house, looking for ghosts?
And if you could contact them, what would you say?
Ah ha. Ping!
Not what I thought she'd be.
Fun. Can I borrow your camera? Ta.
Clara!
The Tardis is like a cat. A bit slow to trust, but you'll get there in the end.
I've got one. Or I had one. I think I had one. Look around. See if you find it. Did I have one? Am I going mad?
No, not in here. How do you expect her to like you? She's soaking wet. It's a health and safety nightmare.
Nowhere. We're staying right here. Right here, on this exact spot, if I can work out how to do it.
Oh, that is good. That is top-notch.
We're going always.
Totally.
Well, it's got a verb in it. What do you think?
I think it brings out my eyes.
Back off. Hot suit. Hot, hot, hot.
About six billion years ago. It's a Tuesday, I think.
Back in a mo. Are you all right?
Okay then. Well, don't press any buttons or pull any levers or make any funny faces. Actually, don't move. Stand completely still. Don't breathe. Well, you can breathe, but shallow breaths.
Oh. What's wrong? Did the Tardis say something to you? Are you being mean?
Yes.
Yes.
The Tardis, she's time. We. Wibbly vortex and so on.
Okay, some help. Context? Cheat sheet? Something?
Yes, I suppose it is.
No. No. You're not that.
You are the only mystery worth solving.
Right, done. That's it. Gather round, gather round. Roll up, roll up.
The Ghast of Caliburn House. Never changing, trapped in a moment of fear and torment. But, what if she's not? What if she's just trapped somewhere time runs more slowly than it does here? What if a second to her was a hundred thousand years to us? And what if somebody has a magic box. A blue box, probably. What if said somebody could take a snapshot of her, say, every few million years?
She's not a ghost. But she's definitely a lost soul. Her name is Hila Tacorian. She's a pioneer, a time traveller, or at least she will be in a few hundred years.
Resolve themselves, by and large.
Well, time travel's a funny old thing. I mean, from her perspective, she crash landed three minutes ago.
She's in a pocket universe. A distorted echo of our own. They happen sometimes but never last for long.
Well, that's the best bit. We don't know yet. Shall we see?
Oh.
I don't know. Still, not to worry.
Not we, you. You save Hila Tacorian because you are Emma Grayling. You are the lantern. The rest of us are just along for the ride, I'm afraid. We need some sturdy rope and a blue crystal from Metebelis Three. Plus some Kendal Mint Cake.
What?
Ah, it's not a parallel universe. It's a pocket universe. Plus, it is collapsing. I mean, the Tardis could get in there all right, but entropy would bleed her power sources, you see? Trap her there until the entire universe decayed back into the quantum foam. Which would take about three minutes, give or take, you know.
A subset of the Eye of Harmony.
Of course you don't. Be weird if you did. I barely do myself. Right. You, sit down. All the way from Metebelis Three.
It amplifies your natural abilities like a microphone, or a pooper scooper.
A psychochronograph.
Non-psychic technology won't work where I'm going. Listen, all I need to do is dive into another dimension, find the time traveller, help her escape the monster. get home before the entire dimension collapses and Bob's your uncle.
No. Well, yes. Probably. A bit. Well, quite a lot. I don't know. It might be agony. To be perfectly honest, I'll be interested to find out.
See? The Witch of the Well! It's a wormhole! A reality well! A door to the echo universe. Ready?
Geronimo.
Hila? Hila! Hila Tacorian!
One, two, three.
Hila Tacorian, I presume.
Collapsing universe. You and me, dead, two minutes. No time complete sentences. Abandon planet.
Then run. Run!
Not that way, which means, er, probably.
You know that exit I mentioned?
I seem to have misplaced it.
This way.
Whoa.
An echo house, in an echo universe. Clever psychic. That is just top-notch.
It's looking for a way in.
Grab the rope. Give it three tugs, quick as you like.
I'll be next.
Oh, that's what that noise was. Lovely.
Oh dear.
Oh dear. Where are you?
Emma?
What do you want? To frighten me, I suppose, eh? Because that's what you do. You hide. You're the bogeyman under the bed, seeking whom you may devour.
You want me to be afraid. Then well done. I am the Doctor, and I am afraid.
So why am I still here, huh? Why not just eat me? Ha? Come on. Because you still need me.
Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across. To which I say, come on then, big boy, chase me.
Well, if that's
No.
Yes.
I needed to ask you something.
Clara.
What is she?
Yes, but what kind of girl, specifically?
And that's it, is it?
No, no, no, I can't, actually. There are fixed points in time, you see
What?
No, you can't have met but she can be your great, great, great, great, great granddaughter. Yours too, of course. But you guessed that already, didn't you. Oh. Apparently not.
Resolve themselves, by and large. That's why the psychic link was so powerful. Blood calling to blood, out of time. Not everything ends. Not love. Not always.
What about you?
Hold hands. That's what you're meant to do. Keep doing that and don't let go. That's the secret.
Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across.
I'm not holding your hand.
Oh, I'm so slow! I am slow. I'm notorious for it. That's always been my problem. But, but I get there in the end. Oh yes.
How do sharks make babies?
No, no, no. Happily!
Exactly. But birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it. Every lonely monster needs a companion.
It's the oldest story in the universe, this one or any other. Boy and girl fall in love, get separated by events. War, politics, accidents in time. She's thrown out of the hex, or he's thrown into it. Since then they've been yearning for each other across time and space, across dimensions. This isn't a ghost story, it's a love story!
Sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt the rest of your life. So. Tiny favour to ask.
I'm sorry! I understand now! I can take you to her! I can take you to a safe place far away from here! You can be together! Well, come on, then. She's waiting!
Well, hello again, you old Romeo, you. Now, here she comes.
Get ready to jump.

I have.
What's the matter, old girl? Why this compulsion for planet Earth?
A railway station.
Three o'clock, June the 11th, 1925.
It's interesting, isn't it. And no jet lag. Shall we go outside?
Oh, that would have happened if we'd been there or not. All part of Earth's history.
Come on.
Well, a place where one embarks and disembarks from compartments on wheels, drawn along these rails by a steam engine. Rarely on time.
You think so? As a boy I always wanted to drive one.
Lord Cranleigh?
We're expected?
Indeed.
That's very thoughtful of his Lordship.
Come on, you lot.
To a cricket match.
Why not?
This is Nyssa.
And Adric and Tegan.
Ah, I regret I have none.
Smutty?
Er, no, as a matter of fact.
Not bad.
Fast.
Middle stump!
Howzat!
Howzat!
Howzat!
Howzat!
How do you do.
The Master?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Well, certainly a cold drink.
Great Scott.
Well, I do have a terrible thirst. Perhaps a lemonade with lots of ice.
Well, it's very charming of you to make us so welcome.
Thank you.
It certainly is. What are you going to wear?
Adric.
Er, not quite. He's Alzarian.
Yes.
I want to be happy, but I can't be happy, till I make you
Hello?
Who's that?
Why do I always let my curiosity get the better of me?
Why didn't I leave after the cricket?
At last!
Wherever this is.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Portuguese.
Well, one of these must get me out of here.
Lady Cranleigh.
How do you do?
I'm afraid I'm lost.
I should explain.
Oh, but there is. You see, in my meanderings I've come across something rather unpleasant.
There's a body through there.
A dead man in a cupboard.
I'm afraid it's true. May I show you?
Fascinating.
A larger than average priest hole.
It's in here. Are you sure you want to look?
Yes, of course.
Do you know him?
Well
Yes, of course.
Now, if you could tell me how to get back to my room, I think it's about time I got changed.
Hmm.
Had an accident?
It's me.
I'm afraid Miss Talbot is mistaken. I've just this minute come down the stairs.
I say, look here.
Lady Cranleigh, please.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Miss Talbot is quite mistaken. I have just come down these stairs. Before that, I was. Wait a minute. Was I like this?
Well, that's it, then.
A completely logical explanation. A duplication of fancy dress. Someone else must be wearing an identical costume.
And only one murderer. Lady Cranleigh, I agreed to keep it from your guests, but I have the distinct feeling I'm in rather hot water.
Miss Talbot.
Why?
Why would I attack you? Have you done me any harm?
No, then I've no reason to harm you. And besides
Well, it wouldn't be cricket.
No, of course not.
That's a very difficult question.
No, I've never needed any.
I'm afraid if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
I'm a Time Lord.
I told you.
I travel in time and space. I have a time machine. You've read H G Wells?
Lady Cranleigh, please help me.
There's something terribly wrong here. Lady Cranleigh knows. I showed her another dead body.
I showed you a body in a cupboard up there. You and the Indian.
An Indian, with a lip. I give up.
Willingly. This way.
This one.
Where's the Indian? There was an Indian. I showed you the body of a man in there. A man of about thirty, in a white coat. A short white coat. You said he was a servant.
Well, not in there, no. With Lady Cranleigh. A South American native.
I'm not imagining all this.
Lady Cranleigh, I appeal to you. It was you who introduced me to this man.
No, the Indian.
Yes. His name was Ditoni, or something like that. You said he was a friend from Brazil.
Where the nuts come from.
I sincerely hope so.
That's very kind of you.
Accomplices?
Thank you, Lady Cranleigh, for a delightfully unexpected afternoon.
Sergeant, do we pass the station?
I mean the railway station.
Would you stop there a moment?
There's vital evidence that will prove what I'm saying is true.
Stop, and I'll show you.
There's something I'd like to show you.
It's not here.
What I wanted to show you.
This one will.
Please.
After you, Sergeant.
In this sense?
Come in.
The man in the cupboard?
I could get you there sooner.
The stairs are burning!
Tell him, Lady Cranleigh, and why he's so interested in Ann.
The black orchid for one, Latoni for another.
I'll leave Lady Cranleigh to do that. I have to rescue Nyssa.
Really. And what will he do when he discovers he has the wrong girl?
Try and hold his attention here. I'll find a way up through the house.
George, that isn't Ann. Ann is down there. Look.
Keep still, Nyssa! It's true, George. Please let me have her. Please.
Thank you. I shall treasure it.

Not hat people, are you? Either of you?
Wear them much, I mean. I only do when I go out. It's silly to have this thing getting in everyone's way.
Well, I have to start somewhere.
Ah, we must be on the outer limits. The Tardis has drifted too far into the future. We'll just slip into hover mode for a while.
I had no idea we were so far out. Veruna. That's irony for you.
Veruna is where one of the last surviving groups of mankind took shelter in the great er. Yes. Well, I suppose you've got all that to look forward to, haven't you.
All civilisations have their ups and downs.
Yes, that's enough, Turlough.
Yes.
Laws of time.
Now, we mustn't interfere. Colony's too new, one generation at the most. The future hangs in the balance. Now, I've got another one of these somewhere. Put them side by side, we'll have a pair.
Impossible. Time's up.
Knowledge has its limits. Ours reaches this far and no further.
Stabilisers are failing. Have to get out of here.
The Tardis should be able to resist this sort of thing. The console's jammed!
Gravitational pull?
Don't panic.
My least favourite sort of weather.
Come along.
It's all right.
Leave it to me.
I shall need some antiseptic and bandages.
To clean this wound.
It would help if we could see what we're doing.
Phosphor lamps.
Better hold it steady then, hadn't you.
Stop that, would you? Is this the best you can do?
We need some proper lighting. Turlough, the Tardis. I'll need the portable mu-field activator.
And five of the argon discharge globes.
Oh, and all medical supplies.
Yes, you'd better give him a hand, Tegan.
Time for social niceties later. Better get started, hmm?
Yes, good idea.
I'm not helping, officially. And if anyone happens to ask whether I made any material difference to the welfare of this planet, you can tell them I came and went like a summer cloud.
Perhaps you could ask them to move. They're rather blocking the air. It's interesting. How often do you have meteorite showers?
Yes. The attacks?
Really? With whom?
Not if I have anything to do with it. How do you do? I'm the Doctor.
Hello. You've been keeping us unnecessarily in the dark, Mister Range. You didn't tell me you had a hydrazine steam generator.
It's very interesting.
What about the colony ship? Must have been brimming with gadgetry.
What happened to it all?
Hmm?
The Tardis? No, no, no. Probably just some spatial anomaly. You're getting carried away again, Turlough. One thing at a time. Where's the mu-field activator?
It's behind the interior door. Yes, of course. Excitation.
Oh, it's risky, but then so is operating in this gloom. Have you ever tried putting a higher voltage across one of these things?
Yes. There must be something on this planet capable of sustaining a steady voltage.
Hmm, someone else thinks this is their territory.
So you did nothing to provoke an attack.
Dangerous, surely, out in the fields with the risk of bombardment.
Thirty years? Your unknown invaders are certainly taking their time.
Look, I'm not really here at all, officially. And as soon as I've helped Mister Range with arrangements, I'll be on my way.
Going, yes, coming, no. We were forced down.
I'm sorry, we didn't know there was a war on. At first we thought it was some sort of meteorite storm.
I think your shelters are totally inadequate and your warning system does nothing but create panic.
Your population has already fallen below critical value required for guaranteed growth and you're regularly losing new lives. I think, and you did ask what I think, I think your colony of Earth people is in grave danger of extinction.
Absolutely. I wish you all the luck in the world. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to give you anything much in the way of help.
I'm sorry, I was working out a way of getting some decent light in here.
If I had a spare millennium I might bring you up to date on time mechanics. Unfortunately, we have this lighting problem and a ward full of people needing medical attention.
What, again?
You know, we can sort all this out in no time at all if everyone just stays calm. Now please, come and see the Tardis. As an invasion weapon it's about as offensive as a chicken vol au vent.
It's lack of armaments can be an embarrassment at times. Just a minute. Get back!
Oh, well, this way.
Oh dear, what have we here?
Now, what's this?
Brilliant! Take it inside. Hurry along.
Now, where's the mu-field activator?
Yes, indeed, in the Tardis.
A swift exit, I think. We've had enough of this planet.
The attack's nearly over. Let's get out of here. Come on, the Tardis.
The Tardis has been destroyed.
Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation.
Be careful, Norna.
Best do as they say. We'll be safe as long as we remain calm. Now trust me.
In time, if you let me investigate. If, on the other hand, you're going to kill me, you'd better get on with it.
This wasn't what I had in mind at all.
Oh, just residual energy from the Tardis.
What, the precious rocks under the soil business? Well, so would I. Whatever's going on here has put paid to my Tardis.
If it is war, and I'm not so sure about that, then you and I, Plantagenet, are in the same shell hole. Now, does anyone know where these are coming from?
This rock analysis. You've been investigating the whyfors. I think you should be looking into the where froms. Mister Range tells me you have a research room.
Well, if you want answers, you'd better unseal it.
You've been inside it?
The trouble is, if these good people don't want us inside.
Yes, er, careful with that thing.
Well, here we are then. This should keep us busy.
Turlough, you can help.
Good, good. I want to run a series on halides and silica. And do stop waving that thing around.
I think this joke's gone far enough.
Medical centre, quickly!
Delayed effect of a glancing blow.
Now, I want you to stay here and start those tests.
Tegan! Ah. Those wires.
Rip them down.
Jolly good. Now you can rip them down again. Damp cloths. Anything damp.
Fibrillating.
Are we ready?
Now!
Again!
I admit it was touch and go for a minute.
Try to get some rest.
Not a word to the Time Lords.
After thirty years of bombardments, yes, I take your point.
The democratic touch, eh?
Now, what's making you so vulnerable to attack is the thin atmosphere on Frontios.
Yes, I have some theories about that, and with your permission I'll return to the Research room and confirm them.
Tegan.
Then perhaps you'll come with me, Mister Range.
Good. See you later.
You know, Mister Range, if I'm right these so-called missiles of yours are nothing more or less than natural meteorites.
Oh, it's unusual, I grant you, but one of the planets in the Veruna system may have disintegrated with long term fall out.
I think he did.
What puzzles me is how it managed to crash in the first place with all that autonomous guidance on board.
What, before the crash?
Did they now. I see why you call it the day of catastrophe.
Ah, the rock analysis. They look like Widmanstaatten patterns to me, which would seem to confirm that
What's the matter?
Turlough wouldn't risk an unsafe tunnel.
What sort of something?
You will, Mister Range, by staying here. These sort of adventures depend on a well-manned home base.
I thought you were supposed to be guarding the rear.
Oh well, a risk shared is a risk doubled. Come along.
Shush.
Listen.
Turlough, Turlough.
Mister Range, look after Turlough. I'm going on alone.
So they're Tractators.
No, Tegan, get back!
Get her out of here. I'll hold them off.
Out!
Oh, no. On the other hand, with a touch of spin.
How's that?
Ah, the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.
It's like walking through treacle.
No, stay back!
Some sort of gravity beam from the Tractators.
No, no, stay back. Get everyone back to the research room!
Oh, I am. Lots of things. Nothing that quite fits the gravity of the situation.
Give me that.
Wait until we're closer.
Hold on. Now!
Better get out of here.
I suspect Turlough can help us with that, as soon as we get back
Get back.
Against the wall. There are more of them.
There's someone up there it wants to get down.
I'm going to try an experiment.
Well, sometimes it's easier to look for the way in and then work backwards.
Oh, but they aren't.
What do you make of these?
Hmm. These chippings have recently been machined from these walls.
Functionally advanced ones, at that. They're creating an extensive and elaborate tunnel system. Oh, insect-like they may be, but they're no ordinary insects. They have highly refined powers of abstract reasoning. These Tractators must be very intelligent beings indeed.
You're never without a sense of direction while there's an air flow. Air flows from A to B. Usually you want to be at B. Or at A.
Yes, well, I think you can forget about the Tardis. It's probably scattered in little pieces across the whole of Frontios. Yes.
Wait. That's the sound.
The machine that did this.
It seems to be coming this way.
Tractators dead ahead.
No one is, Tegan, so shush.
Excavating machine or Tractators. Take your pick.
It's a bit of a problem this, Tegan.
Not exactly. There's a living mind enslaved in the middle of that lot.
It's Captain Revere.
How do you do. I'm the Doctor. Oh. Er, this is Tegan.
Then perhaps you won't mind telling us who you are.
Hmm. Well, you could be right, Gravis.
Ah, not any more than any other Time Lord. You like travel?
Yes, I'd better put you right on one thing, Gravis. The Time Lords didn't send me to investigate. Gallifrey operates a policy of strict non-intervention these days. And besides, Frontios is completely outside our normal sphere of influence.
We mustn't take the narrow viewpoint, Tegan. After all, Gravis and his friends were here long before the Earth colonists.
Slight communications problem here, Gravis. My assistant hasn't been programmed in the ways of the world. Please forgive the naivety.
I'm terribly embarrassed about all this.
It must be the humidity causing the malfunction. These serving machines are perfectly reliable on Gallifrey.
Oh, you think so? I got it cheap because the walk's not quite right. And then there's the accent, of course. But, when it's working well, it's very reliable. Keeping track of appointments, financial planning, word processing, that sort of thing.
Yes, he seems dead enough.
Ah, yes, if I could just inspect the linkages.
Oh! Yes, it's very efficient, Gravis. You certainly know your mechanics.
No shortage of spare parts either, eh?
Oh, but it is for the bombardment, isn't it, Gravis? No accident that.
You know, I guessed as much. Useful asteroid belt up there, some additional gravity beams down here, and you're knocking them over like ninepins.
Oh, not chance, eh, Gravis?
Their gravity beams again. Which explains why the colony ship's systems failed before the crash.
Oh, they gave you ten years to establish yourselves, and then they started making their collection.
(sotto) I'm here to help you.
(sotto) You'll have to trust me. When the time comes, do exactly as I say.
I was rather wondering that myself.
Yes. Yes, I've been wondering why you need such a fine polish. More of your gravitational engineering, I suspect.
Do you know I think I can guess, Gravis. The tunnels act as wave guides. You're concentrating your gravitational forces.
Why? The combined power would be astronomical.
No, no, no, stay back.
Please, there are far too many of them.
Well, theoretically it's highly complex. Practically
No, no, just stunned. We'll have to work quickly.
Careful!
Quick! Come on, you two! We're getting out of here.
Get off, Turlough! Pull yourself together!
Brazen!
Give me your hand!
Yes, all in good time, Turlough.
Well, that sounds promising. Put the two things together, we may find a way of stopping them.
I think it's time we left. Come on.
Well, these aren't Tractator tunnels. We should be safe here for a while. Keep watch that end.
Now, what do we know about these creatures?
Yes they're building a gravity motor.
Hmm, steer it through the galaxy under the power of gravity.
And breed. Infesting new planets. Nowhere in the universe will be safe from them.
No, no, Tegan, it's too late! Follow me.
Glad you could join us.
Turlough, Plantagenet and I have been working out a plan.
Oh, I rather hoped they would be.
Hmm. Apparently they're not really dangerous.
Well, that's it. Now, this should either sort out this whole Tractator problem and repair the Tardis.
Or it won't. I suggest you all get under cover.
Yes, quite. I'd, er, I'd like to negotiate a surrender.
Oh, absolutely. You can have it all. Frontios, its unhappy occupants, the lot. I don't think it's fair for us Time Lords to interfere.
Why should we let a bunch of stuffed shirts deprive you of your own form of transportation? Hmm? However primitive.
Well, in comparison to Gallifreyan time technology, of course. But then, what isn't?
What, this? Oh, yes, well, as I was saying, you can have Frontios, all the fixtures and fittings appertaining thereunto, and I'll pull my Tardis together and get off your patch.
Well, it's not all here at the moment, you understand. It's, er it's been spatially distributed to optimise the, er, the packing efficiency of, er, the real time envelope.
Yes, yes, indeed. Well, as you can see, from this panel, Gravis, I control all of the main Tardis functions. The time coordinates, spatial coordinates, all inoperative at the moment, of course, because the spatial distribution circuits are switched in.
Ah. Now, you really will have to be more careful, Gravis. Now the autoscan's picking up all the locations of the concealed Tardis components. Oh, well, not to worry. I shouldn't think it's even within your powers to reassemble them. Besides, what would you want with an old Type Forty Time and Relative Dimension in Space machine, hmm?
Oh. No, Gravis, please. Take everything else but leave me the Tardis.
Oh no, Gravis, please, I beg you! Spare me the Tardis!
Shush. This isn't the time to disturb his concentration.
Brace yourselves.
It's kill or cure.
For you and me, maybe, but when the Gravis really wants something.
With a bit of luck, any moment the plasmic outer walls of the Tardis will seal.
If your theory is correct, Turlough, the vital link between the Gravis and his Tractator chums. Hold on!
Oh, no, no, but quite harmless, and as long as we keep him isolated from the other Tractators, he'll stay that way.
Well, the first thing we'll do is drop him off on some uninhabited planet.
Well, that's that. The Gravis is safe and well on the uninhabited planet of Kolkokron, exercising his animal magnetism on the rocks and boulders.
Alone but in good hands, Plantagenet. Speaking of which, I know it's not much, but, a farewell token.
Oh no, no. Far too much repair work of my own to be done. Besides, time and the time laws don't permit it. There's an etiquette about these things which we've rather overlooked, I'm afraid.
Yes, quite. Don't mention it.
Now listen, you two. If the Time Lords ever hear about our little trip to Frontios, there'll be serious trouble.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with them.
No, no, no, leave them. They're all right.
Oh no, this is something much more powerful. We're being pulled towards the middle of the universe. I'm trying to pull against it.
I don't know. I think we're about to find out.

Yes.
Hmm? This says everything has stopped, but the ship.
Covered with static. Let's try it again, Susan.
Yes, or a magnetic field.
No, I shan't be happy until I've solved this little mystery.
You're still thinking about the experiences you had with the Aztecs.
Yes, it all started out as a mild curiosity in a junkyard, and now it's turned out to be quite a, quite a great spirit of adventure, don't you think?
Yes, and that extraordinary quarrel I had with that English king, Henry the Eighth. You know, he threw a parson's nose at me.
Threw it back, of course. Take them to the Tower, he said. That's why I did it.
Of course, it was long before you appeared on the scene. However, now, let us get back to this little problem. Open the door, Susan.
Yes, yes. Plenty of fresh air, temperature normal.
Precisely.
It's a spaceship. Close the door, Susan. Let us be careful. There's been some kind of catastrophe here.
I never make uninformed guesses, my friend, but certainly that's one answer. Oh, dear, dear, dear, what a tragedy you know. She's only a few years older than Susan.
Why?
Chesterton, have you noticed anything about this watch? (and the man's) Neither of them are working. These are the non-winding type. A movement of the wrist recharges the spring inside for twenty four hours.
Yes, then suppose we say that they've only just stopped. Now that would mean that the last movement of their wrists would be at least twenty four hours ago.
It doesn't make sense, does it. But the facts are all here. I think it would be wise if we returned to the ship and left these people. There's nothing we can do for them.
Come along, open the door, Susan.
Tell me, are you from the Earth?
No. No, Barbara. I learned not to meddle in other people's affairs years ago. (Ian laughs) Now, now, now, don't be absurd. There's not an ounce of curiosity in me, my dear boy. Tell me, why are you in danger?
You mean they have some kind of power over your craft.
Hypnosis, do you mean?
Well, what then?
John?
You have additional crew, I take it?
Well, it seems to me that there's nothing else I can do. Goodbye, my friend. Bye, bye, my child. Come along, Susan.
Oh? Perhaps it's coming from inside the Tardis.
Good gracious! They've taken the lock!
And disturb the field dimensions inside the Tardis? We dare not. We've been most effectively shut out.
Who else?
I don't know. And why have they kept those other two in captivity, hmm?
What is happening, my friend? Can't you control the ship?
Which is your parallel thrust?
Right. Velocity, Chesterton. Check velocity.
Please go away.
Right, stabilisers, Maitland.
Oh, at last. At last. The ship was rolling about on its axis.
Where's your deflection rays? Maitland! Deflection rays.
Well, we'll see about that. We'll see about that. Reading, please.
Jet. Jet course. Port. Now.
Jet reverse. Starboard. Now.
Barbara, see that panel? Check status. Three lights normal.
Boost engines. Forward thrust and lock.
Well, my friend, are you feeling better?
Yes, well, I rather fancy that's settled that little bit of solution. You know, I think these Sensorites have found a way to take control of your minds.
No, no, I don't. I think it was an exercise in fear and power.
Yes, and you found a way to resist them, whereas Maitland here, his power to resist was taken from him.
Yes, they're dangerous and cunning, these people. But that's not all. Things are very strange here. You know, they can control, they can frighten and yet they don't attempt to kill you. Furthermore, they feed you and keep you alive. All this is most extraordinary.
Tell me, have either of you ever met any of these creatures or seen them?
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Oh? Why not?
You're both being rather secretive.
Can't you go faster? Susan's in there.
Now what is it? Get on with the job, please.
Anything but this awful waiting.
I don't know. They must have made the journey before. They were here before, remember? They took away the lock mechanism from my ship.
Yes, and now they're coming back, with what orders? To take over our minds? Hmm? Or to kill us?
What's that noise?
My dear Chesterton. It's our minds that they take over, so we must presume that the brain is all important. Now let our own intelligence be our own defence, and attack.
Steady, Chesterton. The calmer you are, the stronger.
Maitland. Maitland! Can you hear me? Fear, my boy. It's loosened his mind. It gives the Sensorites a chance to control it.
Oh, ignore it. Maitland!
There's work to be done, my boy. Work. Understand?
Yes, a door to be opened.
Danger on the other side.
Good, good, good.
Now, now, now. Try and contain your emotions. Use self-control. Otherwise it confuses the brain and leaves it wide open to an attack by the Sensorites. Look at Maitland here. Fear and inertia left him vulnerable.
But that can't be where Barbara and Susan are now?
But that man John's with them.
Yes, it might be possible for Susan's thoughts to reach out to the Sensorites.
Yes. And there's that friend of yours, you know. John. We must look after him. Let me see now. Of course, they have a hold of his mind, you know.
Yes, I wonder. Did Susan release the pressure?
Yes, and that was a dangerous thing to do, child. Because you were strong-willed and without fear, they didn't harm you.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I
Yes. What were John's duties?
I see. And now they're trying to do the same to us. We must get the lock of the Tardis back. Have you tried talking to them?
Yes, we must try. We must.
So I see.
Would you like to look at that graph for a moment?
(having looked through a notebook) I just don't understand. There must be a clue here somewhere. There must be.
Yes. That's very interesting. May I?
Excuse me.
What? What is this? What was it Chesterton said? Rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Yes. Of course. Of course! I know what he found.
Molybdenum. It's here, in the graph, but it's all mixed up with the lines so it doesn't make obvious reading.
Yes.
Yes. It's used as an alloy in steel. In fact this machine would be useless without it. Now let me see. Iron melts at one thousand five hundred and thirty nine decrees centigrade, and molybdenum melts at two thousand six hundred and twenty two degrees centigrade. So, you know, we've some idea. Yes, I see now just what John found. I wonder if he was excited. Yes, that planet must be full of it. Full of it! It's a veritable gold mine!
The sick member of the crew. Try him.
Do as I say.
This is all very well, but I think we should try and contact them.
Agree? To what? What are you talking about, child?
Are you saying you've made contact with them?
Well of course we shall see them, but they must agree not to harm us.
If they try to harm us then I shall fight them.
Speak up. I can't hear you.
What is it you want of us? Why don't you let these space people go back to their Earth, hmm?
So Earth men have visited the Sensphere.
These people cannot possibly accede to your request. It's out of the question.
My party does have a choice, and I assure you we have no intention of spending the rest of our lives with you.
Now listen to me, both of you. You've taken the lock of my ship and I want it returned immediately.
I don't make threats. But I do keep promises. And I promise you I shall cause you more trouble than you bargained for if you don't return my property!
So they might have been referring to Susan.
Next time, if there is a next time, they might try and control your mind, my child. Like they've done to these two people.
No, not unless they return what they stole from my ship.
Oh, my dear, they're not invincible. Oh, no, no, no. Did any of you notice the peculiarity in their eyes?
It's a fallacy, of course, that cats can see in the dark. They can't. But they can see better than we humans, because the iris of their eyes dilates at night. Yes.
Oh, it's all perfectly simple, Chesterton. You see, the Sensorites eyes are the exact opposite to that of a cat. The Sensorites eyes were completely dilated, that is, enormous, in light.
Exactly. And that is our best weapon. The Sensorites will be frightened of the dark.
I very much doubt, my child, whether they can see in the semi-darkness.
Naturally.
My dear Barbara, wouldn't you be afraid if you couldn't see your enemies, hmm? Thank you for your admiration, dear boy. Thank you.
Telepathy. You know, telepathy isn't only a prerequisite of the Sensorites. I know sometimes what you're thinking.
My dear. What?
Well, what's the message, child?
Agree? To what?
There can't be air outside the spaceship.
We must!
Do you think I don't understand? Trust is a two-sided affair.
If you go with them, then they will have all the advantage.
I'm sorry, Susan, but I don't believe you have the ability to represent us. That's all.
You will do as you're told, Susan. Come here.
This instant!
Now, Chesterton.
Susan, go and join Carol. Wait there. I want to talk to you.
Put on the light, Chesterton. You could have been left here in the darkness. We have power over you, but we don't intend to use it. Only in our defence.
Nothing that isn't ours.
What's that? Speak up!
Well?
Oh, I won't put up with this nonsense. If they try anything, put the light out again.
Dictated to by petty thieves and my own grandchild!
What is all this, setting yourself against me, hmm?
Oh, I know you thought you were doing your best, child, in the circumstances, but I think I'm a better judge of that.
My dear girl, the one purpose in growing old is to accumulate knowledge and wisdom, and to help other people.
If you behave like one, yes.
Yes, and I assure you we shall make good use of that fact, but not without discussions. You will not make decisions on your own accord. Now, do you understand? Is that quite clear? Well, is it?
Oh, Susan, Susan.
Yes, and it's a good thing you can't read the anger in mine. In all the years my granddaughter and I have been travelling, we have never had an argument. And now you have caused one.
Good, good. Now let's work together and see if we can't get the lock of the Tardis back, hmm?
Very well, I'd like to talk to him, face to face. I want to arrange the release of this spaceship. Tell him we're not pirates or plunderers. There's only one treasure we desire from him.
Freedom.
Before we make this journey, one or two questions.
These discs you wear round your neck. You press them to your forehead and you speak or hear through your mind, hmm?
Otherwise, you communicate as we do.
Yes, I see. Quite remarkable. Then you use telepathy to blanket out the minds of the spaceship's crew, hmm?
I merely want to know why you attacked Maitland and the others.
Yes, rich in minerals, yes, quite. Go on.
Yes, some kind of disease I imagine, Chesterton.
Ah ha! I thought so. Yes, yes, yes, some kind of bargaining ahead of us.
Yes, provided we can produce our side of the bargain. That's the whole point of the issue. Well, my dear. Reluctant as I am to leave you, I'm afraid we have no alternative.
Oh, I shall manage. Come along my boy. Susan.
Susan. We can't do without you. Can we?
I'm glad to have left those silent people.
It must be explained to them. The disease, if that's what it is, isn't anybody's fault. Besides, there's cures and preventives.
You make it sound so very simple.
Not like who, John?
It doesn't alter the fact that you're responsible for his condition. I think it's utterly disgraceful.
Facts? What facts, sir?
Very well.
Molybdenum.
Vintage water.
Now, sir, let us talk of the future. Our future.
And the ordinary people?
Yes. Does it affect the Elders?
I wonder why not?
Yes, it, er, might be a clue. But what I hope, sir, was this er, that if my friends and I succeed where your scientists failed, will you return the lock of my ship?
Yes, she's a fine young woman. My dear Chesterton, are you all right?
Is this a symptom of your disease?
Why has it happened to him and not to us?
Never the Elders?
It's incredible. The build-up in body temperature. This disease, as you call it, is it contagious?
I wonder. Is it a germ in the air?
I agree with you.
Yes, yes, yes.
No. No, no, no, no, no. You had some of it.
I know. He drank a different kind of water. It's the water!
Well, it depends on their resistance. In time, of course, all will succumb.
No, I can't. This is all we have to go on. Send for your servant, please.
It's all right, Chesterton. Rest quietly. This isn't a disease, it's more like poison.
Oh, go to your scientists now. I want some sodium chloride and I want it quickly.
Please, please.
Now, sir, your indulgence.
Well, we must make sure no one drinks anything but the crystal water.
Fine. And can I work with your scientists?
Splendid, splendid.
As long as that? Then we have time. I have chemicals and equipment on my ship. Return the lock and I promise you, sir, I will not only cure my young friend but all your people.
Ah, good.
Well do not delay any longer than is necessary, please. Thank you. Now, salt and water, Susan. An old-fashioned remedy but I'm sure it'll serve. Thank you. Now, my boy.
Come along, old chap.
Yes, now I want you to drink all of this. It isn't going to be pleasant, but it's all for your own good.
That's it.
Will they let me into my ship?
But he'll die!
Just look at that young man. I've done all I can for him at the moment. Given him salt and water. He's been coughing his heart out. I must have chemicals and equipment. His death will be your fault, and yours alone.
What is it now?
Do you really mean you can hear their minds talking, Susan?
Don't set yourself against me.
You fool!
It's inhuman.
Just monstrous.
Theory?
I know we have no alternative, but such outrageous behaviour! Oh, forget it, child. Now, I want you to stay here and act as nurse. Watch his pulse rate, will you, and let me know immediately
How are you feeling?
Any pains elsewhere?
Yes, well, you just rest there quietly. Yes, we'll let him have all the crystal water he wants, and if his breathing gets febrile, artificial respiration. Now, sir. Your laboratory. And I only hope there's time to save him.
Yes, well, I have to say, very comprehensive. Now, gentlemen, time is not on our side. I believe your people have been dying because there is atropine poison in the aqueduct water. Now, allow me. I've made a few notes here which might interest you. Now these are the symptoms. Atropine causes dilation of the blood vessels. Temperature rises and pulse rate becomes very rapid. A rash may appear. The mouth and throat both become extremely dry. Now what we have to do is this, gentlemen. Isolate the poison and then prescribe the remedy.
Good.
Yes, well then we must try again.
Ah, yes. You know, a strange thing here is, not all your people died.
Yes, of course some may be able to resist it or perhaps some of the water is good.
Yes, but surely from different outlets?
Well, gentlemen, there's a poison at work here. I know the signs. Now what you must do is to test samples from each and every district. Where did that come from?
I see. Well now, I suggest that you sample that bottle, and mark it and then start keeping records. And there's not a moment to lose. And remember, I want samples from all the outlying districts. It's imperative.
This one! I've found it. And just as I suspected, atropine poison. That's why your people have been dying off.
Because it varies from place to place, and when you made your tests, you didn't discover it.
Yes, but a happy tiredness, my dear. How's our friend?
Yes, you must expect that. Ah, my friend. You've prepared the antidote?
Splendid. Now I think we ought to start making this in large quantities. Will you please see that that goes to the First Elder's room? Give it to my granddaughter, Susan.
Yes, well now we shall soon be off this planet.
Oh, courage, my dear. Courage. Of course, I'm rather baffled with this atropine poison, because it only seems to appear in one part of the city or rather one reservoir at a time. It's curious.
Oh, yes, that's a cure all right, but then why cure something when we can stamp it out, hmm?
What's that, my friend?
I don't know. He might be more lucid, you know, than one should imagine. Now I'm going off on an expedition, and I want you to take note of what he says.
You see, he knows his name. Now you stay with him. I think he's getting better, and I'm sure you're going to have a great future between you, later on. Now, after my little exploration
I'm going to find the First Elder, Scientist, rather, and we're going off on an exploration. It isn't dangerous, of course. But when I have solved my problem I'm sure we shall all be out of trouble.
It's very gloomy.
But that must make it rather difficult for you. The Sensorites dislike darkness, don't they?
Well, it may be because you've neglected it that the water's become poisoned.
Return? I don't want to return. I haven't just come here for a look. I'm going in there.
And why?
Oh, but I have a torch.
Indeed? Are there?
And not seen them?
Yes, I think you should return to the laboratory. I shall be all right. Leave it to me, will you? I assure you.
How very convenient. Yes. Noise and darkness. The two things the Sensorites dislike. There's more in this than meets the eye.
Is it? Yes. I thought so. Atropa Belladonna. Deadly Nightshade.
Keep away!
Yes, strange indeed when you realise that I was at the mercy of that creature. It was so dark in there it was invisible and it knocked me to the ground.
No, no, no. Something hit me under the heart and it was most unpleasant. It was a good thing I sent you that antidote. Otherwise I might have been in a much worse state than I was.
What?
Then it's true. True. The water, and those monsters in there, and now it appears that there's someone among the Sensorites that bear us ill-will. That's two separate enemies.
No, no, no, no. No, don't mistake me. The water and those monsters are distinctly connected. I've more or less solved that problem. But this Sensorite who's against us is a much greater danger. Now I suggest we go back and try and find out which one it is.
You've been exerting yourself, boy, and naturally you're weak.
Now, now, you must do as you're told, and that is that. Isn't that one of the Elders?
Take it easy. I want a word with him. I say, you, sir. Sir, I'd like a word with you.
Most extraordinary. He ran away from me!
I can assure you he was very mobile, my child. Come along, let's get into the First Elder's room. Come along.
Yes, strange indeed, sir. I tried to talk to him and he ran away.
My dear sir. That's most civil of you. I ruined my jacket down in the aqueduct, but of course I have others on my ship. Thank you.
Beau Brummell always said I looked better in a cloak.
Yes, I did that, but I didn't kill him.
Just what I was thinking. Yes, of course, we have no wish to interfere in your affairs, but the City Administrator appears to have all the qualifications.
Certainly, sir. My companions and I will pay a visit to the man John, and note his progress.
Well, well. What a happy scene.
I'm glad to see you don't bear a grudge against the Sensorites for the past.
Splendid. Now sir, the antidote. I wonder if
And what is this little collection of things here?
I see.
Yes, now just a moment. This is rather important. This is a rough plan of the aqueduct.
Is that so?
Oh, yes. I have a couple of questions for him.
Very valuable, very valuable.
What about him? What about him?
If this is true what you say, Susan, there's trouble ahead for us. That Sensorite has power now.
Yes, I quite agree. And the only way to get that proof is to go back into the aqueduct. What about Susan?
A good idea.
Yes, thank you.
Yes, and what we propose to do, sir, is to go down into the aqueduct, find your enemies and stop them.
Thank you. We're making progress.
I wonder, sir, could I ask you a small favour?
We have a companion, a young lady, on the ship. Is it possible for her to be brought down here in the Sensphere?
Splendid, sir. Splendid.
Careful.
Yes, yes, splendid. And remember, dear boy, that I shall be standing nearly next to you. I've never liked weapons at any time. However, they're handy little things. Tell me, how long does this paralysis last?
Fine, fine. These weapons are splendid, sir. And without a doubt they'll help us to make success.
Yes, and that brings me to another problem. My granddaughter, Susan. She's bound to want to come with us.
No, I quite agree with you, my boy. We must go and not tell her, and save any arguments. I wonder, sir, would you mind keeping a small secret until we're well and truly away?
Yes, thank you. After all, there's no danger now we have these protectors, and I'm sure we can settle our little business in an hour or two.
Oh, excellent, excellent, my dear sir.
Are you quite sure you're up to it?
Splendid. Lead the way. Sir.
It's only one of our troubles, dear boy. Look at this map. It's no good to us. Look, all the lines have been altered. Somebody's been jiggering around with it.
Yes, in time. But have we got that time? Remember, we brought no food with us and the only water available is that poisoned water out there with Deadly Nightshade. A charming outlook.
Courage, my boy, both hands. Come on.
Are you sure?
It looks like a shoulder flash. I-N-E-E-R. Yes, just as I suspected. It must be one of those survivors from the spaceship that exploded.
To hide and poison the water.
Let's go and ask him.
No, no, my boy. No, no, no, no. I'm marking these, the sections, the pipes.
Yes. Perhaps they're preparing an ambush.
I assure you, dear boy, my spirits couldn't be higher. Collecting evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, calculating it, pursuing it until it's inevitable. It's fascinating.
Oh, don't interrupt, young boy. It's most irritating.
Chesterton.
Yes, well, it's all right. Let's back up and perhaps we can jump out on them.
Yes. Don't do anything to alarm them.
We came to find you.
Dead?
Yes.
Wouldn't you like to leave these tunnels and go out into the sunshine again?
Yes, I thought there'd be a third.
Oh, yes, definitely.
In case we have to make a run for it, my boy.
We have a surprise for you. The war with the Sensorites is over.
Oh, yes.
So you had to blow up your spaceship.
That's quite understandable, isn't it, Chesterton.
I'm afraid you misjudged us, sir. These people are part of the committee, here to welcome you. We all came down here to take you out again to the surface.
Yes, you deserve it, sir. So do your men. And I think the sooner we take you out into the sunshine, the better.
It's all over now.
Pitiful fellow. Oh, I know he did your people incalculable harm.
No.
Yes, but the fact is, you didn't kill him. Shows great promise for the future of your people.
Where are those other two, hmm?
What's the matter, my child?
Oh, I don't know. It's rather a relief, I think. After all, no one likes an eavesdropper about, do they. No, I think you obviously have a gift in that direction. When we get home to our own place, I think we should try and perfect it.
I don't know, my dear. This old ship of mine seems to be an aimless thing. However, we don't worry about it, do we? Do you?
Good, good.
Always last. I very nearly went off without you.
Let's have a look at Maitland and see him off, shall we?
Implying I don't?
So, you think I'm an incompetent old fool, do you?
Since you are so dissatisfied, my boy, you can get off the ship. At the very next place we stop, I shall take you off myself, and that is quite final. Carry on.

Viva Las Vegas!
No. No, this is much better.
A sinking Soviet submarine!
Ah! Sideways momentum. You've still got sideways momentum!
Your propellers work independently of the main turbines. You can't stop her going down but you can manoeuvre the sub laterally. Do it!
Geographical anomaly to starboard. Probably an underwater ridge.
Look, we have just a chance to stop the descent if we settle on it. Do it!
Or this thing is going to implode.
I'll hold you to that. Might come in handy.
Oh, yes.
Possibly. Very dangerous time, Clara. East and West standing on the brink of nuclear oblivion.
Lots of itchy fingers on the button.
Sort of, but there are flash points and this is one. Hair, shoulder pads, nukes. It's the Eighties. Everything's bigger. I would like a receipt, please.
Clara!
Clara!
No! No, no, no, no, no, no. No, not now!
Captain, we didn't attack of your ship out here. Now we need to get the pumps working to get her afloat.
If it comes.
All right, Captain, all right. You know what? Just this once, no dissembling, no psychic paper, no pretending to be an Earth Ambassador.
Doctor, me and Clara, time travellers. Clara, you okay?
We arrived here out of thin air. You just saw it happen.
Your problem, mate, not mine.
Yes.
We sank.
Never mind that. Listen. Captain, breath's precious down here. Let's not waste it, eh?
Exactly! Number one priority, not suffocating.
Eh? Ah. Oh, thank you. Finally seeing sense. Now, what sort of state is the sub in?
What about the radio? Can we send a
What!
What is that? Gas? Could be gas.
Ah. It never rains but it pours.
It's not a mammoth.
It's an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars. And we go way back. Way back.
I'm always serious. With days off.
Just keeping it light, Clara. They're scared.
No, no, no, no, no, no! Please, please. Wait, just. There is no need for this. Just hear me out. You're confused, disorientated. Of course you are. You've been lying dormant in the ice for, for, for how long? How long, Professor?
Five thousand years? That's a hell of a nap. Can't blame you if you've got out of the wrong side of bed. Look, nobody here wants to hurt you.
Please, just. Why don't you tell us your name?
Of course it has a name. And a rank. This is a soldier, and it deserves our respect.
What did you say?
Oh, no.
You idiot! You idiot. Grand Marshal Skaldak.
Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste. Vanquisher of the Phobos Heresy. The greatest hero the proud Martian race has ever produced.
Lock him up.
The Ice Warriors have a different creed, Clara. A different code. By his own standards, Skaldak is a hero. It was said his enemies honoured him so much, they'd carve his name into their own flesh before they died.
There isn't time.
Martian reptile know as the Ice Warrior. When Mars turned cold they had to adapt. They're bio-mechaniod. Cyborgs. Built themselves survival armour so they could exist in the freezing cold of their home world, but a sudden increase in temperature and the armour goes haywire.
Like with the cattle prod thing. Bit of a design flaw. To be honest, I've always wondered why they never sorted it. Oh look, you've got me telling you about them and I said there wasn't time.
This one is.
(sotto) Now? We have to do this now?
(sotto) Seriously? Now? It's the Tardis translation matrix.
DOCTOR (sotto) Yes, they're Russians.
All we needed to do was let Skaldak go and he'd have forgotten us. But you attacked him. You declared war. Harm one of us and you harm us all. That's the ancient Martian code.
You hear that? Skaldak has sent out a distress call. He will bring down the fires of hell just for laying a glove on him.
I'm the only one who can.
What?
Skaldak won't talk to you. You're an enemy soldier.
A soldier knows another soldier. He'll smell it on you. Smell it on you a mile off.
Just let me in there before it's too late. It can't be you or any of your men.
You? No! No! No way. You're not going in there alone, Clara. Absolutely not. No, no. Never.
With your permission?
Ready, Clara?
Okay.
The salute.
Do the salute like I showed you.
Good. Good. Now, like we rehearsed. Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste.
Good. It's okay, Clara. Go closer.
It's not what you deserve.
Hey, it's okay, Clara. Keep going.
Five thousand years.
You are restrained until we can trust each other, Skaldak. You would do exactly the same in my position, and don't even think
About using that sonic weapon. Not in the torpedo room.
No, no, no. Listen, your people live on Skaldak.
Scattered all across the universe. And Mars will rise again, I promise you.
Just let me help you.
Careful, Clara.
No, listen, Clara, don't get too close.
What?
Gone? Gone? Gone? What do you mean, gone?
No, no, no. Skaldak!
Clara, get out of there. Get out!
Now, I've never seen one do this before. Actually, I've never seen one out of its armour before.
No, it will be more dangerous.
Clara? Clara?
Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara!
This wasn't a test, Clara.
You were great, yeah.
Really.
Skaldak got no answer from his Martian brothers. Now he's given up hope.
Being rescued. He thinks he's been abandoned. He's got nothing left to lose.
This sub's stuffed with nuclear missiles, Zhukov. It's fat with them. What do you think Skaldak's going to do when he finds that out? How bad can it be? How bad can it be? It couldn't be any worse.
Okay. Spoke to soon.
It?
I told you, Clara. Earth is like a storm waiting to break, right now. Both sides baring their teeth, talking up war. It would only take one tiny spark.
New. History's in flux. It can be changed. Re-written.
How many of us are left?
We split up and comb this sub. One team stays here to guard the bridge.
Well, it's either that or we stay here and wait for him to kill us.
Shell suit? Clara! For an Ice Warrior to leave its armour is the gravest dishonour. Skaldak is desperate. He is deadly and we have got to find him.
Ah! You saved it.
Ah, Professor, I could kiss you.
Later.
Pressure. Just pressure. We're seven hundred metres down, remember?
No, Professor. Not savage. Forensic. Well, he's dismantled them. Skaldak's learning. Learning all about you. Your strengths, your weaknesses. Come on.
Stay here.
Stay here. Don't argue.
Right. Good.
Oh, Stepashin.
Oh, oh, oh. Fast. He's fast.
Grand Marshal, there is no need for this. Listen to me.
There is something left for you, Skaldak. Mercy.
No, Captain, wait!
Yes, great, fine, good, but we are getting somewhere here. We are negotiating. Jaw-jaw not war-war.
Churchill.
What do you mean?
He summoned the armour.
Sonic tech, Clara. The song of the Ice Warrior.
No!
Skaldak! Skaldak, wait!
No! Skaldak, wait! Wait, wait.
Where is the honour in condemning billions of innocents to death? Five thousand years ago Mars was the centre of a vast empire. The jewel of this solar system. The people of Earth had only just begun to leave their caves. Five thousand years isn't such a long time. They're still just frightened children, still primitive. Who are you to judge them?
Then teach them. Teach them, Grand Marshal. Show them another way. Show them there is honour in mercy. Is this how you want history to remember you? Grand Marshal Skaldak, Destroyer of Earth. Because that's what you'll be if you send those missiles. Not a soldier, a murderer. Five billion lives extinguished. No chance for goodbyes. A world snuffed out like a candle flame! All right. All right, Skaldak, you leave me no choice. I'm a Time Lord, Skaldak. I know a thing or two about sonic technology myself.
No. No, not you, all of us. I will blow this sub up before you can even reach that button, Grand Marshal. Blow us all to oblivion.
In a heartbeat.
Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Look into my eyes and tell me you're capable of doing this. Huh? Can you do that? Dare you do that? Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Come on. Face to face.
We've surfaced. Your people have saved us.
Just go, Skaldak, please. Please, go in peace.
No. No, no, no, no, no. It's still armed. A single pulse from that ship. I'll destroy us if I have to. I will destroy us if I have to. Show mercy, Skaldak. Come on. Show mercy.
Now we're safe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh well, don't worry about that.
Yeah. Well, I wasn't to know, was I?
I've been tinkering, breaking her in. I'm allowed.
(sotto) I reset the HADS.
I reset the HADS.
The HADS. The Hostile Action Displacement System. If the Tardis comes under attack, gunfire, time winds, the sea, it relocates.
Haven't used it in donkey's years. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Well, never mind, it's bound to turn up somewhere.
Ooo. Ha, see? Right on cue. Brilliant.
The Tardis is at the pole.
The south pole.
Could we have a lift?

You'd better stop the Tardis. We don't want any nasty jolts. Prion, did you say?
No, no. Hovering will do.
Tigella? Never heard of it.
Well, we're all in somebody's history books.
Oh, yes.
Why, what screens?
Oh. Oh, those screens. Well, of course I've been to Tigella. Did you say Tigella?
I've been there.
Oo, well, a long time ago. Nice chap called Zastor showed me around. Yes. Remind me to get in touch with him sometime. In fact, I'll do it right now.
First things first?
But not necessarily in that order. Tigella. Zastor.
He'd better not go in the sea in future. He's likely to get into deep water, you know.
Quite. Can you remember where I left his manual?
Why? They're not hostile.
You mustn't believe everything you read in books.
It was reasonably friendly to me. Mind you, it was a long time ago.
Ahem. Post repair test questions. K9, can you hear me?
That's a promising start.
Bit of a nuisance if we have to reprogramme all his constants.
That's not a problem. I happen to be an expert in power sources.
No, no, no. A quick flight, a quick service.
Erm, er, yes. Yes, something like that. They didn't actually let me see it last time. Religious objections.
In a cave. A sort of shrine.
In Tigella. What?
Oh.
Mind you, it's hardly surprising they're in awe of the thing. After all, their whole way of life depends on it.
What's the matter?
Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
Well done, Romana. Well done. You're becoming very accomplished at all this.
(sotto from across the room) K9, what do you know about the Prion planetary system?
So now Tigella's all that's left.
What's the matter?
Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
What's the matter?
Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
That's the third time. What's happening?
Yes. Then what? Repeated time cycles? Oh, no. It couldn't be a chronic hysteresis, could it?
Yes.
It's no good. Every time we try to
What's the matter?
Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
We're still looking.
Yes. No. That's a terrible idea.
There's no known technological procedure. I'm sorry to whisper. There's no known technological procedure. There's no known technological procedure.
What's the matter?
Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
Yes. That's what you said when you were repairing K9. You'd tried everything. Tried everything. We've tried everything. Of course!
Can you remember the rest of what you said?
K9?
Then that's how we'll do it. Throw it out of phase.
Yes, yes, yes, before the cycle comes back again.
What?
Yes, yes, of course. Good. Off you go, then.
What's the matter?
Ah. That's easy. Just waggle his tail.
Well done. You know, for one awful moment I thought you'd forgotten your lines.
Well, according to my calculations, this should be sector eight of the city.
Yes.
This place has grown up a bit since I was last here.
That way.
Right.
Yes? Ah, yes, well, anyone can make a mistake.
Well, I only got the direction wrong because of Tigella's anticlockwise rotation.
Come on, there's no time for botany.
Hello there, I'm the Doctor. I'm expected.
What?
I say, you've got a marvellous memory. It must be fifty of your years since I was last here. Romana? K9, do you know where she is?
Then run and fetch her, and tell her to hurry.
That's odd. I could have sworn Central Control was this way. Ah. Excuse me, I'm the Doctor. I'm expected.
Well, will you just tell people I've arrived?
That's very impressive. It's not exactly what I expected, but it's very impressive.
No, no, it's all right, I'm a doctor.
I don't know. I don't even know where Central Control is. Zastor, how good to see you. Will you tell them who I am?
Please, please, stay calm. I'm sorry I'm late. We could have been here earlier, but for the chronic hysteresis. That's a sort of time loop, you see.
Yes, my assistant. She'll be along in a minute. Anyway Zastor, how are you?
Ah.
But what about Romana?
What, you mean completely disappeared? Evaporated?
Well, as I recall the Dodecahedron, it was much too large to move.
I'm so sorry.
I keep telling you, I don't know. I've only just arrived.
Yes.
In two hour time. (to Lexa) You saw me? You saw me?
I think I see the problem.
No, no, no, no, wait. Wait! Wait. There are three possibilities.
One, the chronic hysteresis. I've never been in one before but it just might have projected a time image of me. It's theoretically possible, isn't it?
Ah.
Well, that makes even less sense.
Well, you see, I just don't do that sort of thing.
I think what we've got here is a good old-fashioned doppelganger.
Well, that's the problem with doppelgangers, you see. You never know who's who.
Right, and let's hope that many hands will make the lights work.
It would have to be solid, assuming some process like baryon multiplication.
Huh, heavy? Assuming an atomic weight of two hundred, not even a dozen Tigellans could have carried it away.
Just how dangerous are the plants?
Ah. In that case I must hurry. I've got a friend on the surface.
No?
I am? Well, I'd be delighted to help in the ordinary way.
Not in the ordinary way.
Won't somebody please say yes?
Yes, but what does this Meglos want?
Zolfa-Thura? Why would he want to do a thing like that?
Right.
Screens? What screens?
Of course. The Screens of Zolfa-Thura.
Thank you, Zastor. Come on, Romana, we're in a hurry.
She's dead.
Yes, but we've got other things to do, other lives to save. Come on.
Right, now, you all stay here.
Exactly. On sight. If Meglos can impersonate me
Right. I won't be long.
Shirt sleeves, eh?
Ah, er, would you say this was vertical?
No. No more than I. Would you just mind holding it up for me while I check from inside? That's it. There we are.
Well, I cut a few corners. I say, I like his coat. Now, what have we got here?
Not yet, not yet.
Programmed?
Oh, well, it is, yes, it is. Nearly. Just a few minor adjustments. I wonder what that's for?
Oh, of course, yes. Of course.
You've served me so well I thought you both deserved a little treat.
That's it.
No, no, Brotadac, no. The Screens don't reach their maximum capacity for two minutes. I'm just going outside for a little stroll to see if I can catch up with myself. And I don't recommend anyone touch those controls.
Oh! Nasty.
That could have been me.
Ooof!
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Yes, they've not been very clever, have they, unlike us.
Well, if my calculations are correct, they certainly won't.
I inverted your control setting. If he starts the countdown, he'll destroy himself, as well as you and me and, well, the whole planet, of course.
Oh, yes. I've often puzzled about that.
Well, why a good looking chap like you should want to control the universe.
Yes. I mean, it baffles me, this burning ambition to. Burning?
Oh, absolutely. Burning?
No, Meglos. Hold him!
Yes.
Yes. He's what you'd call a colourful personality.
Yes, but we're not. Quick, back to the Tardis. Or do you want to be atomised?
Yes.
Good.
You're not going to let us down this time, are you, old girl.
It's time this thing had a thorough overhaul.
Yes, I'd like to stay and help you, but horticulture's not my strong point.
Yes?
What?
Gallifrey? Do they, indeed. Well, we'll see about that when we've dropped our friend off home. Unless, of course, you want to stay here and do some gardening?
Oh?
Well, don't worry about that. We can get you back before you leave.

We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead. Those are tombs. Water tombs. Why would anyone go to so much trouble?


Cybermen in broad daylight? You think people won't notice?
Nice bow tie.









If it's not exploding, what's it doing?


Argh! No. No, no. Stupid. Stupid! No, no. Argh!








Oh, don't do that. You look like you're self-concussing, which would explain all of military history, now I think about it.
Love your outfit, Colonel Ahmed. Are you in the Scouts? Are you a Man Scout? I didn't know they had those.




















Can't play to the gallery unless there's a gallery, and here I am.





The clouds.
There's a Cyberman out there on the fuselage. But on the plus side, it's not turbulence.
She's out. Who let her out?





Who gave you my number?


Clara?
Danny's dead, Clara.
Clara
Clara?


He'll become a Cyberman.




Why did you do that? You didn't have to do that!
Aaah! Aaah!
Argh! Argh!





Pain is a gift. Without the capacity for pain, we can't feel the hurt we inflict.





(sighs)












(to Robin Hood)

I really didn't know. I wasn't sure. You lose sight sometimes. Thank you! I am
And
You didn't notice, did you? While you were doing all your silly orders, while you where showing off, the one soldier not obeying.
Yes, burned up. Totally burnt. Burnt to nothing. Sorry.







Kate.


(sotto) Thank you.


Not bad.













It's a long commute, so, you know, I thought, with you and Danny








Hello.
Why shouldn't I?
Yes, that's true. That is very true.
Ah, you mum's right.
Oh, dear. I'm way past strange. I think I'm probably incredible.
Why would I be lonely?
No.
Good plan.
Your mojo?
Hey, that's good.
My friend. I met her twice before and I lost her both times, and now I don't think I'll ever find her again.
Yeah, everywhere.
It is a bit. Hey, is that your mum?
Yeah, I think you better had.
Well, the first two times I met her, I just sort of bumped into her, so I thought maybe if I just wandered about a bit, I might bump into her again. You know, like destiny, sort of.
Yeah, I think it probably is. Hey, maybe I could find a quiet room and have a good think about it instead.
Goodbye.
So do I.
I'm going to need a horse.
That is not supposed to happen.
Hello?
Sorry?
The internet?
It's twelve oh seven.
Yeah, you really sort of are.
Oh, I dread to think. Listen, where did you get this number?
What woman? Who was she?
Look, listen, I'm not actually, it isn't. You have clicked on the wifi button, yeah?
Click on the wifi, you'll see a list of names. You see one you recognise.
A woman.
What did you say?
Clara. Clara Oswald.
Clara Oswin Oswald.
Do you remember me?
The Doctor. No? The Doctor?
No, just the Doctor. Actually, sorry, could you start all that again?
Could you just ask me that question again?
Okay, just once more.
Ooo, yeah. Ooo. Do you know, I never realised how much I enjoy hearing that said out loud. Thank you.
Hey, no, Clara, please. Clara, I need to talk to you. Listen. Please.
Please, I just need to speak to you.
Oi, you phoned me. You were looking for the internet.
Of course it was me.
I just happened to be in the neighbourhood, on my mobile phone.
Because it's a surprisingly accurate description.
Oi, no, don't.
Right. Don't be a monk. Monks are not cool.
Ah ha! Clara! Clara?
Ah, see? Look, it's me. De-monked. Sensible clothes. Can I come in now?
You just open the door.
Of course you can.
Clara? Clara?
Walking base station. Walking wifi base station. Hoovering up data. Hoovering up people.
Oh no, you don't.
Oh no, you don't.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not this time, Clara, I promise.
Okay. It's okay, it's okay. You're fine. You're back. Yes, you are. Oh yes, you are.
Hello! Are you all right?
Yes.
No.
Oh, quite a lot, actually. Angie called. She's going to stay over at Nina's. Apparently that's all completely fine and you shouldn't worry like you always do. For god's sake get off her back. Also, your dad phoned, mainly about the government. He seems very cross with them, I've got several pages on that. I said I'd look into it. I fixed that rattling noise in the washing machine, indexed the kitchen cupboards, optimised photosynthesis in the main flower bed and assembled a quadricycle.
I found a disassembled quadricycle in the garage.
I invented the quadricycle. Ha!
Don't you remember?
Do you know now?
Well then, you should go to sleep. Because you're safe now, I promise. Goodnight, Clara.
Well, yes. Yes, I am.
I promise I won't budge from this spot.
Eh?
I like your house.
But you look after the kids. Oh yes, you're a governess, aren't you, just like
Just like. I thought you probably would be.
There's something in the wifi.
This whole world is swimming in wifi. We're living in a wifi soup. Suppose something got inside it. Suppose there was something living in the wifi, harvesting human minds. Extracting them. Imagine that. Human souls trapped like flies in the world-wide web. Stuck forever, crying out for help.
A computer can hack another computer. A living, sentient computer, maybe that could hack people. Edit them. Re-write them.
Because a few hours ago you knew nothing about the internet, and you just made a joke about Twitter.
You were uploaded for a while. Wherever you were, you brought something extra back, which I very much doubt you'll be allowed to keep.
You and me inside that box, now.
Look, just get inside.
Oh, trust me. You'll understand once we're in there.
Clara. A what?
Clara, look around you.
No, people are switching on the lights. The wifi is switching on the people.
A walking base station. You saw one earlier.
It must have taken an image from your subconscious, thrown it back at you. Ah! Active camouflage. They could be everywhere.
Some planes have wifi.
We must be one hell of a target right now.
You, me, box, right now.
Yes, it's a spaceship. Yes, it's bigger on the inside. Now, I don't have time to talk about it.
Shut up, please. Short hops are difficult.
Right, come on.
We've moved. It's a spaceship. We flew away.
Not exactly.
It's a ship. I told you. It's all very sciency.
Asleep. Switched off by the wifi. Never mind them.
I'm the Doctor. I'm an alien from outer space. I'm a thousand years old, I've got two hearts and I can't fly a plane! Can you?
Oh, fine. Let's do it together.
Whoo! Would a victory roll be too showy offy?
Well, I'm blocking your wifi so you're waking up, for a start. Tell you what, do you want to drive?
Breakfast.
It's a time machine. You never have to wait for breakfast.
Thank you, thank you. Yes, magic blue box.
All donations gratefully accepted. Roll up, give us your dosh. Pennies, pounds, anything you've got.
Keep collecting. We need enough for breakfast. Just popping back to the garage.
This way.
No, it came at the usual time. We just took a short cut. Thank you, thank you. Tomorrow, a camel.
I don't take the Tardis into battle.
Because it's the most powerful ship in the universe and I don't want it falling into the wrong hands. Okay?
Whoever's after us spent the whole night looking for us. Are you tired?
What? Then imagine how they feel. They came the long way round. They've got to be close. Definitely London going by the signal distribution. I can hack the lowest level of their operating system but I can't establish a physical location. The security's too good.
I am. Yes, okay with that?
Oh, good.
I don't know. I can't tell the future, I just work there.
Oh, you know what I always say about plans.
I don't have one.
Yes. Yes, I suppose they do. So tell me, how long have you been looking after those kids?
Okay. Why you? Family friend, I get that, but there must have been others. Why did it have to be you? You don't really seem like a nanny.
Sorry. What?
Yes.
Oi, hang on. I need that.
If I can't find them, you definitely can't.
So do I.
I'm from space and the future with two hearts and twenty seven brains.
Okay, slight exaggeration.
The security is absolute.
Sorry, no, it's nothing. It's just, you're a nanny. Isn't that a bit, well, Victorian?
You're young. Shouldn't you be doing, you know, young things, with young people?
No. No. I didn't. Shut up.
Two more cappuccinos over there, please.
I'm sorry, what?
Er, yes. Yes. Fine.
You okay?
Learning fast.
I saw what you can do last night.
So there's one of your walking base stations here, somewhere close.
I don't know who you are or why you're doing this, but the people of this world will not be harmed. They will not controlled. They will not be
It's obscene. It's murder.
This ends. I'm going to end this today.
Who's doing this? Who is your client? Hmm? Answer me.
You found them.
Floor sixty five.
I'm listening to you. You found them.
Clara? Clara?
I rode this in the antigrav Olympics, 2074. I came last.
Did you even hear the word, antigrav?
Download her.
Download her back into her body right now.
Yes, you can.
Then download the entire cloud. Everyone you've trapped in there.
Yes, those with bodies to go home to would be free.
They'd be released from a living hell. It's the best you can do for them, so give the order.
Because I'm going to motivate you, any second now.
I didn't.
I'm still in the cafe.
I'm finishing my coffee. Lovely spot.
I'm old-fashioned.
Here's your motivation.
Come in.
You didn't answer my question.
You don't seem like a nanny.
She died, so you're returning the favour. You've got a hundred and one places to see, and you haven't been to any of them, have you? That's why you keep the book.
But you don't run out on the people you care about. Wish I was more like that. You know, the thing about a time machine, you can run away all you like and still be home in time for tea, so what do you say? Anywhere. All of time and space, right outside those doors.
Eh?
It is not a snog box.
Starting when?
Why?
It's a time machine. Any time's okay.
Clara? In your book there was a leaf. Why?
Right then, Clara Oswald. Time to find out who you are.

Hmm.
Bit of a mish-mash.
Well, one of the ships must have been in dematerialised form when it happened. Nasty. Could cause terrible problems.
Yes. Interfaces, I should say.
Interfere? Of course we should interfere. Always do what you're best at, that's what I say. Now, come on.
I don't know.
At our own pace.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. I'd say it was knock for knock, wouldn't you?
No, no. We answered your mayday. I'm from Galactic Insurance and Salvage. Been having a look around. This is my assistant, Romana. I'm the Doctor. How do you do?
Oh, K9? Well, a computer of sorts.
No. But he has been know to bite. Aren't we going to introduce ourselves?
We just met.
How do you do.
Yes.
What about a better idea? Why don't we try to separate the ships?
I like doing the impossible.
Oh, you've spoilt it now.
Therefore if we can recreate identical circumstances the ships could be separated.
Then full reverse.
I preferred it when it seemed impossible.
Are you pressing the right button?
Can we switch on the wreck of the power unit?
All right, all right. Where's the power unit?
Good. No, Romana, you stay here. I might need you. I'll take K9. K9? K9?
Hold on, I thought the idea was you'd show me.
How very odd.
Any idea what this is, K9?
Yes?
Vraxoin? I've seen whole communities, whole planets destroyed by this. It induces a kind of warm complacency and a total apathy. Until it wears off, that is, and soon you're dead. Come on.
Yes.
Yes. I'll tell you something about your man Secker.
He ran away.
Yes. Perhaps he's unwell. Can I have a look at your log and check to see if he's been to any planet where he might have picked up Vraxoin?
What about one of the passengers? One of them could have been the carrier, so to speak.
Anyone else?
Tryst?
Where had he been?
Yes, but I'd still like to know where he's been.
Me?
Well, I told you. I'm from Galactic.
I wondered why I hadn't been paid.
That's what I thought. Where can I find Tryst?
Good, good. Look, you try and find Secker and meet me in the first class lounge and
No, no. Do you want this ship repaired or not?
Well then, just find Secker and meet me in the lounge in five minutes.
Bye.
Really? Then where did you go?
What?
I do.
No, no, no, that's perfectly all right. I'm just interested in the voyage. It's fascinating.
The Volante.
And you invented this marvellous machine to collect your specimens? You know, I knew a man once who toyed with an idea like this. What was his name? Professor Stein?
Yes.
Yes, well, by reputation. He once gave a seminar on the
Of course. You're extremely anxious to be on your way.
No.
Could you take me to the power unit yourself?
Good, good. Tryst, thank you very much for your story. Very interesting. We must have a chat about this machine of yours sometime.
And about the notion of your capturing alien species for your own private zoo.
Yes.
By putting them in this machine?
Ah, yes, of course. Just in the same way a jam maker conserves raspberries.
No. K9 checked all the planets he'd been to.
None of them could explain Secker's condition.
Absolutely sure.
Fascinating. The two ships are rejecting each other. Molecularly speaking, that is.
Exactly. Exactly. Is there another way to the power unit?
That won't be necessary. I've got my own equipment.
Where's the power unit?
I don't know.
K9, see if you can find anything in there.
Just go near the edge.
Hello. No wait, please.
I. Bushwhacked!
Bushwhacked!
Gone.
Yes. Someone aboard this ship is smuggling drugs. Vraxoin.
Yes.
Yes.
That's right. They incinerated an entire planet. Someone's found another source.
What, the lift?
What about it?
Oh no, the animals themselves are converted into magnetic signals, and their habitats.
Yes. The CET machine's just an electric zoo. For cages, read laser crystals. Either way, the animals are trapped inside.
What do you mean?
What?
That's a pity. He might have been able to say what attacked him.
Right, first things first. Romana, you take care of the CET machine.
Separate the ships. Come on, Rigg.
Well, Captain, you'll have to show us the best place.
Oh, I'm sure K9 will be careful, won't you, K9?
Go. Make it as big as you can, K9.
He's not just a mobile blowtorch, you know. He's saved my life on lots of occasions. Beat me at chess, once. Shush.
I don't know.
Nothing's inexplicable.
It's inexplicable. We'd better put it back.
Maybe, but Secker was a dead man already.
He was taking Vraxoin.
Dymond's ship?
Yes, the Vraxoin must be found.
Bad stuff? It's the worst. I've seen whole planets ravaged by it while the merchants made fortunes.
What, my people?
No! I'm the Doctor. I keep telling you that.
Work for? I don't work for anybody. I'm just having fun.
Can you check the whole ship with this?
Secker kept his in the luggage area. I took what was left then someone took it from me. After stunning me, that is.
Yes, who indeed.
Is there any possible shield against that scan?
Really?
Yes, a small thick tube. Very mysterious.
Yes, I know, I know. We've got to get the ships separated.
Yes. You know, there might be a way we can do it using my ship.
Yes.
Oh, around.
Yes. Or I you, Captain.
Yes, but who's helping whom?
Right, when I give the word, I want Dymond to put his ship on full power. Trust me, Captain.
I want to get as close as possible.
Tell me, K9, how is it that, how is it you always look on the black side of things?
Here am I, trying a little lateral thinking, and what do you do? You trample all over it with logic.
Sixty percent. I heard you, I heard you. But it's worth a try. Now, come on. Let's go and find your mistress. Come on. Come on.
Are you sure about that? That creature came through the picture?
You were right about this machine. It is unstable, and that creature's escaped from its electric zoo. I wonder where it came from?
Eden?
Well, it rings a bell.
I'm absolutely amazed.
No, I mean I'm amazed at you, Tryst, using a machine like this when it's still so primitive. The whole thing's utterly unstable.
Good, good. I value my life and this machine makes me fear for it.
Yes.
Well, at a rough guess I'd say the spatial integrator, transmutation oscillator, hologistic retention circuit. Shall I go on?
Dimensional osmosis damper?
You mean you haven't even got a dimensional osmosis damper? Professor, you don't realise how unstable this machine is.
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.
Good!
What?
I'm on my way. Romana, off to the Tardis. I'll give you details later. Tryst! Don't you forget to switch that off.
Stay there, K9. Stay there. Right then, Dymond. Ready for another try? I want you to put your ship on full power. Not now. When I tell you.
Here, if it's all right with you. Romana's in my ship. I can keep an eye on things from here.
Thank you. Romana?
Good, good. We're just waiting on Dymond. K9?
Just in case your prediction is correct, go along to one of the blurred areas and take a reading for me.
Good dog.
Good. Start building up power.
Romana, get ready. What did you say? Romana, get ready.
No, no. Come on, Dymond, now. Don't lose your nerve. We're almost there. Just a bit longer.
Romana, switch off. Something's wrong. I'll go and find K9. He's taking a reading for me.
K9? K9, where are you? K9? He must have slipped through. Good boy, K9!
Ah, could I have a word with you, please?
I'm looking for a man dressed just like you.
Which way did he go? This way?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I promise you, everything possible is being done.
Here, have a jelly baby and don't forget to brush your teeth.
I only wanted a word with you, whoever you are. You took something from me, old chap. I'd rather like to have it back.
I just want to talk to you. I promise you, you'll enjoy it. Stop!
What are you doing?
Romana, stop. Do you know I've just come through an interface? That's no mean feat. I'm not even sure I'm all here.
Yes, I have, I have. Did you see anyone while I was in there? Coveralls, dark glasses.
It must have been the chap I was chasing. The fellow who jumped me in the luggage section. Still, I know something about him now. He dropped his radiation band in the struggle just now. Look. Volante.
Yes.
Rigg said Tryst and Della were the only ones from the expedition to come aboard.
Well, we have to ask Rigg.
What?
Well, that doesn't sound like drunkenness to me.
Well, inside the projection set. It's the only place. Romana, we've got no choice.
What we have to do. We've got to get inside that machine. Come on.
Oh, really.
You can?
Romana, please.
You are?
Yes.
What!
Well, maybe it's because she's innocent. How'd you know she did it?
Thank you, Tryst.
Did you hear that?
Good, good. Now listen.
Can I just tell you something, please?
On this ship
Neither have I.
Drugs. Vraxoin.
Will you please listen? Someone aboard this ship is smuggling drugs.
Well how would I know? I don't even know who he is yet.
Oh, well, I'm called the Doctor. Date of birth difficult to remember. Sometime quite soon, I think.
Would you please listen? Vraxoin is the biggest killer drug in existence and it's on this ship!
There's no good time. The criminals must be caught.
You're wasting your time.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Fisk
All right. Can I just say one thing at this moment?
It's simply that. Look!
We've only got a few seconds.
Quick, Romana. CET machine, quickly.
Get me Eden.
Test an old theory of mine. Come on.
Come on, Romana. We must, we must.
We've got no alternative. Come on. Come on.
Well, how do you like Eden?
Might give us a few answer, though.
Let's go east.
Well, I don't. We'll go that way and we'll call it east.
All right, we'll call it north.
(sotto) Can we go, please?
The same way I knew we could get into the Tardis. Tryst doesn't realise what he's stumbled on. At least, I don't think he has.
Yes. All this is recorded on laser crystal. When it's played back
Yes, well, roughly speaking.
Yes.
Yes.
Idiots? They're worse than idiots, they're bureaucrats. They just exist to tangle people up, wrap them round and round in red tape until they can't move. Romana?
I can't move.
Don't wriggle, don't wriggle. It'll realise it's got dinner.
Yes. It eats people.
Quick, over there. The root.
Root, root!
Yes.
You know, that didn't taste at all bad.
Shush. It's waiting for us to make any kind of sound.
(sotto) It's gone. Now take care.
I don't know. Hello there, thank you very much. We're terribly grateful to you for saving our lives.
Stott! Stott of the Tryst expedition?
Yours, I believe. I'm the Doctor, this is Romana. We're travellers and
Come on, this way.
Not bad, not bad at all. How long have you been here?
Well, Stott, you've got some explaining to do. A hundred and eighty three days here?
Yes, yes, quite. Tell me, when did you first discover you could get out of the projection?
Really?
Why didn't you tell Tryst and Della you'd got out?
Really?
Ah ha. You thought it was me, didn't you.
Yeah. You've got the stuff I had?
Yes, but more important is where the main supply is hidden and where it comes from.
Then we've got to get the dimension projection sealed off again, which means doing what we first came to do.
Separate the ships. Tell me, if we go out of the projection in that direction, do we come to the power unit?
Good, good. Then that's what we'll do. Come on. Well, come on.
It's all right, he's mine.
It's just a perfectly ordinary electric dog.
Good, good. Now listen, K9. This is Stott. He's a friend. All right?
Good. Let's get to work. (Stott and K9 stand guard.)
Liquid hydrogen, turbopump exhaust, reactor core, pressure shell. Right.
Of course I do. I can start anything from a steam engine to a Tardis. Have you got a match?
I want to jam this switch down.
Perfect.
You'd better guard the door, K9. How many were there?
Five! I'd better get a move on or they'll be all over the ship.
No, no, no. Until the ships are separated and the projection is stabilised, it'd be like trying to bail out a small boat with a
Yes.
Is that the one, Romana? Romana, was that
K9!
K9, quickly!
I've got to get this finished. Romana, did you check the cable to the reactor?
Well, check it. I need to be absolutely sure.
It's perfectly all right. It's quite dead.
Was it the one?
It's a good thing you checked. I could have caused a spectacular explosion.
Nearly. Two things. One, I need to know whether the power on the bridge is on maximum. Two, the demat has to be switched on from the Tardis at exactly the same time I switch on this old gas oven. All right?
Good.
Stott, I want you and Romana to go back through the jungle. K9, I want you to go back the way you came.
Will you listen to me, please? Stott and I came through one. It's perfectly all right if it's on the edge of a hull. All you need is a little determination.
Good. Now, when you get through, I want you to go back to the demat machine set up near the Tardis, and when I whistle, you switch it on. Right?
Good.
No, no. I'm going to rig myself a little time device. Could I borrow your watch, please?
Good. Is that on ship's time? Right. Now, I'll give you till 20:25 to reach the bridge and put the power on. I'll set my device so I can escape in good time.
I'll have to use my wits. Off you go. Take care. Look out for excisemen. I don't think they like us very much. Off you go then.
Twenty oh one.
Plenty of time.
No! No!
Vraxoin. Of course! So that's it.
Twenty twenty-one? I'll never do it.
How very odd. How very strange.
How very clever.
The profits on human suffering.
Hello, K9.
Hello, Romana. Everything all right?
I got caught in the interface when the two ships separated. Hello, Della.
Look out! Quick!
Bit uncivil of them, pointing their guns at us like that.
Yes. Tell me, what would you use an inchuka laser for?
Shush. Could it carry a CET projection crystal?
Because Dymond's got a CET projection machine aboard the Hecate with an inchuka laser attached.
It looks like it. The only way of convincing Fisk is to catch them in the act of transferring the Vraxoin.
Stott, leave it to K9!
Never mind about us. We know who the smugglers are.
Dymond's the pick-up man, and the smuggler's Tryst himself.
Yes. The Vraxoin's kept on the Eden crystal. They're about to transfer that crystal to the Hecate.
Yes. One of them attacked me in the Power unit. Poor thing was electrocuted, burnt to a powder.
Vraxoin.
Yes. They can make the transference across space by means of the inchuka laser.
Yes.
I let them do it.
You're arresting the wrong man, you know, Fisk.
Romana, what happened?
The callous wretches. They'll be making the transfer to the Hecate by now.
Gentlemen, once more into the
What happened?
They won't go anywhere without the Eden crystal. That gives us a little time.
Well, now that the ships are separated, we can at last stabilise the CET properly.
Yes.
It means, Fisk, that we can finally clear this marauding menagerie back into the projection, which is exactly where Dymond will want it.
Give him what he wants. We have to bait the hook properly, don't we?
I'm going inside now and I may be rather a long time.
Ah. Oh gosh, oh lord, oh Doctor.
Steady, steady. This way. Not that way! This. Oh! Oh!
Oh, my fingers, my arms, my legs! Ah! My everything! Argh!
Quick, switch it off!
Phew. Well done, Romana.
Romana, you've got two minutes fifty eight seconds to rebuild this machine.
Yes.
Yes!
Do I look as if I'm joking? Well?
Increase the gain on the matrix modulator. Well?
Five points. That's not enough. We're going to need some more power from somewhere.
Good.
Good dog, K9. Come on, put your leads on. Put your leads on. There.
I want to increase the range and power of this machine. How many points now, Romana?
Ten and building. That's much better. We're going to be all right.
Yes, yes. It was just a little shock, that's all.
Shush! Quiet, quiet. Reverse the setting on the transmutation reflex. It's all right, it's all right, it's quite safe.
So?
Will you please reverse the setting on the transmutation reflex!
K9?
I want you to find the Hecate. Give me her position.
Good dog.
Forty seven point three vector seven niner niner. I hope you're right, K9.
Well, good.
Have you ever heard the expression, hoist by his own petard?
Good, well what
On the contrary, Fisk. I've already caught them. There they are, all yours.
All I did was increase the range of this machine and brought them back. Matter transmutation, you see. And because the projection's still unstable, all you have to do is pluck them out.
Go away.
Go away.
Well, how are you now, Della? Good? Good?
The nightmare's here, on the Eden crystal.
I think the best way of conserving the poor creatures trapped in these crystals is to project them back to their own planets, don't you?
The mandrels have a perfect right to exist. In one way Tryst was right. Humans do have some kind of choice. Let's just hope that no one else discovers the secret.

It's not clear. It's not clear at all. What has gone wrong?
Take a look for yourselves.
Well, it looks like moving water to me. It might be a river somewhere. I don't know. What's the reading, Susan?
Well, I don't want to boast, but we might be somewhere in London, hmm?
Well, there we are. Back home. Your planet.
More by good luck than judgment. What a horrible mess.
It's uncanny. Wonder which era we've landed in?
Oh, I'm just wondering about the time factor, my boy.
Well I hope for both your sakes we're near your time, but bear in mind we might have landed in the early 1900s or the 25th century.
Yes, that's the word I was looking for, decay. It's most odd, most odd.
Well, you take this bridge, now. It isn't an easy task, is it? Look at all this neglect all over the place. It's been abandoned, all of it.
Perhaps, perhaps.
Oh my dear, now believe you me, I wouldn't spoil your homecoming for all the world.
Be careful, my child.
Yes, you're always dashing about, aren't you. You're far too curious.
The ship, Chesterton. The ship! Don't go to near, my boy, its not safe.
Yes, well, it's all crumbling.
Yes, it's going to be very difficult, but remember we're in London.
Well, the people, they'll all be curious. They'll want to know why we're trying to break into a police box.
Yes, exactly.
Oh, my dear boy, you can't just whisk up men and material out of the thin air now, can you, hmm?
You know, my dear boy, I never fail to be impressed by your optimism. You can't move that by sheer brute force. You were right, you need a cutting flame.
It's intelligent. That's good. But you know, young man, I have a feeling, or call it intuition if you like. I don't believe we're anywhere near your time, the 1960's.
Yes, well, ask yourself. Here we are, standing by the Thames and we've been here quite a while, how long? Quarter of an hour, twenty minute?
Well, what have we heard? Nothing. Precisely nothing. No sound of birdsong, no voices, no sound of shipping, and not even the chimes of old Big Ben. It's uncanny. Uncanny.
Oh, so you're sitting up and taking notice again, are you?
No, no harm done, child. No harm done, no. Do you realise we can't get into the ship? What's all this rubble then? Look at it.
We shall be as quick as we can. And you bathe that ankle. What you need is a jolly good smacked bottom! Come on.
Let's take a snoop.
I'm not a half-wit.
Chesterton, come here.
What a musty smell. This place hasn't been used in years.
What's that monstrosity out there?
What's happened to London, dear boy, is more to the point.
What's this, then?
Ah, here, look. At least we know the century, dear boy. Look.
There's so much rubbish. It's a jungle here.
It looks like some sort of adornment, but what for?
No, I think there's something more to it than that. You know, I think that this is an extra ear, ideal for picking up high-frequency radio waves.
Yes, something like that.
Well, whatever it is, I wouldn't like to meet one of these fellows, you know.
He was murdered!
Right, dear boy, come on.
Except you. I think we'd better pause in this search and get back to the others. Come along.
It might have been something to do with that gunfire we heard across the river.
Well, let's wait and see, hmm?
Yes, but aren't you even a bit curious? After all, it's your city, you know. Don't you want to know what's happened to it?
Hmm?
Evening. Look how filthy that water is.
Hmm? What?
Huh, stupid.
Well, I repeat, it's stupid. A stupid place to put a poster. Right under a bridge where nobody can read it or see it.
A dead human body in the river? I should say that's near murder, isn't it, hmm?
Hmm?
It's got me worried, very worried.
Yes, now, never mind about that flying saucer, my boy. That suggestion of yours about the plague. Supposing one of them's been in that water. They're bound to be contaminated with some sort of bacteria!
No, the smell of it's enough. Anyway, let us go further afield. Come along, come along. Now I suggest that you go up that way then I go
We can go back down there, hmm?
What else?
Leave this to me, dear boy. I think you'd better let us go.
Not for long.
Die? And just who are you to condemn us to death? (sotto) I think we'd better pit our wits against them and defeat them.
Resistance is useless? Surely you don't expect all the people to welcome you with open arms?
Conquered the Earth? You poor, pathetic creatures. Don't you realise? Before you attempt to conquer the Earth, you will have to destroy all living matter.
My dear boy, what in Skaro was a million years ahead of us in the future. What we're seeing now is about the middle history of the Daleks.
Look, they've taken some more prisoners. What is so different about the Daleks? Oh, I see. You mean the discs on their backs.
Yes, yes, quite so. But remember, this is an invasion force, therefore they have to adapt themselves to the planet.
Yes, the work of a genius, dear boy.
Only on the surface, my friends.
I had a good look into that corridor. Did you notice the television eyes round about?
No.
Yes. Nevertheless, it has possibilities.
My young friend, don't be so pessimistic. What is your name, by the way?
Well, Mister Jack Craddock, don't be such a defeatist. Our job is to try and get out of here, and quickly.
Yes, quite so.
Yes, that explains your poster, dear boy. Germ bombs, hmm?
Suppose we forget all this blab about Bedfordshire. Have either of you seen this?
What is that you've got there?
Hmm. Let me have that bar up there for a moment, will you?
I should say it was more advanced than that. Well now, let's try a little experiment.
You see? It responds. Magnetised.
Now that's a very good question, dear boy. Suppose you were a Dalek and you found yourself locked up in this room. How would you get out?
My dear young man, the Daleks have only feelers, no hands, and they use their brains, not brute force.
Now that's the very word. A key in a crystal box. You open the box, take out the key and use it. That is precisely what the Dalek would do.
Look at that little light up there.
Quite. Let me have that thing, will you?
Yes, that. Thank you.
Now, we have to make sure that we hit the correct refractive, otherwise we shall get showered with crystal glass.
My dear boy, if they had to deal with a man of your talents, they need hardly fear, need they. Now do sit down and rest, please. Oh, dear, now where were we? Ah, yes, of course, yes, yes, yes. Now, X equals gamma, that means roughly two and a half percent, so that should give us a curve of around about eighty degrees. Oh by the way, did you take three dimensional graph geometry at your school, hmm?
What a pity. What a pity. We shall have to boil this down now, shan't we. Well, now then, let's see. We'll start third from the left and then I'll follow it from the right and straight over. All right? Now put that bar there, and watch your eyes because you know, it might be nasty. Are you ready?
Hold that and shut up, will you. Pay attention. Let me have the bar, please.
Only sometimes, dear boy? What's happened to your memory? Don't you remember we know that the Daleks can use static electricity?
Yes, and we happened to outwit them, too. Please go away, will you? Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. Now, all we have to do is to slide this bar back here, and the self-same bar slides back into place here through electricity.
Precisely. Now I want you to give him a hand in a minute. Just turn that pole under there, will you. There, you see?
Yes, precisely. Now we've created a force field. Right, now turn the pole round. Give him a hand, quickly. Come on.
Come on.
Yes, there are very few of us left. Now, let's get out, and be crafty.
Let go of me! Take your hands off me!
No, no, please, what are you doing? No. Let me go now. Let me go!
Susan.
Goodbye, my friend. Goodbye.
This is a time I should have my stick.
Oh, I think that's quite enough to start with. You know, I never realised that walking was so difficult, so exhausting.
Yes, I think it is.
In quite a while, I might be able to travel.
I don't care what that young man says. I make the decisions here, my dear, and I think we should make our way back to the Tardis.
Do you question my authority, child?
You seem to place more reliance on that young man's word than mine, don't you.
Ah. Hmm. Me?
Yes, well, er, yes, yes, of course, young man. Yes, well, I suggest that as soon as I'm able to walk again, we should travel north. Then we might be able to join up with the resistance party. Mark you, it's only a suggestion. I really should leave it to you, you know. Think it out for yourself.
What?
Yes, I think it's a very good idea.
I think we should get on our way.
Shh.
Oh, dear. Ghastly. Well I must say this is a nice state of affairs. Weve barely covered a mile and here we are hiding down the sewers again.
You do realise, of course, we shall have to let them both come down before we decide to defend ourselves.
Oh yes, just one. The others bound to return and bring back reinforcements.
Well, is everybody alright?
No, Tyler, no. I never take life. Only when my own is immediately threatened. Now then, let us make our way to this mine and then we shall know how to deal with these Daleks. Leave this creature to his own devices and salvation. Come along. You lead the way, my boy. Come along.
Smells familiar round here.
Ah, yes, my dear.
Quite, quite. I can see somethings cooking.
Most useful.
Susans a very good cook.
Hmm?
Well its quite obvious to me its the centre of their operations.
Yes, quite. You know, you surprise me, Tyler. Why didnt you concentrate your efforts here?
No, I think perhaps it might be the answer to the question as to why the Daleks are here.
Oh no, it goes much deeper than that. You see, man, to them, is just a work machine. An insignificant specimen that is not worth invading. Absolutely useless. It doesnt matter to them whether you live or die.
Well, at the moment, my boy, Im not quite sure, but let us say something that this planet contains. Something that no planet has.
Yes, quite, quite. Instead, there they are, burrowing like moles down and through the crust of the Earth.
Not unless they know how to control the flow of living energy, hmm?
Yes, they dare. And we have got to dare to stop them.
Hmm?
I certainly have not. Ah, good! There seems to be a way down there.
Yes, well lets have a closer look.
How many bombs have you got left?
Yes, well that should be enough. Now, you see that mast over there?
And the cable behind it?
Well, I want you and Susan to walk around the lip of the crater and sever it. Use the bombs. Detonate with your revolver, right?
Off you go, and dont stop to pick daises on the way.
I dont think theyll run into any trouble.
Thatll be harder to guarantee. Come along. Get down.
Now, Ive neutralised the warning system.
Shall we go in?
Thank you, but dont call me Doc, I prefer Doctor. Do you mind?
Apparently things are on the move.
My dear Barbara!
The magnet! The magnet, quickly!
Is Chesterton with you? Never mind.
We must begin our action before the Daleks get back.
But why?
Well, we must prevent this, Barbara. If they succeed, it will the mean that they'll upset the entire constellation. Weve got to prevent it!
By keeping the Daleks here. Keep your eyes skinned on the door.
Now, I wonder. Can I do anything with this scanner?
Oh yes! Susan and David. Now, theyre trying to fracture the outer cable ring.
Well, if its possible, you see, we might be able to immobilise the Daleks.
The radio circuits still working.
Theres nothing we can do, my dear. Just watch and wait. We cant contact them from here.
A chance? Yes.
Not now, Barbara. We dont know how long this little trick of ours will hold the Daleks. We may have to find something else.
Yes! Thats brilliant, my dear! Good. Carry on.
Turn on the Daleks, turn on the Daleks, kill the Daleks, do you hear?
My dear boy, where did you spring from?
Well, the people are fighting back at last!
I dont think their device will succeed in that position. But still, it will be a gigantic explosion.
Yes, I quite agree.
And we must all meet back on the cliff, we were before. Now hurry up, all of you.
The explosion will take place any second. Keep right down, all of you!
The saucers were caught in the upward thrust of that explosion.
In that, my dear? Impossible. Theres something new for you, Tyler. A volcanic eruption in England.
Yes, its unbelievable.
Yes, and its to them that you must dedicate your next task, the rebuilding of the Earth. And Im sure youre going to make a great success of it.
Just the beginning. Just the beginning. All alone, eh, Susan, hmm?
Yes, I afraid weve had so little time for that sort of thing lately.
I, er, well, Im sorry, Susan.
Oh my dear Susan, youre hurt.
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
Dear, dear, dear, I shall have to mend this, shant I now?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no worry, my child, no. When Ive finished with this, it will look as good as new.
Yes. Hmm.
Yes, you little monkey. You know, since youve been away from that school, you seem to have got yourself thoroughly disorganised, havent you? Yes, you need taking in hand. Well, I, er, I think I must check up on the ship, if you dont mind.
Listen, Susan, please. Ive double-locked the doors. You cant get in. Now move back, child, where I can see you.
During all the years, Ive been taking care of you, you in return have been taking care of me.
Not any longer, Susan. Youre still my grandchild and always will be, but now, youre a woman too.
I want you to belong somewhere, to have roots of your own. With David, youll be able to find those roots and live normally like any woman should do.
Believe me, my dear, your future lies with David, and not with a silly old buffer like me. One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs, and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine. Goodbye, Susan, goodbye, my dear.

It very nearly ate you for dinner.
It wasn't going to eat me.
The second most beautiful garden in all of time and space, and we can  never come back here because you, Miss Oswald, decided
Who said you could give out my number?
Did you make this human?
She's better than that. She's brilliant. What are you doing running round getting tattoos when there's
Okay, show me this tattoo that you didn't get, then.
It's a tattoo. It's very boring.
Oh, that's not boring. That is very not boring.
Okay, Local Knowledge, you're coming with us. Bring the new  human. No, don't bring the new human. I'll just get distracted.
If you want your extremities to stay attached, stand absolutely still.  If not, we can provide a small bag, you can take them home at the end.
Oh. Right, okay, here we go. Ah Good. Weird. Good and weird.
Er, oh, yes, yes. Of course. First off. In the last twenty four hours,  you have had significant contact with alien lifeforms, right here in the  centre of London.
You've been retconned.
Amnesia drug.
Your pre-frontal cortex is marinating in it. Ooo, there's something else. Something. Er, not good. Weird.
There is no nice way to say you're about to die.
Rigsy
Okay. Okay. Yes, okay, let's do this thing. First up, stop the  countdown. Five hundred and twenty six minutes. Right. Okay. Yes, you  know what, Local Knowledge, I don't know who did this to you or why. But  I do almost certainly know   how to find them.
There have always been rumours, stories passed from traveller to traveller. Mutterings about hidden streets.
Secret pockets of alien life right here on Earth. Like a  smuggler's cove, only not a cove, because it's right here, right in the  middle of the capital.
No. The maps are.
I never put stock in it. London streets that suddenly  disappeared from human view? No. You lot are always overlooking things,  but whole streets? That would be excessive, even for you. If the stories are true, though, there should be a street on one of  these old maps that no longer exists in the real world.
What did you say?
My God. A whole London street just up and disappeared and you lot assume it's a copyright infringement.
We're looking for a trap street and we're not going to find it here.
The glasses are tracking your eye movements. Just keep looking straight down and
Whatever they're using, it only hides the street itself. It prevents you from noticing there's even something missing. They're somehow making our eyes skate right over it. Let's call it a misdirection circuit.
Tell me about it. It's an ongoing problem. Here.
Keep it steady. Just  move it slowly over the grid. When we're done, we'll have a map of the areas of the grid that Clara couldn't focus on.
Okay, we  split up. Clara, that way. (she walks off) Local Knowledge. (another  direction) Forget the way you usually look at the world. This  street's going to be hiding in plain sight.
If you see something unusual or notable, dismiss it. Just keep walking. But if there's a bit of London so unremarkable that you don't even think about it stop. You could very well be standing right outside a trap street. Count everything that you see.
Because when you hit the area around a trap street, it's very likely you'll lose count.
Seventy nine, eighty, eighty one, eighty two.
Remember. Eighty two.
You'll lose count because the misdirection circuit is creating confusion in your mind. Details won't add up. Reality will have glitches in it.
Like when you try to read the same simple sentence three times over
And the meaning just won't sink in.
Clara! Clara! Clara!
We're very close. We need to distract our other senses. Clara,  go back to the Tardis. Pick up all my most annoying stuff.
What happened to the stuff I asked you to bring?
What is it? What are you remembering?
Fifty minutes left. Hoodie up, Local Knowledge. They know what you look like in there.
You were upset, weren't you? Something slipped through the retconned  memory. Something that took over your whole mind. Something juicy. So the misdirection circuit lost its power over you.
Well, perhaps they do
Asylum?
Yeah, of course.
That's your name. I keep telling you that.
It's professional interest.
Still saving the world from me, then?
I saw you.
Yes, you did, and you have. Now we need your help. Someone in this place is in control of a Quantum Shade.
You.
What have you done?
You flooded his brain with retcon! Till we showed up, he didn't even know that he had to say goodbye.
Ashildr, given we're all going to forget this conversation anyway, perhaps you could tell us what happened here yesterday to necessitate a death sentence?
No. You've already endangered one of my friends. I want your personal guarantee that you will not endanger another.
So you're still calling yourself Me, then?
Mayor Me.
Difficult, isn't it?
How long have you been here?
The battle?
This misdirection circuit of yours is remarkable. The cloaking device that hides the street,  makes everyone look like humans.
Aiee ah!
Yes, a phrase I find is usually followed by a lot of screaming and running and bleeding.
She's a Janus.
The child. A daughter?
No, it's not bad, it's just unhelpful. A daughter might've seen who killed her mother.
The female Janus is psychic. One face sees into the future, the other looks behind her, into the past.
You didn't just wander in here. You were called here at 6am by a number from a mystery phone.
Yes. Please, go. It's not like we've got a ticking clock or anything.
Forty one minutes.

You could flee across all of time and all of the universe, it would still find you.
At least give him a merciful death.
No, no, no, we don't have. Can I not be the good cop?
Oh, yes. Well, forget about cops, right? Forget about finding the real killer. You  heard Ashildr. All we have to do is persuade these creatures that it isn't Rigsy. And fast.
Are you sure it wasn't someone from the street?
I've identified twenty seven different species on this street so far, fifteen of whom are known for aggression. Why is it so hard to believe that one of them is capable of murder?
Why not? What's so special about her?
So you just want the human dead, is that it?
So you'll just let Rigsy die?
A what?
Shut up! Shut up. The other thing you said, the second thing. What, what, what, you said he was scared and?
Shh. Did he say
Clara gave you my number for emergencies. So when you wake up with a  weird tattoo on your neck and no memory of the last twenty four hours, the first thing you do is call the Doctor.
But you find yourself accused of murder on a strange alien  street in the middle of London. Only they've taken your phone, so you beg the woman in charge to call me instead. She
There's something very wrong here and we're running out of time.
The Mayor. What is she up to? It's nothing good, is it?
They usually do. If what Ashildr is doing is harmless, then we'll just walk out of that  door. No one will know of your abilities. But if it's not
This isn't about Rigsy. It's about me.
Afraid of what? Of whom?
You hold your tongue. We've got ten minutes left!
Ashildr said Anah was being taken home for burial. But the Janus burn their dead.
There's something about this tech
It looks like medical data.
This thing's a stasis pod. If you're dead, it's a kind of fancy  refrigerator. But if you're alive
It simply keeps you that  way.
She's alive.
There must be a way to unlock it. Something basic, something simple that I'm missing.
A keyhole would be very handy, yes, but I haven't got one.
No, Anahson, stay here. There's a reason that the Mayor has gone AWOL. She  means for us to release your mother, but she doesn't want us to use
This girl needs her mother. Ah!
I can't
There are easier ways to steal a key, you know.
What is this, Ashildr? You can't possibly think this is going to keep me here.
Where are
They? Who are they?
In your terms, my last will and testament.
I've no idea.
Clara, you didn't!
Who told you to give it to her?
What exactly did Rump say?
But what?
No. (to Ashildr) But you can. Fix this. Fix it now.
Yes, it is, you can, and you will, or this street will be over. I'll  show you and all your funny little friends to the whole laughing world. I'll bring UNIT, I'll bring the Zygons. Give me a minute, I'll bring the  Daleks and the Cybermen. You will save Clara, and you will do it now, or I will rain hell on you for the rest of time.
I can do whatever the hell I like. You've read the stories. You know who  I am. And in all of that time, did you ever hear anything about anyone who stopped me?
The Doctor is no longer here! You are stuck with me. And I will end you, and everything you love.
Now!
I don't care.
No, I don't.
Do what?
No. This, this isn't happening. This can't be happening.
This is my fault.
I let you get  reckless.
Clara, there's nothing special about me. I am nothing, but I'm less  breakable than you. I should have taken care of you.
You shouldn't have to ask.
What's the point of being a Doctor if I can't cure you?
What about me?
Clara.
Don't run. Stay with me.
Clara
What Clara said about not taking revenge. Do you know why she said that?
I was lost a long time ago. She was saving

You know I can't give up, Jo. It's far too important.
Now don't you start.
Well, I didn't expect there would be. No, his Tardis is working again now. He could be anywhere in space and time.
You're wasting your time, Brigadier.
Your agents are always picking up traces of the Master.
Well, look what happened last time. The man they arrested turned out to be the Spanish ambassador. Well, there you are. That's done it.
I've made myself a completely new dematerialization circuit. One that'll bypass the Time Lords homing control. I hope.
Oh, no. No, I've been doing all this work for fun.
A game?
Why not step inside and see for yourself?
Yes. That's because the Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.
It means that it's bigger inside than out. Now then.
That's impossible!
What?
Well, I can't, Jo. I think we're taking off!
I'm trying to. Something's operating it by remote control.
The Time Lords!
I can't, Jo. We've taken off.
At the moment we're nowhere.
We're outside the space time continuum.
Look.
I've no idea. We'll just have to wait until we emerge.
The planet Uxarieus. So that's our destination.
I don't know, Jo. I just don't know.
That is where we are.
Because the atmosphere out there might be poisonous, that's why. I'll just check.
Is it what?
No. No, it's quite healthy. Similar to Earth before the invention of the motor car.
I can but try.
That's an alien world out there, Jo. Think of it.
Look, do you realize how long I've been confined to one planet?
Well, of course it was true! Before I was stranded on Earth, I spent all my time exploring new worlds and seeking the wonders of the universe.
Then let's find out. Don't you want to set foot in another world?
Good. Come on. We'll just take a quick look around, and then I'll try and get you back to Earth. All right?
They're tracks made by some sort of machine. This planet must be inhabited after all. I think we'll get a better view from up there. Come on, what are you waiting for?
Come on, Jo. Nothing to worry about.
They look like some sort of prefabricated dwellings. Oh look, there's another one. A small one up there. Let's go and take a look at them.
Yes, all right. But, er, do you mind if I take a look at that rock first? It's rather unusual.
How do you do? Well, I must say this is all most impressive.
We come from Earth.
Look, we are not mineralogists. And even if we were, why all the hostility? It's a respectable profession.
Look, we've as much right to be here as anybody else.
Haven't you got laws to deal with this kind of thing?
I see. Yes well, I can sympathize with you, gentlemen, but I can assure you that I'm not working for anybody.
Pure chance. My spaceship developed a fault. I had to land somewhere.
Papers? No, they're back in my spaceship. If you'd like to come back there with me, I
Yes, go with them. It's all right, Jo. I'll join you in a moment.
These are your crop records, I take it?
It's a very poor showing, isn't it? Are you operating above subsistence level?
Unless I'm very much mistaken, you've got far more to worry about than mineralogists.
Unless things improve radically, you're in grave danger of starving to death.
Let's see if I've got this right. You brought your colonists to this planet just over a year ago.
You set up your main dome here, with all your subsidiary domes around it.
And you were convinced that this planet was suitable for habitation, despite the exhaustion of the soil?
Exactly. Should have.
Well, in theory, you should have a bumper crop by now.
No, no, of course not. Well, in practical terms, what you must do is this
Didn't you say you'd sent some men down there?
I'll come with you, if I may.
Scientific curiosity, my dear chap. I find your planet most intriguing.
Jo, don't worry about me. I'll be careful. Now go and get some sleep.
And what happened?
I doubt it. Come and take a look at these claw marks, gentlemen.
Are you trying to tell me these were made by a giant lizard, Winton?
Twenty foot high?
Then will you kindly tell me how a creature twenty feet high came through that door?
Ashe is perfectly right. There is no reason why this planet should not support a thriving colony.
Yes. Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.
Because they are being inhibited by some unnatural force. We must track it down and overcome it.
Whatever it was you saw can be destroyed.
It's all right, old chap, You're amongst friends now.
Lizards?
I only hope you're right.
Do they have a language of their own?
Extraordinary. Must be some rudimentary telepathic ability. Are they friendly?
I've no idea. Possibly some evidence to convince your colonists to stay.
Just play for time.
Yes. Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you very much. You know, you really ought to keep this thing of yours under better control.
Well, I only wish I knew. Something attacked this place late last night.
No. No, it belonged to two colonists.
It appears they were wrong, doesn't it. May I ask what you're doing here?
How long have you been here?
Why? Presumably you'll be moving to another planet.
I'm just making a few tests.
I'm every kind of scientist. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Well, I'd like to, but I haven't really got the time. In any case, I ought to get back and tell the colonists that you've arrived.
Yes, well, I suppose I could spare you a few moments.
What gave you that impression?
No, I didn't say anything of the sort. The two colonists that were living here have been killed.
That's right.
What are you doing?
How far is your ship?
The Tardis. It's gone!
Thank you.
Yes, of course.
Right.
Not Mister, Doctor. How do you do?
I'm glad you admit it. I take it you're preparing to leave at once.
Oh? Why?
The hostile animals, if they exist, can be found and destroyed, sir.
I'm not a colonist, I'm a visitor.
I'm very much concerned.
Earth, or your corporation's profits?
What those people need, my dear sir, are new worlds to live in like this one. Worlds where they can live like human beings, not battery hens.
Even if it means turning this planet into a slagheap?
Perhaps. Your health, sir. Now, if you'll excuse me. I've lost some very valuable equipment. Perhaps one of your colleagues told you about it. A tall blue box.
Who the blazes are you?
Well, why was this door locked?
Well, where is the man who brought me here? And what happened to Captain Dent?
Oh, I see. Well, I take it that your Captain is coming to see Ashe?
The leader of the colonists!
How very formal. Well, shall we go?
Why?
Yes, that's a point.
No!
Let's drive slowly, shall we?
Well, here are are. Though I must say I still don't quite understand why you wanted to come here.
Well, you'll find some claw marks over there and some more over there.
That's right. Oh yes, it was all very efficiently done.
Well, I think the whole thing has been faked by somebody who wanted to frighten the colonists away.
Yes, they could have been faked by some sort of mechanical device.
Yes. Yes, exactly like this.
If you fire that thing, you'll spoil your whole story. Monsters don't carry guns, you know.
Yes, I'm fine Jo, fine. Sorry if that spoils your plans, Captain Dent.
I was to have been another victim of their imaginary monsters. They're trying to frighten you off this planet.
Yes, and one that I shall have great pleasure in bringing before the proper authorities. You say there's some sort of procedure?
Good. I'm sure he'll be very interested in hearing what I have to say.
Oh, yes. Yes, the IMC people are using a robot to fake these monsters.
Optical trickery so that you think you can see monsters and a robot with claws so that you can see their effects. The immobilized robot is at Leeson's dome. Or it was. They've probably removed it by now.
Yes, well, don't worry, old chap. When the adjudicator hears of IMC's methods, he's bound to decide in your favour.
Why shouldn't we still be here?
Well, I'd be only too pleased, but at the moment I'm looking for some lost property. It's a box, a tall blue box like
Well, no, I haven't exactly lost it. Let's say it's temporarily mislaid.
Yes, all right. Come on. Show me what's wrong.
Later, Jo, later.
There you are. I think that should do it.
Eh? Oh, as long as you want it to, of course. You say that somebody else has been trying to repair this relay circuit?
He didn't make a very good job. In fact one might almost think that he's been trying to make things worse.
What?
What about?
All right, Captain Dent, where's Jo Grant?
You've got no right to hold her without
I see. All right, what do you want?
That's quite out of the question, and I repeat, where is Jo Grant!
What?
What good will that do? Dent'll deny everything and you'll be putting Jo's life at risk.
Dent's spaceship is only a few hundred yards from this dome. He'll be monitoring us on his scanners.
Use your head, man! If he sees the slightest sign of a search, he'll detonate that charge.
Winton, where's Jo?
What, you left her?
Well, how did you get away?
You've got to stop him. Dent'll shoot them down and be glad of the excuse!
Did you say one of them helped you?
Well, where was he?
Can you direct me there?
I've got to talk to him. The only way we can save Jo now is with help from the inside.
Ah, Caldwell. Working out your future bonuses?
I want your help.
Did you know that Captain Dent had given orders to have me killed?
Or that they've taken Jo Grant prisoner and may kill her?
Tomorrow morning, the colonists are going to attack your spaceship.
I know. That's why I'm here. There's something that you can do to help me.
Release Jo Grant before the attack starts.
You make a frontal attack like that, and Dent'll blast you down without a second's thought.
What difference does that make? That ship is like a fortress and the men are trained. By the time the Adjudicator arrives, well, he will have killed them all and claimed it was self-defence.
I see. Well, you leave me no alternative. If I can't stop you, I must help you.
By giving you a piece of good advice. Unless you want IMC warned, I'd keep a very close watch of our friend Norton.
By helping you devise a less idiot plan of attack.
Excuse me.
All right, Dent. Where's Jo Grant?
Is this true?
I'll leave them to you.
All I can do is go down to those Primitive ruins and start searching from there.
Good. Well, Winton seems to have seized control. I only hope he can keep it.
We've got to find out what's happening in those Primitive ruins, and where they've taken Jo.
Oh, seems as if the Primitives are no longer friendly.
Yes, and Morgan tried to kill another. Where would the Primitives have taken Jo, to their city?
Afraid?
Well, did they find them?
My dear Ashe, if the Primitives have taken Jo to their city, I must go after her.
What else can I do?
What?
Well, I can't just sit here and wait! In any case, I haven't got any food to offer them.
But you're running short.
Thank you.
I've come to bring back the girl. Well, Ashe will come and give you food if you come and return her. Look, I know you can understand me. You can read my mind. I've come to buy back the girl.
Thank you.
It's all right, Jo. It's all right, I'm here now.
Wait, wait! We must talk!
What other one?
Is it humanoid?
That's interesting. There must be two races on this planet.
Don't you worry about that, my dear. I'm going to buy you back.
That's right, just a simple business transaction. You know, judging by the room and this machinery, it could have been a highly advanced civilisation.
It went into a decline. These Primitives could be descendants of a tremendously advanced race.
That's extraordinary. A sort of chronicle, history. Buildings, cities, machines. They even invented flight.
Hmm? Oh. Buildings in ruins, people lying dead. Some great catastrophe, I should think. After that everything changes. Yes, look at this, Jo. A completely different style and design. Much cruder, more primitive.
It looks like some sort of sacrifice. Jo, there. Would you say that was some sort of time mechanism?
How do you do?
Don't move, Jo. I think he's almost blind. I've come to take this young lady back. If you go to Ashe's dome, he will give you food.
I've no idea. But if want to get out of here, we'd better distract him somehow.
After you, Miss Grant.
Jo, I don't think he can see us. Come on.
Let's not wait to find out.
Checkmate, I'm afraid, Miss Grant.
It's like a reactor.
I came to take her back.
We have no wish to offend your laws. The race that built this city were intelligent, civilised. They wouldn't condemn the innocent.
Surely the basis of all true law is justice. Look, we're both strangers to your planet. The girl was brought here by your warriors as a captive. All we ask is to be allowed to leave in peace.
Thank you, sir. And may I say that I'm overjoyed to find that justice prevails in your city.
Well, it was a being of tremendous intelligence, probably one of the rulers of this city. Three different races or three mutations of the same race?
Yes, you're quite right. Let's get back to the space dome.
And why are you impersonating the Adjudicator?
Rubbish.
Nobody sends me anywhere. I'm a free agent.
Well, my immediate plans are to expose you as an imposter.
Forged, of course.
Don't be absurd.
Bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo.
Oh, is that what you plan to do?
Winton again?
I can't, Jo. He wouldn't understand.
Yes, well, the Master came to this planet for a purpose, Jo. I'd like to hear what he has to say when Ashe goes to see him.
Now you stay here! I've got to try and stop this senseless killing.
And what's that supposed to mean?
I agree. Don't you agree, Adjudicator?
You seem to have achieved a temporary victory, young man. What do you think is going to happen next?
I urge you not to trust this man. He's an imposter.
I tell you that he's not the Adjudicator. If he wants to go to the Primitive city, it's for some purpose of his own.
Why don't you check his credentials with Earth?
Don't be absurd.
I repeat, do not trust that man!
The Master has them eating out of his hand.
I tried to.
No, why should they? I've got to get some real evidence.
In his Tardis, perhaps?
My dear Jo, a Tardis can change its shape, you know. He changed his to look like the Adjudicator's spaceship.
With this. (a key) Don't you remember? When the Master first came to Earth, I got a hold of the key to his Tardis. I always thought it might come in useful.
Yes. A slightly more advanced model, actually.
Jo, stop. Don't move.
There's an alarm beam here somewhere. Now move back very slowly one pace. Now stand quite still. There it is. This doesn't give us much room to get under. About a foot. Right, get very flat, on the ground. All right?
Quite flat. Wriggle away. That's it, wriggle away.
Come on, Right, that's it. Stay there. Right, give me your hand.
Good. Well done, Jo. Right, now let's see what we can find before the Master gets back.
Ah.
It's a mineralogical survey report about this planet.
Duralinium. There's a lot of other survey reports here too. He's visited a lot of planets recently. He must be looking for something.
Ah ha. Now that's more like it. Well done, Jo. I'll look after these, if you don't mind.
Yes, of course I am. But I'd like to find out why the Master came to this planet.
I'm coming, Jo, I'm coming. Jo, you're standing in the alarm beam!
Gas!
What have you done, what have you done to her this time?
What stopped you?
What do you want there?
I take it that Miss Grant is to be held here as a hostage. You know, you really are most unimaginative.
You realise, of course, it can be extremely dangerous taking you to the Primitive city?
Yeah, well, you stay there. I'll go and shift that irrigation pipe.
I'll remember. Look out!
This is just the beginning.
What, with this? Somewhat clapped out and broken, isn't it?
Why not?
This is it. This is the entrance.
I haven't the remotest idea.
What's that bleeping noise?
No, you can't!
No!
They don't speak. They're telepathic.
Well, it looks like some sort of lumber room. Take a look at this frieze here. I think it might interest you.
It's a sort of chronicle of their history, showing that their science has deteriorated into a somewhat primitive religion.
Is it? Well, perhaps you'd be kind enough to explain it to me?
Yes, I had rather gathered that.
You deduced all that from these pictures?
Oh, so that's more like it. You mean that you stole the information?
Tell me, why are you so interested in the history of this planet?
Why not? Super-weapons usually are eventually.
I see. And so the super race became priests of a lunatic religion worshipping machines instead of gods.
Well, may I remind you that their religion embraces sacrifice, and that we are the destined victims?
You're going to use this weapon?
I think you've left it a trifle late.
What about me?
Which way do we go now?
Is it? Well, where is this super weapon of yours?
I do know a little basic astronomy.
In about ten thousand million years time, yes.
That's unbelievable!
The cloud of cosmic matter that was once a sun? Of course.
So, you intend to hold the universe to ransom.
No, absolute power is evil.
No, I will not join you in your absurd dreams of a galactic conquest.
What for? What is the point?
You'll never understand, will you? I want to see the universe, not rule it.
Wait and see.
The ultimate development of life on this planet.
Don't listen to him, sir.
On the contrary. He'll bring only death and destruction.
Tell me, sir, has this weapon of yours ever brought good to your planet?
Exactly. The weapon has only brought death, and yet he wants to spread that death throughout the galaxy! Unless you destroy this weapon, sir, he will use it for evil.
Not only does justice prevail on your planet, sir, but also infinite compassion.
Thank you, sir.
Come back! You'll all be killed!
Jo, what are you doing here?
We've got to get out of here at once. The whole place is going up! You have a map. Give it to me.
Yes, I think this is it. Come on.
Look!
Now look, stop worrying. It was the radiation from that weapon that was poisoning the soil. Your cover crops will grow now.
Ashe?
And Ashe insisted on staying on board. Yes. Yes, he would, of course.
My dear chap, this is absolutely splendid. Where did you find it?
Well, I cannot tell you how grateful I am.
What is it? Well, er, it's, er, it's a sort of antique really, but it does have great sentimental value. Will you excuse us?
As far as he's concerned, we haven't. The Tardis returned to Earth just a few seconds after it left.
Don't try and explain Jo. He'd never understand.

It's mauve.
The universally recognised colour for danger.
That's just humans. By everyone else's standards, red's camp. Oh, the misunderstandings. All those red alerts, all that dancing. It's got a very basic flight computer. I've hacked in, slaved the Tardis. Where it goes, we go.
Totally.
Okay, reasonably. Should have said reasonably there. No, no, no, no! It's jumping time tracks, getting away from us.
No idea.
It's mauve and dangerous, and about thirty seconds from the centre of London.
Do you know how long you can knock around space without happening to bump into Earth?
Of all the species in all the Universe and it has to come out of a cow.
Must have come down somewhere quite close. Within a mile, anyway. And it can't have been more than a few weeks ago. Maybe a month.
It was jumping time tracks all over the place. We're bound to be a little bit out. Do you want to drive?
A bit.
Ish.
Rose, it hit the middle of London with a very loud bang. I'm going to ask.
It's psychic paper. It tells you
Sorry.
Door, music, people. What do you think?
Are you sure about that t-shirt?
Come on if you're coming. It won't take a minute.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Could I have everybody's attention just for a mo? Be very quick. Hello! Might seem like a stupid question, but has anything fallen from the sky recently?
Sorry, have I said something funny? It's just, there's this thing that I need to find. Would've fallen from the sky a couple of days ago.
Would've landed quite near here. With a very loud
Bang.
Rose?
You know, one day, just one day, maybe, I'm going to meet someone who gets the whole don't wander off thing. Nine hundred years of phone box travel, it's the only thing left to surprise me.
How can you be ringing? What's that about, ringing? What am I supposed to do with a ringing phone?
And how do you know that?
Well, if you know so much, tell me this. How can it be ringing? It's not even a real phone. It's not connected, it's not
Hello? Hello? This is the Doctor speaking. How may I help you?
Who is this? Who's speaking?
Who is this?
How did you ring here? This isn't a real phone. It's not wired up to anything.
Rose? Rose, are you in there?
Thanks, miss!
Good here, innit? Who's got the salt?
So, you lot, what's the story?
You're homeless, right? Living rough?
Of course I'm not a copper. What's a copper going to do with you lot anyway? Arrest you for starving? I make it 1941. You lot shouldn't even be in London. You should've been evacuated to the country by now.
So why'd you come back?
So, that's what you do, is it, Nancy?
As soon as the sirens go, you find a big fat family meal still warm on the table with everyone down in the air raid shelter and bingo! Feeding frenzy for the homeless kids of London Town. Puddings for all, as long as the bombs don't get you.
Wrong with it? It's brilliant. I'm not sure if it's Marxism in action or a West End musical.
I want to know how a phone that isn't a phone gets a phone call. You seem to be the one to ask.
Great, thanks. And I want to find a blonde in a Union Jack. I mean a specific one. I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving. Anybody seen a girl like that?
What have I done wrong?
Yeah, there is actually. Thanks for asking. Something I've been looking for. Would've fallen from the sky about a month ago, but not a bomb. Not the usual kind, anyway. Wouldn't have exploded. Probably would have just buried itself in the ground somewhere, and it would have looked something like this.
What's this, then? It's never easy being the only child left out in the cold, you know.
I do actually, yes.
Are you all right?
What happens if he touches me?
And what's he like?
Nancy, what's he like?
Your mummy isn't here.
No mummies here. Nobody here but us chickens. Well, this chicken.
Why are those other children frightened of you?
Okay. I'm opening the door now.
I'm good at following, me. Got the nose for it.
My nose has special powers.
What?
What?
What are you trying to say?
Nancy, there's something chasing you and the other kids. Looks like a boy and it isn't a boy, and it started about a month ago, right? The thing I'm looking for, the thing that fell from the sky, that's when it landed. And you know what I'm talking about, don't you?
Take me there.
Try me.
I really want to know.
And who might that be?
What about it?
For now, I'm more interested in getting in there.
Why?
Where're you going?
Can I ask you a question? Who did you lose?
The way you look after all those kids. It's because you lost somebody, isn't it? You're doing all this to make up for it.
What happened?
Amazing.
1941. Right now, not very far from here, the German war machine is rolling up the map of Europe. Country after country, falling like dominoes. Nothing can stop it. Nothing. Until one, tiny, damp little island says no. No. Not here. A mouse in front of a lion. You're amazing, the lot of you. Don't know what you do to Hitler, but you frighten the hell out of me. Off you go then do what you've got to do. Save the world.
Yes, I saw. Why are they still wearing gas masks?
I'm, er. Are you the doctor?
Nancy sent me.
Yes.
Nothing. Why I was asking. What do you know?
These people, they were all caught up in the blast?
You're very sick.
I have my moments.
No.
Which one?
Massive head trauma, mostly to the left side. Partial collapse of the chest cavity, mostly to the right. There's some scarring on the back of the hand and the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh, but I can't see any burns.
This isn't possible.
This isn't possible.
They've all got the same injuries.
Exactly the same.
Identical, all of them, right down to the scar on the back of the hand.
How did this happen? How did it start?
Dead?
The head trauma.
Asphyxiation.
The collapse of the chest cavity
All right. What was the cause of death?
And they've just been left here? Nobody's doing anything?
Just you? You're the only one here?
Yeah. I know the feeling.
Probably too late.
Nancy?
Mister Spock?
Nine centuries in, I'm coping. Where've you been? We're in the middle of a London Blitz. It's not a good time for a stroll.
What?!
Chula?
What kind of Chula ship landed here?
What kind of warship?
This started at the bomb site. It's got everything to do with it. What kind of warship?
Human DNA is being rewritten by an idiot.
I don't know. Some kind of virus converting human beings into these things. But why? What's the point?
I don't know.
Don't let them touch you.
You're looking at it.

Well, you're right about the castle bit. It used to be a fortress in the Middle Ages.
Thanks, Jo.
Smile, Jo.
You're on camera.
Oh, good morning. Er, observers from UNIT. My admission pass.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
Morbid lot of sensation seekers.
Scientific curiosity, my dear.
Something's been worrying me about this Keller process ever since I first heard of it. Ah, the curtain is about to go up.
Good morning.
(sotto) It all depends what you mean by progress, doesn't it.
(sotto) People who talk about infallibility are usually on very shaky ground, I think.
It doesn't.
Oh, yes. Yes, please do.
Where do they go after that?
Which is now full of these negative or evil impulses.
I knew there was something evil about that machine.
(sotto) Satisfactorily be blowed.
I admire your confidence, sir.
Then would you kindly explain, sir, that unfortunate man's reaction?
In other words, you don't know.
UNIT, sir, was set up to deal with new and unusual menaces to mankind. And in my view, this machine of yours is just that. Jo.
Is he dead?
Perhaps, but I doubt it. Might I suggest an immediate investigation into his past medical history and a post mortem.
Bites and scratches? Yes, I know.
Yes, I agree, Jo, but not just yet. Now, let me get that post mortem first. It'll give me more to go on.
Hmm?
All about what?
And you are still convinced this Keller process is working normally?
Yes. Yes, I've seen him.
Yes, I know. But I still don't like it.
Interfering with the mind, Governor. It's a dangerous business.
Professor Kettering, it is everyone's concern!
Yes, yes, yes, but what did he die of?
Anything in his medical history?
Oh, which ones?
Rats?
Tell me, these marks on his face on his face and neck, these bites and scratches, could they have been caused by rats?
But Linwood is dead.
No, Professor Kettering, because of this machine.
If I were a scientist? Let me tell you, sir, that I am a scientist, and I have been for several thousand. Jo.
Oh, come on, man, come on.
Well?
Like the rats?
Yes, a good idea. How long would you say he'd been dead?
Yes, exactly.
This machine has the power to affect men's minds, Governor, and it's growing stronger.
Yes, maybe, but nevertheless it's dangerous and it should be destroyed now!
I wonder how many deaths it'll take to convince them?
Yes. Yes, all right. Well, I'd better make this machine safe.
On my own.
Perhaps not.
But I prefer to work that way. Tell me, how long has this machine been installed?
I see. Did he have an assistant?
Jo. Jo, what are you doing here?
Look, I told you to take that directly to the Governor's office.
So are my instructions, Jo. So are my instructions. You might have been killed.
Well, it was there, Jo. At least it was until you distracted it. Your coming in broke its grip on my mind. Let me see that report.
So he drowned in a perfectly dry room.
Fire.
Well, some time ago, Jo, I witnessed a terrible catastrophe. A whole world just, just disappeared in flames. Well, this machine picked that memory out of my mind and used it to attack me.
Neither was the water, nor the rats, yet Linwood is dead and so is Professor Kettering. We believe what our minds tell us to, Jo.
Because those idiots in authority won't let me, that's why. I'm trying to find a way of controlling it. So, if you've quite finished asking questions?
Nonsense. I can't possibly leave Stangmoor.
I'm telling you I'm not leaving.
Venusian Karate. I think you'll find that a lot harder than you imagine, young man.
Murdered? Yes, all right, Captain Yates. I'll come with you.
Look, Jo, for once in your young life, do you think you could do exactly as I ask?
Now go and see the Governor. Tell him to lock and bar that door. No one is to enter this room. No one. Do you understand?
Yes. Yes, I'm rather afraid I'll have to. Try and keep out of trouble, will you?
Come along, Captain Yates, what are you waiting for?
I see you're in your usual sweet affable mood, Brigadier.
Right, now, Brigadier, would you kindly tell me what all this fuss is about?
And you'll back up my report to the Home Office calling for a complete ban on the Keller process.
And you'll get in touch with the Home Secretary and make sure that he takes some action.
My dear Lethbridge Stewart, your word is my command. You know that you only have to ask.
Well, where on earth do you think you're going?
Fu Peng? He must be Hokien.
Yes, it's going to be one of those days. Cheshire cat, Captain Yates, Cheshire cat.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm coming.
(in Hokien) This unworthy person welcomes you and delights in your safe arrival.
Oh, thank you. Actually I fear my Hokien is somewhat rusty.
Well, it's many years since I've had a chance to use it.
I remember once having a conversation with Tse-Tung.
He himself gave me leave to use it.
Kam si ya.
Wa hi, Peng-san. I should be delighted to dine with you soon.
Dried squid and stewed jellyfish, my dear fellow. For our dinner. Beng ahn, my dear Peng-san.
Come along, my dear fellow. We've got a great deal of work to do, you know.
Another mysterious death with unexplained marks on the face and body? There's got to be.
Off for another little trip, Captain Yates?
The what?
I thought they'd outlawed those things?
With the peace conference going on it's not the most tactful time to be trundling rockets about, is it?
Chinese girl? What Chinese girl?
Brigadier, what Chinese girl?!
That's it then. That's the link.
When Emil Keller installed his machine at Stangmoor prison, he had a Chinese girl with him as an assistant.
Coincidence, my foot. You'd better put out a general alert for that Chinese girl, Brigadier. She's got to be found and quick!
Look, operator, I've been waiting some considerable time now for my call to Stangmoor prison.
Yes, all right, yes. I'll hang on. There's some trouble there with the lines.
Chin Lee? Where?
No, Brigadier!
A collective hallucination, gentlemen, nothing more. Who's that?
No, but he's suffering from acute shock.
Yes?
Well, it's a telepathic amplifier.
No, not caused them. No, it merely picks up the impulses and projects them through Chin Lee's mind.
Well, unless I'm very much mistaken, from the Keller machine at Stangmoor prison.
Wa ai, Peng-san. Wa ai. Chin Lee was being used by someone who was trying to drive this world into war.
Yes, I will if I can.
Hang ahn, Peng-san.
May God go with you also.
Chin Lee? Chin Lee, listen to me. Can you hear me?
Cantonese. Noh, hi lay pen lau Chin Lee. Ala mar. Ala mar? You must trust me.
Yes, I know, but it was in your mind. It was only in your mind. Now I want to ask you some questions.
Yes. About Emil Keller and your visit to Stangmoor prison.
Rise and shine, Brigadier. I've brought Captain Chin Lee here to see you.
Right now, Brigadier. I think you'll find that Captain Chin Lee can cast considerable light on what's been happening.
Yes, well tell him to be careful with his, er, cargo.
Post-hypnotic block. His usual technique.
Well, think, man! Who else would make a deliberate attempt to plunge this world into war, using equipment and techniques not even developed on Earth, like this.
Otherwise known as Emil Keller!
Well, let her go, of course. Well, she's not a criminal. Anyway, she can't do any more harm now that I've got this.
Is Jo all right?
Well?
Yes?
Passes. Television.
Don't point that thing at me, man. It might go off! I'm here on official business. I understand there's been some trouble here.
I was going there anyway.
Yes. Yes, I thought as much.
Hardly. How's the riot going?
Do you? And, er, where is Miss Grant to be found?
Is she indeed. Well, let me tell you this, that if you harm so much as one hair of her head, I'll
Why the delay? I take it that I'm to be killed eventually?
You want me to help you with that machine of yours. Professor Keller. You want to be careful of that thing, you know. One day it's going to end up killing you.
Huh!
Oh? What other business?
Well, it's a lunatic scheme. Still, that's only to be expected.
I see.
Jo? Jo, where are you?
Right, I'm coming!
May I ask the purpose of this charade?
You know, this is all very tiresome.
Then why don't you?
You wanted. You wanted to know how long I could hold out against that machine. Well, the answer is I can't. Nobody can.
No, no.
Be that as it may, I know the secret of that machine. Inside is a creature that feeds on the evil of the mind, and very soon it'll feed on yours.
That's wrong, wrong metabolism. It'd probably kill me, Jo. I'm all right. I'm all right, Jo. Just, just let me rest. Let me rest.
Well done, my dear. Now perhaps we can do something about getting out of here.
I do have remarkable powers of recovery, don't I? Come on!
They'll be expecting us to try and make a break for it.
No, not while they're all chasing around. Let them cool off for a bit. We'll try again later.
There is, but it's locked.
In any case, it'll be manned by convicts.
That, my dear Jo, is the Thunderbolt. Captain Yates is escorting it. I hope.
Everything. He's hoping to steal it.
Why not? It's the safest place at the moment. They'll never think of looking for us here. Besides, I need more time to think. I've got to find out a way of dealing with that alien creature out there.
The one inside the Keller machine.
I do.
It's a sort of mind parasite that feeds on evil. The deadliest threat to mankind since the beginning of time.
Mmm?
Right. Now's our chance.
I didn't mean our chance to escape, Jo. I meant our chance to get into that process chamber and deal with that machine once and for all.
No, thank you. You were trained to use those things. They only make me nervous.
Perhaps the creature's learned to move. Come on.
Yes.
Yes, well, before you pull that trigger, I
Look, look behind you.
Look behind you!
Well, we couldn't have tempted its appetite.
Well, I imagine it detected a higher concentration of evil in Mailer. There's something to be said for a pure mind, after all, eh, Jo?
Yes, all right, Jo! Jo! Wait a minute. Wait.
Look, we've got to stop the Master from launching that missile. Now come on, Barnham, you come with us.
Well, there doesn't seem to be anybody about. Let's take a look outside. (to Barnham) You wait here for a minute.
Let him go. Let him go!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Look, Mailer, what
Mailer, why are you helping the Master?
The Ma, er, er, Keller or whatever he calls himself.
Oh, what's he promised you?
Do you really think he's going to keep those promises?
Let us go and I'll do the best I can for you.
Shush, shush, shush, shush. (The Doctor takes one of Jo's red pieces.)
There.
Yes, well, the trouble with this game is that it's too simple. In any case, I'm more used to playing three dimensional chess.
I suppose you're going to ask me to control that machine of yours again.
Yes, well, I can't. I've told you before. Nobody can.
Well, even if I could, why should I help you?
Yeah. Most of them hard cases that were helping you.
My own?
Well, it's only a theory, but I think there may be one way to inhibit that machine's power of movement.
Well where's the thing now? Still wandering about?
Well, I shall need a lot of equipment, you know.
All right, I'll give it a try.
I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, thank you. Right. Excuse me, will you?
Would you mind bringing that plug with you, please?
And the coil.
Thank you.
I'm going to try throwing this coil over that machine in there. If I can get close enough to it without being killed, that is.
Well, I want you to operate these controls here and switch on to full power when I call out.
If all goes well, it should set up an electric current in the coil alternating on much the same frequency as the beta rhythms of the human brain.
I don't know, but I think it'll confuse the creature enough to take away its power of movement anyway.
So do I.
Now switch it on now, will you? Bottom one.
Thank you. Right, you know what to do.
Now!
Now!
It won't hold it for long, you know. That thing's intelligent. Soon it'll work out what happened and find a way to deal with it.
Yes, thank you, Jo. I'm fine, I'm fine.
Yes, temporarily.
I am. Physically and mentally.
I doubt it. Not after what happened last time.
Well, we shouldn't have thrown our breakfast at them, should we?
Oh, no thanks, Jo, you have it. I'll do without food for a while.
Oh, all right. Cheers.
Huh. Did I ever tell you about the time I was in the Tower of London?
No?
Well, I shared a cell with a very strange chap called Raleigh.
Yeah, Sir Walter Raleigh.
He got into some trouble with Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth the first, that is. He kept going on about this new vegetable of his he'd discovered, you see, called the potato. One day, he sat down, pointed a finger at me
Yes. I only hope they can gain complete control before Mailer starts killing the hostages.
Hmm? Oh, yes.
Ah, come to give yourself up?
Well?
Thank you, Brigadier. But do you think that for once in your life you could manage to arrive before the nick of time?
I see you've changed your job.
What about the missile?
No.
Yes, well, apart from losing the Master and the missile, you're doing very well, Brigadier.
Look, the Master has got to be found, Brigadier.
Well, it comes to the same thing, surely.
His name is Barnham. He's the last man to undergo the Keller process and you can see what it's done to him. He's got the mind of a child. Don't worry about him. You leave him to Jo. He trusts her. Right, let's take a look of this map of yours.
It's Captain Yates.
Mmm?
Does it?
You may not find the Master all that easy to mop up, Brigadier.
Well, don't forget he's got that rocket full of nerve gas. He can point it at any city in Europe.
No, not for the moment. I've got to work out a way of destroying that machine of his. If I can step up the voltage in that coil
Yes, yes, all right.
Right, that's it. That should just about do it, I think.
Oh my! The thing's escaped again!
Well, it must stored up its energy and blown all the circuits. Let's have a look.
Well, it's stronger than ever now. How on earth am I going to stop it?
No, that'd never work twice. The thing's too intelligent. In any case, I doubt whether I'd get near enough to it without being killed.
Barnham, get out of here! Get back!
Barnham, come back! Come back! Come back!
Over here!
Don't be frightened by it! Don't be frightened. That's it, that's it. As long as you're here, it won't hurt us. Right, stay there. Stay there. Sit yourself down, that's it.
The mind of evil, Jo. I should have realised. That creature feeds on the evil impulses of the brain.
No, the machine extracted them all. Something in his mind acts as a screen and neutralises it. So long as he's here, we're perfectly safe.
No. No, these creatures are incredibly resilient, Jo. It'd take an atomic explosion or an enormous charge of electricity to destroy that.
Well, I'm going to see. I'm going to see Sergeant Benton. Will you wait here? Will you be all right until I get back?
Yes, I know. I'll be as quick as I possibly can, all right? Now, Jo will look after you.
Now, are you sure you've got all that?
Yes, please do. It's all extremely urgent.
Yes, I'm quite sure it is, but neverthe
Hello? Yes?
You have gathered correctly.
In spite of what I've said, do you still intend to fire that rocket on London?
Well, that would start a world war.
I see. Aren't you forgetting something?
The dematerialisation circuit from your own Tardis.
You can't leave Earth without that, can you.
I am. Hand me back that rocket and I'll return your circuit.
Leave Earth. Stop bothering us. Go somewhere else and be a nuisance elsewhere. Well, what do you say?
Well?
Sergeant, can you contact the Brigadier for me?
Get onto him at once. Tell him he's got to cancel that attack.
But understand that you mustn't go anywhere near him. If he catches sight of a uniform, he'll fire that rocket.
What do you mean, just in case? It's our only chance.
Now look, don't do anything stupid, Brigadier. He means what he says, you know.
Lethbridge Stewart!
I sincerely hope so. I'm going back to Miss Grant.
You just don't understand, do you, Jo? Once he gets that circuit back he's free to roam through time and space. We'd never catch him.
Jo, will you stop stating the obvious. What did you say?
Well, that's it. That's the answer. We've got the machine and we've got our friend, Barnham.
With a little help from you, old chap, we can destroy this machine and the Master at the same time.
Come on, old chap, come on.
That's it. All right? Now don't forget. Whatever you do, don't drop it. Now hang on to it tight. Pick it up.
Come on. That's it. Now, mind how you go. Mind how you go. All right? Not too heavy for you? Good, that's it. Now close the doors after us, will you, Sergeant?
Now mind his feet.
What did you expect? The Master may be a scoundrel but he is a scientist. He'll have disconnected the abort mechanism.
Oh, has it arrived?
Yes, that's it.
It's where he'll escape to that worries me. What right have we got to let his loose on some other planet?
My dear Brigadier, of course I have a better plan.
No, of course not. No, it's just that Bessie had broken down.
You know, Bessie?
That's very clever.
My word, you have done well.
Oh, yes. Here.
How do I know that you won't take the circuit and fire the missile anyway?
No, I don't think so.
Hai!
Right, Jo!
Come on!
He's dead. Come on, Jo. Jo, come on.
Yes, I know, Jo. I know.
Well, how do you think I feel?
Yes. Here, have some coffee.
Yes, we've probably killed off that machine all right, but I'm not so sure about the Master.
Yes, that's true.
The circuit. I must have lost it in my struggle with him.
Yes, but what if it wasn't? Supposing the Master found it?
The Master? Yes?
I'm extremely sorry to hear that.
So, we won't be seeing you for quite some time.
His usual threats.
Have I, Jo? He's got his Tardis back. He's free to come and go where he pleases, while I'm stuck here on Earth (pause) with you, Brigadier!

Clara!Clara?
Sorry, I was busy. What's happening?
Well, you're only human.
So what I can do for you, Clara?
Clara?
Where are we going?
From?
Well, normally you say work or kids or dishes or dullness. So what's happened?
I'm sorry?
What's so great about seeing a volcano? It's just a sort of leaky mountain.
It's rubbish.
You can't have one.
You still can't have one.
No, you can't have one.
So, volcano. What's so good about lava?
Clara, what are you doing? Don't. Be very, very careful with that. Those are very, very
Yes.
No. Not good, Clara.
Yeah?
And?
And?
No.
Well, I understand you. Let's not get carried away.
With precision. With great care. And not today. But you know that of course, otherwise you wouldn't be threatening me.
If I change the events that brought you here, you will never come here and ask me to change those events. Paradox loop. The timeline disintegrates. Your timeline. And yes!
Yes. I did just say no. Throw away the key.
I know when I can, I know when I can't. Throw the key.
I am in control. Throw away the key. Do as you are told.
Well, either you do as you're told or stop threatening me. There really isn't a third option here.
No.
No.
No!
Neither am I.
Clara, my Clara, I don't think you will!
Look in your hand.
Clara, look in your hand.
Clara, look in your hand.
Yes, yes, yes, there is. Look.
Did you seriously think that that was going to work on me?
They're not sleep patches. They induce a dream state.
Makes you very suggestible.
I allowed the whole scenario to play out just as you planned. I was curious about how far you would go.
Yeah. Now I know.
Yes, you're quite the mess of chemicals, aren't you?
Go to hell.
Clara? You asked me what we're going to do. I told you. We're going to hell. Or wherever it is people go when they die. If there is anywhere. Wherever it is, we're going to go there and we're going to find Danny. And if it is in any way possible, we're going to bring him home. Almost every culture in the universe has some concept of an afterlife. I always meant to have a look around, see if I could find one.
Well, why wouldn't I help you?
You betrayed me. Betrayed my trust, you betrayed our friendship, you betrayed everything that I've ever stood for. You let me down!
Why? Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference? Stop it with the eyes. Don't do that with the eyes. How do you do that anyway? It's like they inflate. Cut out the whining while you're at it. We've got work to do. This is it, Clara, one of those moments.
The darkest day. The blackest hour. Chin up, shoulders back. Let's see what we're made of, you and I. Switching off the safeguards, turning off the nav-com. Remember, we did this before. We plugged you into the Tardis telepathic interface.
Because you and he are linked. Strongly linked. Your timestreams are intertwined. So if he's anywhere at all, that link will hold. Give me your hands.
We're in a hurry.
Clara, I'm terribly sorry, but I'm exactly what you deserve.
Think about Danny. Think about the man you lost. Let it hurt. Let it burn. But don't bleat. Don't ask, why him? Why me? Forget all that. Ask one question. Just one. Ask, where is Danny Pink now? Where is he now?
Well, the Tardis thinks he's somewhere.
Nav-com's offline. We'll have to do this old school.
Almost certainly not. It's where there's a connection with Danny. According to the Tardis, this is where it's most likely that your timeline will re-intersect with his. And that won't do.
You won't. Look at you. I need sceptical, clever, critical. I don't need mopey. It put years on your face. And what if people see us together? It looks like you've been melted.
We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead, so buck up and give me some attitude.
In a mausoleum?
It means those are definitely not fish tanks.
I don't know.
No. They were placed, after death. These are tombs. Water tombs, some sort of fluid, anyway.
With chairs, yes. Extra comfort for the deceased. It pays to die rich.
Good point. Tombs with windows. Who wants to watch their loved ones rot? Why would anyone go to so much trouble just to keep watch on the dead?
Very. Why have the scrolling and a voice? Is it difficult?
Reading all those words back to front. Come on. We've come a long way.
Well, there is, er, no immediate hurry. We're just, er. We're just
Yeah, yeah, browsing.
Oh, good. That's good to know, Clara, isn't it?
Exactly what is 3W?
Well, you know, it's just an unexpected
(breathless) Clara, is it over now?
Who are you?
You're very er realistic.
Shut up.
Oh, yes, please. Please do that. Do that now right now.
I need to speak to whoever's in charge here.
Well, who's in charge of you?
Well, who repairs you? Who, who maintains you?
Who maintains your heart?
Doctor who?
Hello.
Are you okay?
Good. There would be something very wrong if you were.
How does the body keep its integrity? Why isn't it just a bunch of bones floating about?
So each skeleton is inside something?
Why?
I am thinking about it. Why?
I thought that you would never ask. Sort out your security protocols, they're a disgrace.
Oh, I've got a lot of internalised anger. What does 3W stand for?
Never mind what we know and what we don't know, just answer our question.
We're not going to freak out.
She'll be fine.
Of course. It's the most fundamental fear in the universe.
So what?
Why? Was he an idiot?
So, an idiot then.
Can you just hurry up, please, or I'll hit you with my shoe.
Fakery. All of it. It's a con, it's a racket!
Never mind about beeping. Who cares about beeping?The dead are dead. 'They're not talking to you out of your television sets.They're just gone
And all these poor souls down there in these tanks,I'm sorry, but they're just dead and they're not coming back.
This isn't possible. The dead don't come back.
If they scanned you telepathically, they could've lifted a voice print. It could still be a fake.
Question him. Ask him questions only he'd know the answer to. Be sure. You, with me.
I've got to check out those tanks. There's something that I'm missing.
Sceptical and critical, remember? Be strong, even if it breaks your heart.
Who would harvest dead bodies? I feel like I'm missing something obvious.
And all your dead people are standing. Don't you think you skipped the headline?
Doctor Chang, your welcome droid has developed a fault.
Cybermen!
They're Cybermen, all of them. We've got to stop them getting out.
That's a matrix data-slice. A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord technology.
How did you get hold of Time Lord technology? Who are you?
Two hearts.
You're a Time Lord.
Which Time Lady?
Clara. Clara. Clara. I've got to get Clara!
I presume you have stairs.
Get away from here! All of you, run!
Go! Go! Get away from here! Run away! Run, run! Get away from here all of you, now!
Get away, go!
Who are you?
Who's Missy?

I don't think I asked you to sit.
That's nice, but I'm married.
I don't discuss my business in public.
Who are you?
Whose messenger?
Never heard of her.
Where's the tea room?
Oh. Of course. Psychic projection. Someone's sending me a dream message. Well, I hope I fell asleep somewhere comfy.
Can't remember. How do you hang up on this thing?
Oh yeah? And what if I just wake up?
Yes.
No.
I will not say that name.
No!
Skaro.
I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me messages.
Do they? I wish they'd stop. I love your choice of meeting place.
Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state of it. Who told you about me?
Maybe not, but you're very well informed. If Hannah's in a Dalek prison camp, tell me, why aren't you?
(chuckles) No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You're very cold.
It's a trap.
You are, and you don't even know it.
How much trouble, Mister Pond?
Out of ten? Eleven.
Not just any spaceship. The Parliament of the Daleks. Be brave.
Make them remember you. Well, come on then. You've got me. What are you waiting for? At long last, it's Christmas! Here I am.
I'll what?
Well.
This is new.
Arrived where?
Do you remember who you were before they emptied you out and turned you into their puppet?
You had a daughter.
Well?
According to legend, you have a dumping ground. A planet where you lock up all the Daleks that go wrong. The battle-scarred, the insane, the ones even you can't control. It's never made any sense to me.
Because you'd just kill them.
Offensive?
I thought you'd run out of ways to make me sick. Hello again. You think hatred is beautiful.
How many Daleks are in there?
All still alive?
Er, it's me.
It's me, playing the triangle. Okay, I got buried in the mix. Carmen. Lovely show. Someone's transmitting this. Have you considered tracking back the signal and talking to them? He asked the Daleks.
Hello? Hello? Carmen
Hello?
Come in. Come in.
Come in, Carmen.
Yes, reading you loud and clear. Identify
Yourself and report your status.
Yes, confirmed. Actually, properly, real.
A year? Are you okay? Are you under attack?
Do you know what those lifeforms are?
What have you been doing on your own against the Daleks for a year?
Souffls? Against the Daleks? Where'd you get the milk?
No, it isn't.
Because a starliner has crashed into your Asylum, and someone's got in. And if someone can get in, then everything can get out. A tsunami of insane Daleks. Even you don't want that.
Then why is it still here? You've enough firepower on this ship to blast it out of the sky.
Turn it off.
A small taskforce could sneak through a forcefield. Send in a couple of Daleks. Oh. (applauds) Oh. Oh, that's good. That's brilliant. You're all too scared to go down there. Not one of you will go, so tell me, what do the Daleks do when they're too scared?
You don't have a Predator, and even if you did, why would they turn off a forcefield for you?
Me? Me?
The what? The nano what?
You're going to fire me at a planet? That's your plan? I get fired at a planet and expected to fix it.
Don't be fair to the Daleks when they're firing me at a planet.
What do you want with them?
Don't worry. We'll get through this, I promise. Don't be scared.
Ha! Oi!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Souffl girl?
How are you doing that, eh? This is Dalek technology.
No, it isn't. Where are you?
Hey! Oi! Souffl girl!
Come back!
Amy! Hey, where's Rory?
Yeah. Except she's been here a year.
Won't you introduce us to your crew?
They're dead. All of them.
You're sure about that, are you? Because I'd say they've all been dead for a very long time.
Amy, the door!
Because he wasn't wearing one of these. Oh, ho, ho. That's clever. The nanocloud. Microorganisms that automatically process any organic matter, living or dead, into a Dalek puppet. Anything attacks this place, it automatically becomes part of the on-site security.
These wristbands protect us. The only thing stopping us going exactly the way he did
Yes, exactly. Living or, or
Dead. Oh dear.
Yes.
I know.
Shut up.
Yeah, she. Oi, what is wrong with my chin?
How can you hack into everything? It should be impossible. You're in a crashed ship!
Doctor. You call me the Doctor.
Ah ha! Hatch. Looks like it's been used already and they've tried to block it off behind them.
The lower part of the pod is buried, so this must go straight down to the Asylum.
Speaking of Rory, is there anything you want to tell me?
What happened?
What can I do?
Yeah, let's go and find them. Oh, hello, hello, hello. What are they up to?
One of these. (a wristband) But where did they get it?
Oh, Amy.
The air all around is full of micro-machines. Robots the size of molecules. Nanogenes. Now that you're unprotected, you're being re-written.
Physical changes come later.
With your mind. Your feelings, your memories, and I'm sorry but it's started already.
Because we've had this conversation four times.
Hang on to scared. Scared isn't Dalek.
Keep a look out. Don't open this door. Oswin!
Oswin, can you hear me?
Why don't I have a visual on you? Why can't I ever see you?
Rory. You found Rory?
How many Daleks directly ahead of me right now?
How do I get past them? Amy!
Amy, it's the nanocloud, it's altering your perception. Look again. Look again. Those aren't people.
Amy, come out. Take my hand. Run! Run!
Er, oh yes, they are.
Run.
It's damaged.
Identify me. Access your files. Who am I? Come on. Who's your daddy?
Access your standing orders concerning the Predator.
And how are you going to do that, Dalek? Without a gun you're a tricycle with a roof. How are you going to destroy me?
It's going to blow itself up, and I with it. Only weapon it's got left.
I'm not looking for a countermand, dear. I'm looking for reverse.
Who do you think?
Amy.
Amy. Still with us.
Same old Amy.
What about you, though, Oswin. How come you're okay?
Why hasn't the nanocloud converted you?
Clever of you. Now, this place. The Daleks said it was fully automated. Look at it. It's a wreck.
A junior entertainment manager hiding out in a wrecked ship, hacking the security systems of the most advanced warrior race
The universe has ever seen. But you know what really gets me about you, Oswin? The souffls. Where do you get milk
For the souffls?
Seriously. Is no one else wondering about that?
I'm not the Predator, I'm just a man with a plan.
In no particular order, we need to neutralise all the Daleks in this Asylum, rescue Oswin from the wreckage, escape from this planet and fix Amy and Rory's marriage.
Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit.
The Asylum has a forcefield. The Daleks upstairs are waiting for me to turn it off. Soon as I do, they'll burn this whole world and us with it.
So, Oswin, my question is this. How fast can you drop the forcefield?
Because this is a teleport. Am I right, Oswin?
I can boost the power. Once the forcefield is down, I can use it to beam us right off this planet.
We'll have to be quick, yes.
The only place within range. The Dalek ship.
What's wrong with four seconds? You can do loads in four seconds. Oswin, how fast can you drop the forcefield?
No, just drop the forcefield and come to us.
Why wouldn't I?
I don't think that we have a choice. Okay, as soon as the forcefield is down the Daleks will attack. If it gets too explody-wody in here, you go without me, okay?
Oh, don't worry about me. You're the one beaming up to a Dalek ship to get exterminated.
Keep her remembering, keep her focused. That'll hold back the conversion.
You heard what she said. They're subtracting love. Don't let them.
Oswin, I think I'm close.
Okay. And the bad which I suddenly feel is coming?
What's so special about this lot, then?
All of them.
These are the Daleks who survived me.
Yeah, well
Special visitor. Okay, door, but it won't open. I can't be far away, though.
No.
Oswin, get this door open.
Oswin, open this door!
Oswin.
Just get this door open!
Oswin! Oswin, please! Get this door open! Help me!
Stop!
What, what did you do?
No, tell me what you did.
The path web, yes.
You made them forget me?
I've tried hacking into the path web. Even I couldn't do it.
Oswin, we have a problem.
Does it look real to you?
Where you are right now.
Does it seem real?
It's a dream, Oswin. You dreamed it for yourself because the truth was too terrible.
Because you are a Dalek.
You were human when you crashed here. It was you who climbed out of the pod. That was your ladder.
Not any more. Because you're right. You're a genius. And the Daleks need genius. They didn't just make you a puppet, they did a full conversion.
Oswin, I am so sorry, but you are a Dalek. The milk, Oswin. The milk and the eggs for the souffls. Where, where did it all come from?
It wasn't real. It was never real.
Oswin.
Oswin. No, no, no, Oswin. Oswin.
Listen. Oswin, you don't have to do this.
Oswin!
I fought them many, many times.
I know. I tried to stop.
What did you say?
Oswin, are you
Thank you.
Right, go! Let's go. We're good. Let's go. Oh, for God's sake.
You know, you guys should really have seen this coming. The thing about me and teleports, I've got a really good aim. Pin-point accurate, in fact. Or, to put it another way
Suckers!
It's me. You know me. The Doctor. The Oncoming Storm. The Predator.
Oh, Oswin. Oh, you did it to them all. You beauty.
Fellas, you're never going to stop asking.
Doctor who. Doctor who. Doctor Who!

And so we shall.
This is my favourite kind of jazz, straight blowing.
What's this? It's a reminder.
Well, obviously, at this precise moment it's a reminder to change course for another destination.
I've forgotten. Oh, we'll have to go back and find out.
Don't you find it embarrassing asking for autographs?
Well, I probably arranged it centuries ago.
Get down!
Couldn't see. Quick, the Tardis.
Welcome home.
Ace!
Duck.
No, duck.
Afraid not.
Yes, I know I built it for you to replace the one that was destroyed by the Daleks, but
This is more than just a tape deck. And besides, we've more to worry about than just listening to your tape.
I'm afraid there's an infinite number of possibilities. What concerns me more is my alarm. Got to find out what it was supposed to be.
I'm afraid not. Obviously the arrangements were made in rather a hurry. They are important. I've given them a terminal rating.
It means that some planet somewhere faces imminent destruction.
Quite.
That looks familiar. Earth.
I've been busy.
Well, in strictly linear terms, as the chronometer flies, I've known since November the twenty third, 1638.
Hello. Ow!
Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do, look at all this stuff. You take that aisle.
Presents.
Well, if you were a lady who travelled.
Yes, you're not always invited, but you are, you get presents, and then you need somewhere to store them.
Windsor.
This is new.
It probably is, upstairs, but we're in the vault.
I'm looking for a silver bow we want to borrow.
It's only temporary.
Listen, Ace, do I have to remind you that the safety of the world is at stake?
Precisely.
There's even less time than I thought. Please, let's hurry.
No, that was the return to Earth of a comet called Nemesis that has been in orbit for exactly three hundred and fifty years.
Wasn't difficult, really. It was me who launched it into space in the first place. This may qualify as the worst miscalculation since life crawled out of the seas on this sad planet.
The bow was in the case.
For once legend is absolutely correct. It has just returned.
Oh, now this.
I'll tell you three hundred and fifty years ago.
Shush.
There might be someone at home.
Windsor, of course. Only a few hundred yards from the Castle.
It certainly is. And furthermore, don't move.
Stay where you are.
Something you don't want to see.
A lady.
Lady Peinforte's nothing if not original. I'm afraid this poor man was employed for his useful rather than his ornamental qualities. He's a scholar. He's done remarkably well. In a matter of months since I was last here, he's calculated the exact time and date when a comet called Nemesis will land on this planet. The twenty third of November.
And Lady Peinforte's rewarded him with her usual generosity.
Hmm? Oh, no, no. Not to her. To a statue of her. She made the statue from the silver metal that fell out of the sky into that meadow out there.
Hmm, this game is going rather badly.
Don't worry. There's no one here now, apart from our late friend. Lady Peinforte's around all right, in Windsor, but three hundred and fifty years in the future.
She uses the silver arrow, of course, and she had some basic rudimentary knowledge about time travel. Black magic, mostly.
Mmm, and what you might call a nose for secrets.
Oh, dear.
Unfortunately, Lady Peinforte discovered it was something rather more unusual. A living metal. Validium.
Yes, with just one purpose. Destruction.
Later, Ace.
Dj vu?
Oh, very droll. I haven't been here since they were building the place. You remember the way around?
Quite right. What we need's a guide. Come on.
This way? What do you think?
Act as if you own the place.
It always works. We own the place.
How annoying. I can't place that woman for the life of me.
It's all right, Ace. I know that woman from somewhere.
What! Why didn't you say something?
She's just the woman we need. Quick, after her. Ah ha!
It'll be very useful to have the armed forces and the police on our side, and can you suggest a better person to ask?
There's no alternative.
I've got to speak to her.
But I am a doctor!
I could tell you, but you won't believe me.
I travelled through time and space.
Oh yes, very well, then. Let's forget about the armed forces.
Listen, the fate of every living creature on this planet hangs in the balance.
You will believe me. You will let us go. You will not move. (to Ace) You will move.
It's easy once you know how. You have to make a spectacle of yourself.
Only trouble is, it doesn't last long.
Oh look, a Van Dyck.
Back to the Tardis. We're obviously not going to get any help here.
What? Gosh, so it is. My goodness, what a good likeness.
Well, it hasn't happened yet.
I know. We haven't done it. That's why you don't remember it.
Well, it did to Louis Armstrong, but then he really understood time.
I only hope we're not to late.
Er, don't be afraid. We won't harm you.
Fortunately, I haven't seen it since 1638, when it disappeared along with the good Lady Peinforte.
She really doesn't. Allow me to explain, Ace.
For the validium to become active, it must have a sufficient quantity of critical mass. The statue alone is no good without the bow.
And the arrow. Now, if someone could put the bow and arrow into the statue's hands
I simply notice what is obvious. You, apparently, don't.
You see those policemen there? They've been attacked by technology more advanced and more terrible than you could imagine.
And you might also have observed the electricity supply being drained over the last few days.
Yes.
I'm glad to say I can't.
Don't move!
Don't thank them yet. We might live to regret it.
Cybermen.
Take cover.
We certainly can. This exactly the same thing that happened the last time. Only then it was the Roundheads and Lady Peinforte.
Where did that come from?
A Cyberman killed with an arrow? But that's ludicrous, unless. Of course, the head's made of gold.
Yes. The only substance to which they're vulnerable.
Ah! Gold dipped in poison. Lady Peinforte's calling card.
I really think you're right.
We're just passing through, Ace.
Yes. Someone's moved the chess pieces.
Voila!
Our friend the mathematician was a genius, but he needed a little help to get started.
Cold?
Yes.
Validium was created as the ultimate defence for Gallifrey, back in early times.
Yes.
Rassilon.
And none of it should have left Gallifrey. But, as always with these things, some of it did.
Or anyone else.
Yes, so I launched the largest piece into space.
Look. We're almost there.
Well, the Cybermen might find the Tardis. This way, our validium leads us to their validium.
I'm an old-fashioned guy.
That. Cybermen communicating.
You should see the ones they're communicating with.
Yes. But if we could only jam their signal. Have you got a tape?
Of course it does. I built it.
Are we having fun?
Oh, I do love a jam session.
This is ridiculous. Who did this to you?
Just in time.
I don't suppose you've completely ignored my instructions and secretly prepared any Nitro Nine, have you?
Naturally you wouldn't do anything so insanely dangerous as to carry it around with you, would you?
Excellent. Blow up that vehicle.
Hello, I'm the Doctor! I believe you want to kill me.
They were dead already. The Cybermen had transformed them. They were no longer human beings.
Probably. They were like people themselves before they turned themselves into Cybermen. Quite a lot of human beings are trying to follow their example.
Are we still jamming them?
Good. Let's see who's listening to it.
Ah, sweet.
Anything there?
That handful back there aren't the only Cybermen in the universe. We've got to find out where the others are.
Right.
Then the scanner's wrong. That lot were only the advance party. Out there somewhere's the entire Cyberforce, and they want the Nemesis more than anything else in space.
Because it's 1988.
Listen, Ace. The Nemesis generates destruction. It affects everything around it. I launched it into space, but unfortunately with an orbit that brings it back to Earth every twenty five years. Take the twentieth century. It appeared in 1913.
Twenty five years later?
Hitler annexes Austria.
Kennedy assassinated.
Check the scanner again.
Of course. It's so simple. They're shrouded.
Shrouded. They don't show up. But we must try and force them into revealing themselves. Treble. Bass. Please let me be right. Is anyone listening? Balance.
Cyber warships. Thousands of them. They were invisible.
I think our best move is to go to the crypt, unarmed, with the bow.
We've got to get the bow into the statue's hands in order to activate the validium.
I believe in the direct approach. You can always go back to the Tardis.
Ace?
Oh, Ace. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Why don't you go back to the Tardis? You'll be safe there, whatever happens.
Good afternoon.
Yes, here we are. I'm sorry we couldn't have been here earlier, but we were held up on the way. I don't believe you've met my friend Ace.
Cyberleader moves pawn to discover check.
Doctor en passant behind Cyberleader.
Doctor supports combination gambit.
Middle game element with Cybermen.
End game. Illegal move, but checkmate!
That seems to be in order.
Run!
The Tardis.
Now it's awake, it'll follow the bow.
Unfinished business. We don't want those to fall into the wrong hands, just yet.
Black's losing.
Bishop takes rook. Someone steals them.
How should I know, Ace? Questions, questions. Queen takes bishop.
But pawn takes queen.
Checkmate. Black wins. Time to go. Take those gold coins. We may need them.
Ah. Now, the statue should be here any moment now. Everything depends on my final calculations. I can't get my figures wrong this time.
You are interrupting me.
There's also another slight problem. The Cybermen could be here at any moment.
Aim at the chest panel. And I trust you remember my strict instructions never to cause any further explosions?
Good. We're ready for anything.
Now, ah yes, the bow. The bow. The bow is essential. You shall have the bow.
And now, we'll set the rockets for the correct projection, and then you will be on course for the Cyberfleet.
The rockets are now locked in to a destination. Now, let's see how the Cyberfleet is progressing.
Right on course.
Forever.
Reform.
I hope not.
Enough.
Not yet.
I told you when.
Things are still imperfect.
Stop! Harm her in the slightest, and I will destroy this bow!
No.
Ah.
Well, actually, I would have arranged to have the bow neatly placed in front of the rocket sled. Then I would have arranged the rockets to test fire at a pre-arranged time. By the way, Ace, what is the time?
Not to the likes of you.
If I give you the bow
It's all over, Ace. My battle, all my battles, I've lost. I can only surrender.
But not to you. The Cybermen will have the Nemesis.
Very well, tell them.
Be my guest.
Exactly. Thank you for coming to the twentieth century and giving me assistance. Thank you for bringing the arrow. You may go now.
You had the right game, but the wrong pawn. Check.
Thank you.
Do you understand the Cyberleader's instructions?
Stand back. She's ready for launching.
Certainly.
Yes, I gave your instructions to the Nemesis, and it understood them. It understood them, and disobeyed them, and destroyed the Cyberfleet.
It's worth it.
That seems to be that. Thank you.
I know how you feel. However
Back to 1638?
Anything's possible.
I suppose I did. How clever of me.
As I said, Ace. Unfinished business.

(reading) New York growled at my window, but I was ready for it. My stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and I was packing cleavage that could fell an ox at twenty feet.
I'm reading!
There's something different about you, isn't there?
Melody Malone. She's a private detective in old town New York.
Oh, you've read it?
I'm just reading it. I just like the cover.
No, no, I'm busy. It's your hair! Is it your hair?
I don't like them. They make your eyes look all liney. No, actually, sorry. They're fine. Carry on.
Yes.
Oh, do you know, it is so humiliating when you do that.
Can I have a go?
DOCTOR; Oh, actually, that is much better. That is exciting.
I thought you didn't like my reading aloud.
I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings.
(reads) As I crossed the street, I saw the thin guy, but he didn't see me. I guess that's how it began.
(reads) I followed the skinny guy for two more blocks before he turned and I could ask exactly what he was doing here. He looked a little scared, so I gave him my best smile and my bluest eyes.
He said, 'I just went to get coffees for the Doctor and Amy. Hello, River.'
He went to get coffee. Pay attention.
DOCTOR; I don't know. We're in New York!
It was in my jacket.
How does anything get there. I've given up asking. Date, date. Does she mention a date? When is this happening?
Couldn't have? What does she mean? Couldn't have?
Even who couldn't do it?
1938. Easy one.
1938. We just bounced off it.
It makes sense.
That's what happened to Rory. That's what the Angels do. It's their preferred form of attack. They zap you back in time, let you live to death.
Well, tried that, if you've noticed, and we are back where we started in 2012.
Don't know. Probably causally linked somehow. Doesn't matter. Extractor fans on!
Doing what?
I'm what?
Stop! No! No! Stop! You can't read ahead. You mustn't. And you can't do that.
Just the stuff that's happening now, in parallel with us. That's as far as we go.
And if you read ahead and find that Rory dies? This isn't any old future, Amy, it's ours. Once we know what's coming, it's fixed. 0 I'm going to break something, because you told me that I'm going to do it. No choice now.
Not once you've read it. Once we know what's coming, it's written in stone.
Okay, landing a plane in a timey wimey blizzard. I could push through, but if I'm out by a nanosecond, the engines will phase and I'll shatter the planet. I need landing lights.
Yes, I need a signal to lock on to. What did she say? Early what dynasty?
Ah, hello, yes.
Special commission from the Emperor.
Landing lights. We have a signal. Locking on.
Just a moment. Final checks.
Sorry I'm late, honey. Traffic was hell. Shock. He'll be fine.
So where are we now, Doctor Song? How's prison?
Pardoned?
You said I got too big.
Weren't you the woman who killed the Doctor?
She's holding you very tight.
I doubt she's strong enough.
Because Amy read it in a book, and now I have no choice.
You see?
Your book. Which you haven't written yet, so we can't read.
What, a page of handy hints, previews, spoiler free?
He's in the cellar.
No! Get your wrist out. You get your wrist out without breaking it!
I don't know. Just do it. Change the future!
No! They're Angels. Baby Angels.
Yes, I think so, yes.
You got out.
Well, come on, come on, come on, where is he?
How did you get your wrist out without breaking it?
You just changed the future.
She's good, have you noticed? Really, really good.
Show me!
DOCTOR; Okay, when all those numbers on both units go to zero, that's when we've got a lock, okay? It's how we find Rory.
Why did you lie to me?
It must hurt. Come here.
There you go. How's that?
River
River!
There you are.
Got it. He's at a place called Winter Quay. The car, yes? Let's go.
We'll know that when we know what this place is.
Amy. Rory!
Get out of here! Don't look at anything. Don't touch
I'm sorry, Rory, but you just died.
This place is policed by Angels. Every time you try to escape, you get zapped back in time.
DOCTOR; Displacing someone back in time creates time energy, and that is what the Angels feed on. But normally, it's a one off, a hit and run. If they could keep hold of their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again. This place is a farm. A battery farm. How many Angels in New York?
The Angels take Manhattan because they can, because they've never had a food source like this one. The city that never sleeps. (Slow heavy footsteps outside the window.)
I don't know. But I think they're coming for you.
The Angels will come for you. They'll zap you back in time to this very spot, thirty, forty years ago. And you'll live out the rest of your life in this room, until you die in that bed.
No.
Because he was so pleased to see you again.
DOCTOR; It's already happened. Rory, you've just witnessed your own future.
No, he isn't.
It would be almost impossible.
But to create a paradox like that takes almost unimaginable power. What have we got, eh? Tell me. Come on, what?
Rory, even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for the rest of your life. They would be chasing you for ever.
River, I'm not sure this can work.
We can't keep doing this.
Yeah, the usual. Run!
Okay! Fire escape.
What the hell are you doing!
Amy! Amy!
The paradox. It's working! The paradox is working!
Back where we started. You collapsed the timeline. The paradox worked. We all pinged back where we belong.
Does it matter? We got lucky. We could've blown New York off the planet. I can't ever take the Tardis back there. The timelines are too scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again.
I was talking to myself.
I've been busy.
I just changed it.
Yes. I know, I know.
Ha!
I want go to the pub right now. Are there video games there? I love video games.
It's a survivor. Very weak, but keep your eyes on it.
I'm sorry. Amelia, I'm so, so sorry.
Would rip New York apart.
Amy, what are you doing?
What are you talking about? Back away from the Angel. Come back to the Tardis. We'll figure something out.
I don't know. Nobody knows.
No!
Amy.
No!
Stop it. Just, just stop it!
You are creating fixed time. I will never be able to see you again.
Amy, please, just come back into the Tardis. Come along, Pond, please.
No!
River, they were your parents. I'm sorry, I didn't think.
Of course it matters.
Travel with me, then.
Yes. Yes.
The last page!
I know. You both have lives here. Beautiful, messy lives. That is what makes you so fabulously human. You don't want to give them up. I understand.
You could come, Brian.

Hmm?
Really?
Not so far, no.
That's intensely interesting. Do you realise there's nowhere to go?
We're on the edge of the cosmos, the frontiers of creation, the boundary between what is and isn't, or isn't yet, anyway. Don't you think that's interesting?
What? I feel just like a goldfish looking out on a new world.
Yes.
Nothing?
Nothing? It's magnificent. Any minute, any second, a whole new world could be born and we'd be the first
Shush. We'd be the first intelligent and semi-intelligent beings to witness the spectacle.
What's he saying?
Shush, shush. Where, K9, where?
Thirty four seven? That's beyond visual aid range.
Listen, Leela. Listen! Ion drive, or I'm a budgie's cousin.
Shut up, K9. Shut up.
I can tell him to shut up if I want to.
What?
Leela.
That's a spiral nebula. A gas cloud coalescing to form a whole new star system. It's sucking in everything around it like a gigantic whirlpool, including us.
No, it's bad. Very bad.
Time to get out of here. K9, escape coordinates.
Yes. Yes!
Hmm.
No.
Made in Minyos. Made in Minyos? Got it! The Minyans of Minyos. This could be a Minyan patrol vessel. Have you ever heard of the Flying Dutchman?
Pity, I've often wanted to know who he was. K9, could you give me a date on that, do you think?
Yes, that's what I thought.
That's a hundred thousand years old. The Minyan civilisation was destroyed a hundred thousand years ago, on the other side of the universe.
It was what happened on Minyos that led to our policy of non-intervention.
Yeah. Well, the Minyans thought of us as gods, you see, which was all very flattering and we were new at space-time explorations, so we thought we could help. We gave them medical and scientific aid, better communications, better weapons.
Kicked up out at gunpoint. Then they went to war with each other, learnt how to split the atom, discovered the toothbrush and finally split the planet.
Yes.
You all right, K9?
Trouble.
Blast the door, K9.
It's a Liebermann laser. Fires charged particles along a laser beam. Don't ever play with strange weapons, Leela.
And switch the safety catch off.
Shush.
Shush.
Anything I can do? How do you do?
I'm the Doctor.
Hmm? Well, through the door.
Yes, if I can, yes.
Yes, I'm a Time Lord.
That's all right. What happened to her?
Well, if you know what to do, why don't you do it?
Yes?
Yes.
So you did develop the pacifier.
How long does the effect last?
Oh, very, very.
Really.
Yes.
Oh, many things, many things.
My dear chap, what's the problem?
How much time have we got?
Mind if I take a look?
Well, I've been through it two or three times. Not pleasant.
It's had it, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry.
Tell me about this Quest.
But surely after all this time there won't be any survivors.
So?
Ah. Does the P7E have regeneration too?
A race bank. Hmm.
Hmm. Well, it seems a pity to give up now, after all you've been through. Do you know, there just might be the ghost of a chance, if it's at all compatible.
You'll see. K9? Where are you, boy? Come on, heel! K9!
He's my second best friend, aren't you, K9?
Try this.
Here, K9, feel anything?
Right. From now on, you're in charge. K9, we want to avoid the nebula. It's all yours, K9. You're on. What?
Well done, K9. What?
Leela.
Leela! Leela, listen to me. You're primitive. Wild, warlike, aggressive and tempestuous, and bad tempered too.
Yes. You're a warrior leader from a warrior tribe. Courageous, indomitable, implacable, impossible
Oh, put it away. You were pacified.
Pacified.
It's all right, Leela.
No.
Listen, Jackson. Listen.
Jackson, two four zero takes us right back into the nebula.
But that could mean destruction.
But P7E didn't go in there. She couldn't have! She must have been there at the beginning and the nebula formed around her.
It's elementary physics. The still centre of a raging storm. P7E might be in there and she might be safe, but if you go in after her, it could mean destruction.
Jackson, I can't allow that.
What? K9, stop.
We're going on, K9.
Jackson, listen to me. This is hopeless.
We're being sucked through a layer of meteorites. They're smashing us to pieces.
I said they're smashing us to piece
Don't you know? What's the normal hull thickness?
K9! Present hull thickness?
We're being turned into a planet.
No, it's not impossible, Jackson. It's simply gravity. This ship's a large, heavy object surrounded by smaller, lighter, objects. Our gravitational pull is greater than theirs. We attract them. They stick to us. It all snowballs.
We're being buried alive. If it wasn't for this layer of debris, the asteroid belt would have smashed us to pieces. Still, you can't have everything, can you.
I don't know. You could try the laser cannon.
Mmm.
Carry on, Herrick.
Carry on, Herrick.
Herrick, keep on!
That's the P7E.
That's where the signal's coming from.
Right in the middle. The planet formed around it.
Full speed!
Hold tight.
You can relax now. Relax, everyone. It's a soft planet in the process of formation. Only the core will be solid and with any luck this stuff should slow us down so we don't hit it with too much of a bang.
Fascinating. The Quest and nothing but the Quest.
Well, Jackson?
Solid rock?
Igneous hematite? That means we're at the core.
Well, old ones like Earth, yes, but new ones have a molten slurry round a solid core. All we have to do is burrow our way out of here and enter the core.
I don't know about that. What about a shield gun?
Herrick!
Give it a blast. Hold it. Like that, I think.
Get on with it, Jackson.
The Quest is the Quest.
Of course.
Welcome to the underworld.
Of course.
Oh, he'll be all right. He's building up his strength.
Hmm, radiation.
Not at all. Igneous rock core, new planet, bound to be radiation. Luck? Physics isn't luck, physics is fact. Are facts. Is fact. Anyway, why do you think these tunnels were dug out?
Exactly. Energy. Can't survive on a new planet with a soul full of hope and fresh air, you know.
Shush. Shall we go?
Did I ever tell you about the time I went to Aberdeen?
That's right. Did you know, the people there absorb more radiation from the granite than people who work every day in nuclear power plants.
Well, of course it is. It shows that organisms can adapt to any kind of environment, even one like this with a high radiation count.
I don't know. I'll ask him.
Quick, in here.
Fumigation? I don't like the sound of that. They're going to smoke us out like badgers. Come on.
No, no! Don't, don't, don't. Get off him, Leela. You're terrifying the poor fellow.
He's wounded. It's all right, we're friends. She won't hurt you.
Leela.
Really?
I don't know. Fetch me a tissue, Leela, from the command deck.
What's your name?
Idas? Hello, Idas.
Are you frightened?
Well, that shouldn't take much fixing.
What? Oh, Leela. Thank you.
This is the one. Go back and unplug K9.
Yes. Linked up like that, he's recharging the whole ship. I'll need him soon. The ship can look after itself.
Sting, did it? That's good. Now, what was it you wanted to know? Hmm?
No, no, I'm just a traveller.
The sky.
What?
The stars, then?
Yes, Idas. This ship comes from the stars.
Well, no, but could you take me to your father? Why not?
We'll see about that. Come on, get up.
His name's Idas.
Get him to the command deck. He'll be all right there.
Out.
Get him to the command deck!
Whatever blows can be sucked.
I wonder where it all went?
Shush.
Hmm?
What? Good.
Hmm.
Yes.
But we've got problems with the ship.
You do?
Where is it?
Could you take us there?
Why not?
No time? Don't say that to me, I'm a Time Lord. Come on!
I see. The Oracle tells the Seers.
Ah.
Shush, shush.
Yes, good. Idas, K9 has made us a map of the tunnel. K9, find Jackson, bring him back here then follow us. Off you go.
Recognise that?
The Tree at the End of the World. Where are we?
Where's your father? I see. Can we get from there to there quickly?
Why not?
Why?
So do I, Idas. So do I. The Tree at the End of the World's always guarded by dragons. They're fire dragons, aren't they, with tongues of flame.
Really? We'll see if they're at home, shall we? Here, try that.
No, throw it, don't eat it.
See the source?
Got it with that one?
Give it a blast.
Now the door.
Phew.
In you go.
Yes, there is.
Yes, there is. Gravity.
Towards the centre. This is the centre. Centre of the planet. Zero gravity, as in space. Watch.
Just push.
DOCTOR Push.
Ready?
And push.
And push.
You all right, Idas?
Intimidation. The more ritual and mumbo-jumbo, the greater deterrent. That's the whole point of official sadism.
Throw it down.
Into the tunnels! You'll never beat them here!
Into the tunnels.
Did I ever tell you about the time I went to Blackpool, hmm? If they process rock, they must take it in somewhere. Into the ship, the P7E, mustn't they?
Crushers. Yes. Yes, there must be another way. Tell me, why do you think Idas calls the tunnel system the Tree?
The Tree of Life. The race bank. The gift of immortality on the Tree of Life guarded by the dragon.
Yes.
Ah, myths often have a grain of truth in them, if you know where to look. Everybody here, except us, comes from the same stock as Jackson and company.
Yes. How else do you think they got here on the middle of a new planet?
They're the descendents of the people who came on the P7E. Jackson's probably Idas' great-great-great-great-great-great- grandfather a few times back.
Yes. Don't worry about it.
There is another way into the Citadel, you know.
But not the goods entrance. They still need fuel, don't they? And they need food and they need rock, and the rock has to be crushed somewhere. Isn't that wonderful? Bring that sword.
What do you think, Jackson?
Well, it's not my plan exactly, but it has worked before. A fellow called Ulysses pulled it off a little while ago.
Quickly now. Stay calm. Everybody stay quite calm. Calm. K9, back to the ship. Check all the systems. We're leaving in a hurry.
There must be another way back to the Oracle. Jackson? Jackson, can you and the crew hold them off?
Good. Leela?
You come with me.
You'll come with me. Idas, you too. Have you got a sword?
Jackson. Right, Jackson.
This way.
What?
What?
Where does that lead?
Yes, it certainly seems like it.
I don't know.
Let's take a look.
Stay here.
The cylinders. The race bank of the Minyans.
Well, that's what I'm asking.
Well, who do I have to be to dare question your word? I'll give you a clue, shall I? If it wasn't for my people, you wouldn't have seen the light of day.
The ones the Minyans call the gods.
Well, yes, here you are, yes, but nowhere else. You're just another machine with megalomania. Another insane object, another self-aggrandising artefact. You're nothing. Nothing but a mass of superheated junk with delusions of grandeur.
What did you say?
Ah ha! Then you've still got them.
Keeper? You're nothing but a box, and I've got the key. (to Idas) Give me that.
Almost there.
No hard feelings.
They know this place better than we do.
I'm just wondering what they've given Jackson.
No. They'll come and dig us out.
Well, whoever it was buried us.
Because we've got something it wants. The Oracle, remember?
What kept you, K9?
Stop!
Here are your race banks.
That's what I intend to find out.
K9, what do you make of these?
What?
Two thousand megatons?
I don't know.
I think I'd better get rid of them, don't you?
Excuse me, I'm a stranger here myself. Could you direct me to the Oracle?
What, those? I wouldn't if I were you. They won't do you any
You're making a terrible mistake. Those are the wrong ones.
Ah, well, er.
Look, getting rid of me isn't going to solve anything. Those cylinders were bombs. Why don't we just wait a few minutes and then we can all go together, hmm?
Yes, yes, I think so. Come on, let's get out of here. We've got no time. Tell them they've got no time.
Quiet! Quiet, everyone. Come on, here.
Now listen to me. I want you to stay calm, and when I say, go quickly but quietly. Ready? Take this little one. Off you go now. Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on. Plenty of room for everyone. Everything's going to be all right. All right, all right.
What are you doing? Never mind that!
No! Come on.
This planet's going to explode.
Why?
Why?
Listen, Jackson. This is your people. This is your race. Descendents of the people who came on the P7E.
Look this planet is going to explode, Jackson. Your only hope is to go, and go now. Go, Jackson, go!
Right. Sit down, everybody. Sit down. Now, stay very calm.
Get down. Right down, right down.
Everything all right, Jackson?
Oh, come on, Jackson, be brave. Sit down.
There she goes. If you wanted power, Jackson, get ready to ride out the blast.
Yes?
No, no, no time. I'm very busy. Goodbye, Jason.
Hmm?
Who?
What? I called Jackson Jason?
No, Jackson isn't Jason.
No, no, no. Jason was another captain on a long quest.
Ah. He was looking for the Golden Fleece.
Yes, yes. He found it hanging on a tree at the end of the world. Perhaps those myths are not just old stories of the past, you see, but prophecies of the future. Who know? What do you think, K9?
What did he say?
Negative? Can he paint? Hmm? Negative.

Invasion of the very small cubes. That's new.
All absolutely identical. Not a single molecule's difference between them. No blemishes, imperfections, individualities.
Very thorough, Brian. Very, very thorough. Well done. Stay here. Watch these. Yell if anything happens.
I don't know. And I really don't like not knowing.
Right, I need to use your kitchen as a lab. Cook up some cubes. See what happens.
What? You've got a job?
I imagined mostly kissing.
All the Ponds, with their house and their jobs and their everyday lives. The journalist and the nurse. Long way from Leadworth.
Look at you now. All grown up.
Tell me, since when did science run the military, Kate?
What do we know about these cubes?
That's impressive. I don't want them to be impressive. I want them vulnerable with a nice Achilles heel.
And all around the world, people are picking them up and taking them home.
Twitter?
We need evidence. The cubes arrived in plain sight, in vast quantities, as the sun rose. So, what does that tell us?
Or more than that, they want to be observed. So we observe them. Stay with them round the clock. Watch the cubes, day and night. Record absolutely everything about them. Team cube, in it together.
Four days. Nothing! Nothing! Not a single change in any cube anywhere in the world. Four days, and I am still in your lounge!
Yes, well, I thought they'd do something, didn't I? Not just sit there while everyone eats endless cereal!
Yes, you! You, not me! I hate being patient. Patience is for wimps. I can't live like this. Don't make me. I need to be busy.
(keeping the football off the ground.) Ninety eight, ninety nine, one hundred. Amy!
Four million nine hundred ninety nine, five million.
That's better. Nothing like a bit of activity to pass the time. How long was I gone?
I can't do it. No.
Brian, you're still here.
Four days ago.
Yes, of course I can. Quick jaunt, restore sanity. Ooo, hey, come if you like.
Can't they? Can't you? That's how it goes, isn't it?
Oh yes, Rory. The universe is awaiting, but you have a little job to.
I never said it was.
All right. Fine. I'll be back soon. Monitor the cubes. Call me. I'll have the Tardis set to every Earth news feed.
I know! Happy anniversary! Come with me. And bring your husband.
26th of June, 1890. The recently opened Savoy Hotel. Dinner, bed and breakfast for two. Bonjour, bonjour. Merci, Auguste. You'll be back before the party's over. They won't even notice you went. No complications, I promise.
Ooo!
Bit of a shock, Zygon ship under the Savoy, half the staff impostors. Still, it's all fixed now, eh?
You can't miss a good wedding. Under the bed. Under the bed!
Shush!
Sorry.
I don't know what you're talking about, Brian.
Seven weeks. I got side-tracked. A lot.
Some left me. Some got left behind. And some, not many but, some died. Not them. Not them, Brian. Never them.
Can I stay here, with you and Rory, for a bit. Keep an eye on the cubes. However long that takes.
No, no, no. I mean, I'll be better at it this time. I miss you.
If I had a restaurant, this'd be all I'd serve.
I've run restaurants. Who do you think invented the Yorkshire pudding?
Pudding, yet savoury. Sound familiar?
Oh, yes! Second set, Doctor! Ha ha! Oh, if Fred Perry could see me now, eh? He'd probably ask for his shorts back.
Third set decider, come on, then.
Out of the way, dear, I'm trying to. Whatever you are, this planet, these people, are precious to me. And I will defend them to my last breath. Is that all you can do, hover? I had a metal dog could do that.
What's that?
Ooo, you really have woken up.
Ha! Really? Mine fired laser bolts and now it's surfing the net.
We're wanted at the Tower of London.
Now we're in business. You sent me a message to my psychic paper. You know what? I'm almost impressed.
Oh dear. Systems breach at the Pentagon, China, every African nation, the Middle East.
Don't despair, Kate. Your dad never did. Kate Stewart, heading up UNIT, changing the way they work. How could you not be? Why did you drop Lethbridge?
We don't let him down. We don't let this planet down.
Not dead. Dormant, maybe.
I don't know. I don't know. I need to think. I need some air. Who has an underground base? Terrible ventilation.
The moment they arrived, I should have made sure they were collected and burned. That is what I should have done.
You're thinking of stopping, aren't you? You and Rory.
But you're considering it.
Why?
That's not what it is.
I'm not running away. But this is one corner of one country in one continent on one planet that's a corner of a galaxy that's a corner of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond. And there is so much, so much to see, Amy. Because it goes so fast. I'm not running away from things, I am running to them before they flare and fade forever. And it's all right. Our lives won't run the same. They can't. One day, soon maybe, you'll stop. I've known for a while.
Because you were the first. The first face this face saw. And you're seared onto my hearts, Amelia Pond. You always will be. I'm running to you, and Rory, before you fade from me.
Yeah, you do, Pond, and you always get what you want. They got what they wanted.
The cubes. That's why they stopped. Come on.
Kate? Before they shut down, they scanned everything, from your medical limits to your military response patterns. They made a complete assessment of Planet Earth and its inhabitants. That's what the surge of activity was.
Problem with the power?
Hmm.
What?
Seven. Seven, what's important about seven? Seven wonders of the world, seven streams of the River Ota, seven sides of a cube.
Not if you count the inside.
It has to be a countdown.
Why would it be minutes? Kate, we have to get humanity away from those cubes. God knows what they'll do if they hit zero. Get the information out any way you can. News channels, websites, radio, text messages. People have to know that the cubes are dangerous.
Because they're clever. Allow people enough time to collect them, take them into their homes, their lives. Humans, the great early adopters. And then, wham! Profile every inch of Earth's existence.
Get that information out any way you can. Go!
Every cube was activated. There must be signals, energy fluctuations on a colossal scale, there must be some trace. There can't not be. We need to think of all the variables, all the possibilities, okay? Go, go, go, go, go!
Remotely isn't my style. See you after.
Geronimo.
There is nothing in here.
Why? Why is there nothing inside? Why? It doesn't make any sense.
Glasses, is it the same? Is it the same all around the world?
Ah, no, no, no, we are very far from safe. All along, every action has been deliberate. Why draw attention to the cubes if they don't contain anything?
What? They can't be dying. How? How are they dying?
The cubes brought people close together. They opened and then argh!
Argh. Ah, I don't know!
That's it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Only one heart. Other one's not working.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Just a short circuit. Turn around, turn around. Tell me, show me. Ten seconds after the cubes opened, show me the patterns in their electrical currents.
See?
Yes, the power cut. They zapped the power and then argh! They're signal boxes. People leaning in, wham. Pure electrical surge out of the cube targeted at the nearest human heart. The heart, an organ powered by electrical currents, short-circuited. How to destroy a human? Go for the heart. Ow. Crikey Moses.
And look at them all, pulsing bold as brass. Seven of them, all across the world. Ow! Seven stations, seven minutes. Why is that important? Argh! Ow, ow. How do you people manage? One heart, it is pitiful. A wormhole, bridging two dimensions. Seven of them hitched onto this planet, but where's the closest one? Glasses, zoom in.
How many deaths have been recorded?
Kate, I have to find the wormhole, but the attacks could still happen. Tell the world. Tell them how to deal with this. The world needs your leadership right now.
Of course you will. Good luck, Kate. Argh! Argh!
Not much longer. I need to locate the wormhole portal.
Hello. Hello!
You are giving off some very strange signals.
Outlier droid, monitoring everything. If I shut her down, I can.
Ah. It's all right, it's all right. I can't, Amy. I can't do it. I need both hearts!
What? No. No, no, no. That won't work. I'm a Time Lord.
Whoo! Ooo. Ooo! Welcome back, lefty! Whoa-ho! Two hearts! Woo! Back in the game. Ah. Never do that to me again.
The energy signals converge here. Does seem a bit cramped, though.
Through the looking glass, Amelia?
We're in orbit. One dimension to the left.
Ah. Soborian smelling salts. Outlawed in seven galaxies.
Whoa! Whoa! What kind of a welcome do you call that? Get them out of here. You too. Now!
Absolutely no idea. Get him to the portal.
Whoa!
It's not possible. I thought the Shakri were a myth. A myth to keep the young of Gallifrey in their place.
The Shakri craft, connected to Earth, through seven portals and seven minutes. Ah, but why?
Why the cubes? Why Earth?
Erase humanity before it colonises space. We thought the cubes were an invasion. The start of war.
Oi! Didn't I tell you two to go?
Some people call it Judgment Day, or the Reckoning.
I've never wanted to find out.
The pest controllers of the universe, that's how the tales went, isn't it?
You can talk. Wolf in your grandmother's nightdress? So, here you are, depositing slug pellets all over the Earth, made attractive so humans will collect them, hoping to find something beautiful inside. Because that's what they are. Not pests or plague, creatures of hope, forever building and reaching. Making mistakes, of course, every life form does. But, but they learn. And they strive for greater, and they achieve it. You want a tally. Put their achievements against their failings through the whole of time, I will back humanity against the Shakri every time.
It's going to release more cubes to kill more people.
He was never really here. Just the ship's automated interface, like a talking propaganda poster. I can stop the second wave. I can disconnect all the Shakri craft from their portals, leave them drifting in the darkspace. Ah, but all those people who were near the cubes, so many of them will have died.
Of course. Ah, beautiful. But, Ponds, Ponds. We are going to go one better than that. The Shakri used the cubes to turn people's hearts off. Bingo! We're going to use them to turn them back on again.
Well, creatures of hope. Has to.
Thirty seconds. Don't let me down, cubes, you're working for me now. Oh dear. All these cubes. There's going to be a terrible wave of energy ricocheting around here any second. Run.
My! A kiss from a Lethbridge Stewart. That is new. Oh dear, I'm late for dinner.
Dear me. I'd better get going. Things to do, worlds to save, swings to swing on. Look, I know, you both have lives here. Beautiful, messy lives. That is what makes you so fabulously human. You don't want to give them up. I understand.
You could come, Brian.

Scatter.
Jamie, come over here with me. Come on.
Polly! Over here!
Get your breath, Polly, and tell us exactly what happened.
The murderer, did he see you?
Could you find this hangar again?
We haven't seen him. Come on, let's find this hangar.
Is it locked? Is anyone in there? No, its locked. There's nobody there.
Polly, this man that killed him. Would you recognise him again?
Polly, how do you say he was killed?
Can you describe it to me?
This man was electrocuted. His clothes are all scorched!
Maybe. But not one that's not been developed yet on this planet.
We must report this to the authorities.
What, the policeman? Oh, no, no, Jamie. We must find the man in charge in this place.
There's nothing else we can do. Now, let's find the main airport building. Come on.
This seems to be leading to the main airport building.
It's locked Jamie. There's nobody there.
I'm afraid we're wasting our time here, Jamie. The sooner we find the authorities and tell it all to them, the better. Come on.
This seems to be the way, Jamie.
Excuse me, we're looking for someone in authority.
I've got no time for that. We want to see someone in authority!
You don't understand. We have something important to report.
Some sort of official mumbo-jumbo. Look! We've just discovered a dead body out there. Did you hear me?
Then please tell me where we can find them.
And where is that?
Thank you. Thank you very much. Come on, Jamie.
We neither of us have passports! Now does that satisfy you?
What aircraft?
I really think that our mode of conveyance is irrelevant. The important thing is that we've discovered a dead body out there and we want to report it to someone in authority.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yes, she saw the man killed.
Oh, what does it matter what sort of gun. The point is he was killed and my friend saw it happen.
You wouldn't think it a joke if you'd come and see the body.
Oh look, we're all wasting time. Now, are you going to come and see that body, or am I going to find someone who really is in charge in this place?
Well thank you. Thank you very much. At last.
Well, let's see what we have got, shall we?
For the police, of course. The trouble is, I can't tell them who he was.
Yes, as a matter of fact he was. There was nothing in his pockets to identify him.
Yes, I was rather surprised myself. No, wait a minute, there was one thing.
This.
Ah, but it's Spanish and it hasn't been used.
Exactly. Hello, this is interesting.
It's burnt fibres.
You're right, Jamie. That's quite new. Well, it's good to see someone is using their intelligence.
That was definitely made by a ray gun.
Unused foreign stamps.
You know what they've done with it, don't you?
The body. Somewhere there's a large packing case.
Well, I'm glad I've roused your interest.
Come on, Jamie. We'd better humour him.
If you'd had let me search the place properly we might have found
Commandant, this is the girl I was telling you about.
Now where have you been, Polly?
Would you mind telling us your name?
You have a passport?
Where did you learn such excellent English?
Ah, you're going to tell him about the dead body. Very sensible.
(sotto) Jamie, I don't think we're very welcome here. When I say run, we run.
Run!
Yes. We'll have to keep out of their way until we can prove our story.
I don't think Polly was kidding on. In fact I don't think that was Polly.
You don't want to believe everything you see, Jamie.
Jamie, what was the name of that hangar?
Yes, Chameleon Tours. An advertisement for Chameleon Youth Tours. Budget Tours for young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty five.
Inexpensive, cheap. This could be the bait. Do you know what a chameleon is, Jamie?
It's the name of a small animal, a lizard that can change it's colour to merge with it's background. But it's a name that could equally be applied to people as well. People who change their personalities to suit their own ends. Budget Tours. Young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five. Oh yes, there's something strange going on here.
Ben, are you all right?
We can't talk here. We've got to find somewhere to hide. Something about passports.
Yes. Look who she's working for.
Yes. Leave this to me. Polly.
Now, something has happened to you, Polly. I want you to try to remember up to the time we left the hangar.
Now think, Polly. There were three of us in the hangar. You were showing us something. Now, what was it?
The hangar, Polly. The Chameleon Hangar. You said you'd seen the man who did it.
Anyone shot?
I didn't say anyone was shot or murdered, Polly.
I don't know, but I mean to find out. Come on, let's find that place where we can talk.
No, Ben, not now. What puzzles me is this girl pretending to be Polly, yet in a way she is Polly.
No, not in the time. Whatever happened to her happened to her in a few minutes. Look out.
All right. Now Ben, Jamie, we've got to find out more about Chameleon Youth Tours, but the trouble is, we're not free to move around with the authorities looking for us.
No, that's true. You could investigate the hangar.
I'm going back to the Commandant and try and convince him that there's a murderer abroad.
No, Jamie, I want you to find your way back to the Chameleon kiosk and keep an eye on Polly.
Thank you. Ah, Commandant. How nice to see you again.
At least hear what I have to say.
If you're going to speak to the police, then tell them that there's something happening in this airport that may endanger human lives.
Well, since I'm obviously about to be arrested, may I make one last request? Listen to me for just one minute!
But there was a dead body in the Chameleon Tours hangar.
Why, do you know something about it?
One step nearer and I'll blow you all to smithereens! Catch!
What young lady? Where's Polly?
Ah, I shan't be a minute.
Polly.
Ben! Ben, can you hear me?
Ben, can you hear me?
Ben, are you all right? Can you hear me? Ben! Ben! Ben, can you hear me?
Packing cases.
Oh, who is he?
Detective Inspector Crossland, Scotland Yard.
Well, that's the man we found in the Chameleon Tours hangar.
Well, he wasn't every impressed with it the last time.
Well, if you think so. Jamie, stay here and keep an eye on the kiosk. We shan't be long.
Oh, but surely that's unimportant. If
Thank you. I have just carried out a search of the Chameleon Tours hangar. In a packing case, I found the body of a man.
No, he was in a stupefied state, a sort of coma.
I don't know his name but I have a feeling he's one of your employees.
In fact, I think he may be in here.
Do you know what this is?
Things are not always what they seem. Oh careful, it's dangerous. Chameleon Tours are not quite what they seem either.
Well, I'm afraid you won't believe it when you hear it. However. First, Inspector Gascoigne was murdered with a ray gun.
A weapon that has not yet been developed on this Earth.
There, you see? I knew you wouldn't believe it. What's the use?
Very well. Next, I believe Chameleon Tours to be merely a front, a cover.
For the mass kidnapping of young people.
Yes, at this very moment!
But Brian Briggs is your responsibility.
He's a young man who went on a Chameleon Tour and vanished.
Well, he's nowhere to be found.
And neither are my two friends. Which to my mind proves my point. Chameleon Tours are a cover for the abducting of young people.
Well, in view of the facts that I've already presented, the ray gun, this pen and one or two other things, I think we're dealing with people who are not from this planet.
You see, I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Evidence? What about this pen?
I'll demonstrate it for you. Excuse me. Would you mind helping us?
Could you hold this cup out in front of you?
Oh, perhaps you've seen one of these before?
Do you call that arrant nonsense?
Hmm?
Thank you, my dear.
What, not even for these?
I think it's the further evidence you required, Inspector. Yes, just as I thought.
All falling into pattern. This envelope is addressed to somewhere in Germany.
Well, if we knew that we wouldn't be sitting here.
Thank you, Commandant.
Thank you very much.
Ah.
How many flights do they use a day?
How many planes do they use?
Eight flights a day and only four planes. Is that normal?
Which is the Chameleon plane?
What's the range of your radar?
I was just wondering when this plane first appeared.
How long do you hold them after take off?
Oh, I see. That means they might be anywhere.
I don't think I've been wasting a minute, but I'll go if you insist. Sam, Jamie.
Oh, it's all right. It's quite my fault. Haven't I met you somewhere before?
You must have a double.
Jamie, have you ever known me to be mistaken?
Hey. Now watch out.
That's the wall the gas-nozzles came out of.
You're right. Well, that's clever. That's very clever. Oh well, makes life simpler for us. Now, the man I froze came from here somewhere.
Well. somewhere in that solid wall there's a door.
I don't know. Perhaps if we find that door, we'll find them. Come on, you take that end, I'll take this.
We must hurry. Inspector Crossland's keeping them busy at the moment, but he'll be no match for them. If he presses them too far.
Jamie, look!
Someone who's not used to the Earth's atmosphere. Very interesting. Ah, a TV monitor set. Let's see what we can see.
Well it looks like a hospital. Jamie, we're getting warmer, which is a change from the last time I was here. Come on, let's see if there's a First Aid post in Gatwick Airport.
No, let's get along to the first aid post.
Oh, my back!
Jamie, my back!
What's happening? I can't move. What's that?
That's just a small foretaste of what'll happen to us if we don't move and quickly.
No. Wait. One thing. It's a long chance but it just might work. Have you got a mirror in that bag?
Let's see. Yes, that'll do. Hand it to me.
I can't move my hand. Jamie, can you take it?
Right now, see if you can point it at that laser gun.
That thing on the wall.
Well, if you can reflect the light back, we've got a chance.
Quick, Jamie, now!
Oh, well done.
I wonder if
No.
I think they were needed for some purpose.
We were obviously too dangerous for them.
Yes. It means only one thing, I'm afraid. Their plans are almost complete. We'll have to act fast if we're going to save Polly and Ben.
No, I've not forgotten him, Sam, but if my guess is right they're all in the same place.
I don't know. Wait. The first aid post.
We saw a first aid post on that monitor.
We must find it. Well, come on. You're not going to sit there all day, are you? Just a minute. We can't all go down to the Medical Unit.
Did you get a good look at the man who tried to kill us?
Go down to the Chameleon Kiosk and see if he comes in or out.
But be careful. Don't let him see you.
Yes. I just hope she doesn't try to be too adventurous.
We'll have you as right as rain in a minute. Now just get you down here. There we are. Splendid.
(sotto) Very well, but don't over do it. Yes, this is the room we saw on the TV monitor.
It's a rare tropical disease, Nurse. I'm his doctor. If he if he doesn't rally soon we shall, we shall have to use somnalin.
Yes, yes, somnalin. I shall have to get him somewhere to lie down.
Oh, yes, this will do nicely.
Why not? It's just an x-ray room, isn't it? Isn't that a couch behind the screen.
You refuse to help my patient?
Oh I see. Well why didn't you tell me in the first place.
Let's get you out of here.
Well, no. Why?
But I told her to. Where is she now?
Go down and join her, Jamie. She's a very strong headed young woman. See she doesn't come to any trouble.
Commandant, did the Inspector say where he was going?
And now he's disappeared?
I don't think so. My two friends became involved with Chameleon Tours and they've both disappeared. However, you know what I think's happened.
Well, that's a step in the right direction.
You're still thinking in Earth terms.
Might I have a word with you, my dear?
I suspect that the Medical Centre is connected with all this.
Now, please don't get like him. Oh yes, there is definitely a connection. Now, I would like to get in there and have a look round.
But I would like to get that nurse out of the way first. Do you think that you could manage it for me?
I'm just going off duty, but this gentleman will be pleased to attend to you.
Very well done.
Ample time.
It's all right, Commandant. She was acting on my instructions.
Yes. What do you think of these?
I think there's somebody here who can tell us.
Excuse me. Where's the chap who usually sits there?
I see. Oh well, these'll have to wait.
How high can fighters go these days, Commandant?
How futile.
Normally you don't plot them at this range?
That plane isn't just off course. Something's happened to it.
I don't think you'll get a reply.
It's standing still!
Why do you think the Chameleon plane crashed into the sea?
But it stood still first.
Why do you think that?
What about straight up?
Exactly.
Do you still think these people are from Earth?
I think it's just come in. Do you mind if I question him? I think I know how to make him talk.
You know what this is, don't you?
Oh I think you do. Roll up your sleeve.
You only think he's working for you. Commandant, your personnel are being systematically replaced, and this is how they are doing it. This is not Meadows, it only looks like Meadows. He's wearing one of these things on his arm.
Stop him!
Roll up his left sleeve.
There we are. Now then. What happens if I were to turn one of these?
Ah, I see. Right. Now then, you are going to answer all my questions, and in return, I promise no harm will come to you. Do you understand?
Where are your planes taking all their passengers?
Why are you abducting all these young people?
This is part of the process?
How many of these young people do you hope to abduct?
How large is this satellite?
I see. How many of your people are working here at Gatwick Airport?
Very well. What happens to the people whose identity has been taken over, the originals?
Why not?
Because if we do find them, we'll find one of these on their arms, eh? And if we remove it, something terrible will happen to you?
What if you have to change back?
The machine in the Medical Centre?
Nurse? What about her?
Where is it?
I think you do know. Now, are you going to tell me?
Right, you're going to show me where it is.
Are you going to co-operate or are you not?
I think I'd better take him down there. The Medical Centre.
Bring him in.
I think you two have something in common.
Roll up your sleeves.
Officer!
Certainly.
Now then, where is her original?
Would you rather be destroyed? Keep an eye on her, officer. Bring him along.
Sam! Sam, are you all right?
Are you all right, Sam?
You're lucky it was no worse.
Just checking up. Now then, where is the Nurse's original?
All right, Officer.
It's all right, Sam. It's all right.
Put her on here.
Will there be any permanent damage?
It's all right. You'll be quite all right in a few minutes. There.
What on Earth are these doing here?
Jamie! Where?
Pinch your ticket?
Oh. You mean Jamie has
First Polly and Ben, now Jamie. We've no time to lose.
Over here. I'll show you. I found these in the Medical Centre. Records of twenty five people who work here. Each one of these has been taken over by Chameleons.
What is it?
The last flight? Well that's exactly why they mustn't be arrested.
Will you please listen to me!
These people must not be arrested.
Somewhere in outer space, there are fifty thousand young people, three of my friends amongst them, and somehow we've got to bring them back. I want to get on this last flight, which means the Chameleons must think that everything is going according to plan.
At the moment, you look like a man called Meadows. Could you shed that identity and become somebody else?
Good. Then in that case I shall pretend I am a Chameleon, and get on board that way.
I don't know till I get to the satellite, and then I will have one card to play, and that's up to you Commandant.
The people the Chameleons have taken over, the originals, are hidden somewhere here in Gatwick Airport. You have got to find them.
No, no, no! Find them, by all means, but don't tamper with those arm sheaths. Otherwise we lose our one threat. The one thing I may be able to bargain with.
That will depend entirely on Nurse Pinto.
Now, is everything clear? You're sure you understand what I am asking you to do?
The Doctor became too suspicious of me as Meadows. I was able to kidnap him. The rest is as you can see.
You think that will be useful?
That means that you'll be taking us up to the satellite?
The re-processing. It's difficult to remember details.
In a safe place.
Tell me where that is and I'll have it transferred.
I don't know. However, we've got aboard that plane. Come on, don't let's be late.
I don't know. I should think we're almost there. Don't worry.
I don't know. Let's follow the others.
We slip away and see if we can find these young people. Come on. Ah, Captain Blade, we're carrying out your instructions. We're looking for the accommodation centre.
Captain Blade, what is this? I don't understand. We're here to stay, aren't we?
I'm very sorry. I simply don't understand what you mean.
Oh.
A chance to plead with you for the lives of fifty thousand young people.
And what are you?
Why, Jamie!
Oh no, of course, it's, it's not Jamie. You're a Chameleon. Well, I don't think you've done a very good job on him.
Well you've lost his Scots accent in the process. Oh, I much preferred the original.
Really?
It'll be one of your friends, I've no doubt. It's understandable. The special people up here feel more secure if their originals are actually in the satellite.
The Director has nothing to worry about because his original, Detective Inspector Crossland is actually on board. But (to Blade) where's your original? (to Spencer) And where's yours?
Well, as I see it, there are two categories. People like your Director and that man over there whose originals are safe on board here. And then there are people like you two, whose originals have been left behind at Gatwick airport. If they're tampered with, you're finished.
Yes, you'd better process me quickly, because any minute now you'll cease to exist. You're first on the list.
Oh, surely you understand? We've found all of the originals. The Commandant at the Airport is going to deprocess them one by one, starting with you, unless I stop him.
Ah, that I can't tell you. But they'd been searching for some time and just as I was about to board the aircraft I got a signal which meant that they'd been successful. Otherwise I wouldn't have come. Well, if you don't believe me, check with Gatwick Airport. I imagine you know its radio frequency?
You're going to get a surprise when twenty five of your people disintegrate.
Now then, now what is it you want me to do?
Tell me, what happens if you disintegrate in the middle of my being processed? I mean, will that do me any harm, being suspended between one thing and another, so to speak?
Oh dear.
You're quite sure it's safe now?
By the time they tell you that there's nothing wrong with it, you'll all have disintegrated, except of course the Director.
Yes, you're quite right, it only concerns these two. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Release the Nurse first.
Are you quite all right, my dear.
Good. Commandant, this is the Doctor speaking.
Stand by while I negotiate. Now then, I will tell you my terms. I will guarantee your continued existence, if you will return to Earth all the young people you abducted.
Then reverse the process.
In your former state, I'm afraid. Your scientists will have to think of some other way out of your dilemma.
Commandant, are you still there?
Negotiations have been successfully concluded as arranged.
Good. Please stay listening out on this frequency. I am leaving Captain Blade in charge of the radio.
Yes, I think I can now.
I'm going to try and find my three friends and the Inspector. You know where they are?
You will take me to them. I will call you again.
Jamie! Ha, I'm glad to see you alive.
I'll explain to you one day. Well, come along out. You look like a soldier in a sentry box standing there. Sit down.
Ah, good.
Yes, I'm going with Nurse Pinto. Are you going, Inspector?
I'll see you on the plane, Nurse.
So long as you keep your side of the bargain, you may return to your planet unharmed. Perhaps your scientists will be able to find some way out of their dilemma. I may be able to give them one or two ideas of my own.
Yes. Yes.
There's just one thing, Commandant.
Our Tardis. Our police box.
The police box on the runway.
Thank you, Commandant.
Goodbye, Samantha. Come along, Jamie. We must find Ben and Polly and get to the Tardis.
This will do. My thanks to the Commandant.
Doing? I'm looking for the Tardis, of course.
Normal? What do you mean, Ben?
Do you? What about Chameleon Tours?
It's July. July the 20th, to be precise.
You really want to go, don't you?
Yes, I know. You're lucky, I never got back to mine. All right, then. Off you go. Now go on, Ben can catch his ship and become an Admiral, and you Polly, you can look after Ben.
Ben.
Well you'd better hurry. The Commandant's car waiting.
Yes, Jamie. So am I. Well, we've got things to do.
Well, I didn't tell the others, but we've lost the Tardis.
It was outside. It's not there now.
I don't know, but that's what we're going to find out. Come on!

Just got to get my hand there.
What's the matter?
Up you come. There we are. Come on, Victoria. Give me your hand.
It was a blind landing.
Well, let's see, shall we? Very careful. I'm going to get out. It's quite a long drop.
Come on, Victoria. That's right.
You're on my hand!
Yes, that's not ice, that's plastic.
Yes. It's a dome. A protective dome.
I know!
Something's wrong.
We're discovered.
Oh, thank you.
She doesn't want to know, Jamie.
Rather inhospitable. We've only just arrived.
Hush, Jamie.
It sounds like electronic machinery. Like a computer. There's something wrong with it's pitch.
No.
Let's go in.
Oh, there's something very wrong here.
Seven two point four? That's bad.
17 degrees? Well, this is serious!
One three seven nine? Excuse me, I
No! We're not scavengers!
No! In two minutes thirty eight seconds, you're going to have an almighty explosion! The readings say so!
I don't need a computer.
No, it isn't. It doesn't have to happen. If you'll excuse me.
Cut out the reactor link for a start! Uncouple the transformer unit. (something) the density phase and power.
Well, a quick short burst then from the reactor unit, now. Off! Now link the circuits with the reactor link. Now, bring in the computer stabiliser. Yes, that should hold it steady. It's not a perfect job, mind you. You ought to get an expert in, you know.
Oh no, it was near enough correct. Give or take a second.
Check it on your precious computer then.
Well, a second out. We can't all be perfect.
What's the matter?
Thank you. Now, Jamie, (something)
Look, aren't we wasting time? If you want our help, why not tell us all about it?
Well, as a matter of fact, we've been in retreat. In Tibet. We are sanctifiers.
I see. And if I fail?
Very well, fire away.
Yes.
Oh, possible causes. The reversal of the magnetic field.
Interstellar clouds obscuring the suns rays? An excessive burst of sunspot activity. A severe shift of the Earth's angle of rotation.
There aren't that many alternatives. Gigantic heat loss?
Oh. Oh, well, in that case the answer's simple. A severe drop in the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that it?
Well, the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps retain the sun's heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze up.
Well
Up to date?
No plants, no carbon dioxide.
Yeah, it's like a magnifying glass, Jamie.
Can't your computers solve the problem of control?
Well.
Oh, I see. And when will that be?
What's the position now?
And the glaciers will win. I see.
Well I'm willing to try.
Only when I have to.
Oh, I'll try and remember that.
Well, never mind.
Frozen for centuries in the ice. Perfectly preserved. Ooo, that's odd though.
Well the helmet, it's wrong. When this man was frozen to death only primitive cavemen existed.
You see, this fellow Arden has set the electricity so that the ice melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance.
Well, I suspect there are some impurities in the ice. I say. Look at that.
It's an electronic connection. I'm sure of it.
Now you wait here, and don't touch anything.
Oh, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere. Why don't you label your doors?
Yes, I realise that, and I'm sorry.
Look, I wouldn't intrude if I didn't think it necessary. What I have to say is extremely important. After all, you did ask me to help you, didn't you?
Well, it has something to do with that, yes.
This is serious!
Thank you. It's the, it's the helmet. It's not what we thought it was.
No! It has electronic connections.
No, I'm positive. You realise what this means?
Yes, indeed. They even had astronauts, it appears.
This headpiece is no warriors tin-hat. It's a highly sophisticated space helmet!
If this is true your project is in danger.
How did he get here? Well, he didn't walk, did he?
Yes, and where is that spaceship now?
This reactor pile could be exploded or be activated.
Yes, well, I thought you ought to know.
Jamie!
What?
Strange.
For a human being, maybe.
Look at this table.
Yes, but a high current.
But if that current passed through a low resistance.
Yes Jamie, you're right. Come on. She can't have gone far.
But she may be in danger of her life! You can't take that decision!
It's a waste of time asking the computer.
Come on, Jamie, have patience. Give it a chance.
Shush, Jamie.
Well, he didn't come by Shetland Pony, Jamie.
Yes, he's a capable lad.
That was from your staff, Jamie's extra.
Oh good.
Well, I still think you ought to get in an expert. Why can't you get one?
But why?
No, I'm here to help you, if I choose.
This chap Penley.
Temperamental or individual? Creative scientists have to be allowed some head you know.
It couldn't have been just a simple gesture of protest?
And your name will suffer. That's important.
So you do need Penley.
Well, I'll try and help you, but I do think you might try trusting human beings instead of computers.
Oh, that's disgusting. It's just the thing. Did you do this?
Oh, he'll be all right. Did you see who did do it?
Was there a girl there?
Well, why didn't you try and stop them?
But she's only a young girl!
Yes. Yes, I see.
No, no, they're searching already. There's a red alarm all over the base.
Penley?
They need you here, you know. They need you desperately.
They're your problems too, you know. It's your world.
I expect you know what you're doing.
Oh, thank you.
Goodbye.
Where's Victoria?
With a power pack? You mean the one that you used to unfreeze him?
No. That's what he wants us to do. That's why he's taken Victoria with him as a hostage. No, we must let him show his hand first.
We're not going to. Only until morning. That'll be time enough.
You take care of yourself, Jamie, and keep an eye on Arden. I don't think he quite realises how dangerous this creature is.
Well, he's a scientist and a bit inclined to have his head in the air. You know what they're like.
Good luck.
Good luck, Jamie!
Miss Garrett? Oh, no, no. There's no need to go into formalities.
Now Clent, just remember I am not a member of your staff. I'm just a working guest, as you might say.
Your regulations do not apply to me. I work in my own way, freely.
Breakdown? I thought you said he defected?
Oh, I see.
If I was to reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Where did I? Yes, here we are. If I reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Excuse me. Excuse me! Yes.
Mmm? Yes.
Four. What computer?
Six. Yes, they're useful for digital analysis, but I very rarely use them, except when I have to. There is one thing you could do for me which would be very important.
Lend me a pencil. Oh, that would be even better.
Now, this is wrong, this is wrong. It's not right. There's something missing.
Supposing I? What are they?
Oh, computer checked, I hope?
Oh, thank heavens for that.
What are they? Omega. Well, what does he mean? Omega. What does he? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Yes! Yes, of course. The Omega Factor! There and here and there. Yes! Ha ha! Your friend Penley is very clever.
Yes, that's it!
Oh, when you've been at it as long as I have it's nothing.
Possible? It's perfect! Well, it's nearly perfect.
Oh, it'll work, all right.
Computer?
I resent that!
It should be the other way round.
I shall demand an apology, you know.
Well, I'm glad you had time to look up Penley's notes.
Pity that he turned traitor.
Oh? Oh, it's nice to see he still has some friends in the base.
How?
There is? Where?
Well make sure you don't go too near.
Isn't it about time that Arden and Jamie reported again?
Yes, very human. I'm worried about them too.
He's not answering. Perhaps something has happened to them.
Jamie, answer me! Jamie, what's happened? Jamie! Jamie!
I will never forgive myself if anything's happened to Jamie.
Oh, your ioniser will work all right.
What do you mean, I'm only human? Well as a matter of fact
I told you it would.
I told you it would.
Very likely. But somewhere, out on that ice face, are two young people for whom I have considerable affection. That is no triumph!
They're not colleagues, they're friends.
I've played mine. It's finished.
Aren't you forgetting something?
No, no, I don't mean that. Arden. He's not yet completed his mission.
It's Victoria! Victoria, where are you?
Are you all right?
What?
What? Well, is he dead? Is, is he wounded? Is he badly wounded?
What do you mean?
Victoria, tell us more about the warriors.
Can you describe them to us, Victoria dear?
Victoria? Victoria, what's happened? Are you all right? Answer me!
You're not hurt?
Victoria. Victoria. Can you see the base from where you are?
Do you think you can get back to it?
Well, get in contact again as soon as you can. Good luck.
Yes. This is an automatic chemical dispenser, is it not?
How does it work?
May I? There's something I need rather desperately.
Water.
Ah, that's better. Now then, let's see. Jamie has vanished.
Victoria's on her way back to the base. And neither of them can help us with our main problem.
An exact description of the spacecrafts propulsion unit.
I will.
We know these creatures come from Mars, don't we? What do we know about their planets atmospheric conditions?
Then they're not going to enjoy this little concoction much, are they?
Well, if I'm going to an alien spaceship it may come in handy.
Arden fell into a trap. I know what to expect.
Splendid! You go instead then!
I can be spared. I've done all I can here. The ioniser will work without me. I'd start getting it ready if I were you.
Oh, you'll manage.
It's as simple as this. Someone has to get to the spacecraft, find out what sort of propulsion unit it has, and bring the information back to you, or we can't use the ioniser. Now, who better than me?
Thank you.
Ah. Now I don't suppose you have a small radio transmitter?
Oh. Well, you won't see me, but you'll hear me. As soon as I get to the glacier face I'll switch it on and you'll overhear. I hope.
Why, what else do I need?
But I'm not going to fight a duel.
Oh, I don't think so. This is my defence.
I think they'll listen to me.
That is exactly what I'm going to do.
Oh, it's you again, is it?
No. Are you looking for someone?
No, nobody. Not even like me.
Can I help you?
Well, why should I? I don't believe everything Clent tells me.
You know where he is? Is he hurt?
Yes, there we are.
Ah, won't be long before you're on your feet again, Jamie.
Well, that depends. You've had some sort of shock to your brain. It's affected your nervous system.
Oh, yes, of course you will. It's just a matter of time, that's all.
Well the base is the only place he can be treated.
Yes. It'll flatten this place in no time at all.
Well, that's just it, you see. I can't go. There's something I must do.
He's a man with a mission. I don't think he can afford to reject you.
I must speak with the warriors.
I have to see whether Victoria got away safely, and I must find out whether this spacecraft is a danger to the ionisation programme. I admit it won't be easy.
Their guest I hope, Jamie.
Here we go, Clent old chap. Wish me luck.
Anyone at home?
Open up. Come on. Open up, I say! Very well, I shall count to ten. One, two, three. Ah!
I never answer questions until I'm addressed properly.
But if you do that my body will explode.
All right, all right! I don't think much of your hospitality.
Me? I'm a scientist. I've come to talk with you.
To help you.
Yes. Yes, you could call me that.
Looks aren't everything, you know.
Well if you kill me, you'll ruin any chance you may have of escape.
Ah, thank you very much. That's very civil of you. Oh, my word!
No, I am sure I can help you. On certain conditions.
On the contrary, it is you who are the prisoner, and I can help you.
Well, what good will that do? You are buried alive in the heart of this glacier. Time is desperately short. You've got no time to bargain over hostages.
Weapon? But the ioniser is not a weapon.
Yes, of course. It'll melt the ice and set you free!
Victoria!
It's all right. We are not beaten yet.
He's alive.
Well, there are difficulties.
Well.
No, but of your ship. If the ioniser sets off a nuclear holocaust, it will all have be in vain.
Well, in that case we'd have no choice.
But it wouldn't harm the ship. It would release it.
Oh, I always live in hope.
You do realise, don't you, that after a certain point, my base will
Have to activate the ioniser regardless of the consequences?
Is that what would happen?
It's an ion reactor, isn't it? Hmm. It could be dangerous, but it wouldn't necessarily explode.
Now why don't you let us help you?
But what else do you need, apart from escaping from the ice?
Well, I've told you all I can about the ioniser.
Why on earth do you want to know that?
Oh, so that's what you need, is it?
Fuel! Fuel for your reactor! And suppose I don't tell you?
Yes, you'll find what you need at the base.
But you won't find Leader Clent easy to persuade. He's a very obstinate man.
It's all right Victoria, don't cry. It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Come along, Victoria, blow. Blow.
That's better, that's better. (sotto) We can try and escape with this.
(sotto) Ammonium sulphide.
(sotto) Yes, you've had the benefits of a classical education. Yes, it is what you'd call a stink bomb.
(sotto) You'd be surprised. Harmless to humans, but to aliens very possibly deadly!
I can't get it undone.
Shush.
It's not just a question of escape, Victoria. We've got to take some action. It's this gun that's given Varga control of the base. Without it he'd be helpless.
Yes. Now this is Varga's main weapon. There's just a chance that I can turn it against him.
If I can open these doors. There we are. Come on.
Now careful. Just stay there. How does this gun operate?
Well, it's a little difficult to explain, Victoria. Oh. Oh dear. Hold this for me, will you? This gun works on the basis that sound waves produce reverberations in the objects in their path.
Yes, that's right. Well if you can produce unsympathetic vibrations, damage results.
Yes. But I want to be able to get at the warriors without it affecting the scientists too much. Now, if we change this to frequency seven.
Well, primarily it affects fluids.
Well, I believe that Varga and his warriors have a far greater fluid content than human beings. There.
That's just it. I don't know.
But I do know that whatever effect it has on the scientists, it'll have a far greater one on the warriors.
Well, apart from the fluid question, their helmets will trap and intensify the soundwaves.
Well, that's what I'm hoping, but there is just a vague risk that it'll kill everybody. Clent and Penley included.
It's a risk we must take, Victoria!
Now, cross your fingers. Here we go.
Varga, this is the Doctor. Are you going to retreat, or shall I fire again? The trouble is I dare not use it again. If it hasn't killed them all already, another firing most certainly will. Varga! Answer me or I fire again!
Get well back, Victoria.
Stand by for fireworks. Here we go.
Now, quickly. Let's get out of here before they come back. (Later, while all the humans are still out cold, Zondal wakes.)
Victoria, see if you can find Jamie.
Oh thank goodness for that. Now you get back to the Tardis, and close the doors.
Sorry about that. Up you get. Come along.
No time for questions. Come along.
Up you get. Come along, Miss Garrett. There you are.
Then it must be switched on again immediately.
Clent, their spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor.
Of course there's a risk, but it's a risk we must take. It's the only way!
But that's why in this case you cannot rely on its judgement!
Not this time.
Because Jamie, the computer is faced with an insoluble problem. Either way it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do. It must play safe.
I'll explain to you another time, Jamie.
A decision must be taken, and quickly!
Penley, it's up to you.
Well, Penley?
Oh. Goodness me!

In the late 1970s? You'd be better off in a bin bag. Hold on, listen to this.
Ian Dury and the Blockheads. Number One in 1979.
It's good to be a lunatic.
Would you like to see him?
What else is a Tardis for? I can take you to the Battle of Trafalgar, the first anti-gravity Olympics, Caesar crossing the Rubicon or Ian Dury at the Top Rank, Sheffield, England, Earth, 21st November, 1979. What do you think?
Hold on tight.
1979. Hell of a year. China invades Vietnam. The Muppet Movie. Love that film. Margaret Thatcher. Urgh. Skylab falls to Earth, with a little help from me. Nearly took off my thumb.
And I like my thumb. I need my thumb. I'm very attached to
My thumb.
1879. Same difference.
Are we in Scotland?
Oh, I'm, I'm dazed and confused. I've been chasing this, this wee naked child over hill and over dale. Isn't that right, ya timorous beastie?
No, don't do that.
No, really don't. Really.
I'm Doctor James McCrimmon, from the township of Balamory. I have my credentials, if I may.
As you can see, a Doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. I trained under Doctor Bell himself.
Rose, might I introduce her Majesty Queen Victoria. Empress of India and Defender of the Faith.
Does it? Yes, it does. Good. Good. Then let me ask - why is Your Majesty travelling by road when there's a train all the way to Aberdeen?
An accident?
An assassination attempt?
1879? She's had, oh, six attempts on her life? And I'll tell you something else. We just met Queen Victoria!
What a laugh!
Like a stamp.
Well, if I gambled on that, it'd be an abuse of my privileges of traveller in time.
Done.
She's a feral child. I bought her for sixpence in old London Town. It's was her or the Elephant Man, so
So what's in there, then?
I wish I'd met him. I like him. That thing's beautiful. Can I?
What did he model it on?
It's a bit rubbish. How many prisms has it got? Way too many. The magnification's gone right over the top. That's stupid kind of (to Rose) Am I being rude again?
But it's pretty. It's very pretty.
Stars and magic. I like him more and more.
That's Bavaria.
So, what's this wolf, then?
Then tell it.
Oh, that's all right. Save her a wee bit of ham.
Besides, we're all waiting on Sir Robert. Come, sir. You promised us a tale of nightmares.
You must miss him.
Are there descriptions of the creature?
A werewolf?
And what if they were with us right now?
Rose! Where's Rose? Where is she? Sir Robert, come on!
Oh, that's beautiful.
Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!
It could be any form of light modulated species triggered by specific wavelengths. Did it say what it wanted?
All right, you men. We should retreat upstairs. Come with me.
I'm telling you, come upstairs!
There's nothing we can do!
The front door's no good, it's been boarded shut. Pardon me, Your Majesty. You'll have to leg it out of a window.
Yeah, any chance you could hurry up?
I reckon the monkey boys want us to stay inside.
We run.
You got any silver bullets?
There we are then, we run. Your Majesty, as a Doctor, I recommend a vigourous jog. Good for the health. Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Bullets can't stop it!
Rose!
Wait a minute. Shush, shush, wait a minute.
It's stopped.
It's gone.
Is this the only door?
Something inside this room. What is it? Why can't it get in?
What?
I know. You all right?
Well, they were bald, athletic. Your wife's away, I just thought you were happy.
You'd call it a werewolf, but technically it's a more of a lupine wavelength haemovariform.
Oh right, sorry, that's
Mistletoe. Sir Robert, did you father put that there?
On the other door, too. No, a carving wouldn't be enough. I wonder.
Viscum album, the oil of the mistletoe. It's been worked into the wood like a varnish. How clever was your dad? I love him. Powerful stuff, mistletoe. Bursting with lectins and viscotoxins.
Well, it thinks it is. The monkey monk monks need a way of controlling the wolf, maybe they trained it to react against certain things.
Oh, your father got all the brains, didn't he?
Good. I meant that one. You want weapons? We're in a library. Books! Best weapons in the world. This room's the greatest arsenal we could have.
Arm yourself.
Hold on, what about this? A book on mistletoe.
Hmm, that's the sort of thing.
Look what your old dad found. Something fell to Earth.
Maybe just a single cell survived. Adapting slowly down the generations, it survived through the humans, host after host after host.
Imagine it. The Victorian Age accelerated. Starships and missiles fueled by coal and driven by steam, leaving history devastated in its wake
Hardly the time to worry about your valuables.
Oh, yes. The greatest diamond in the world.
Well, that's true of anything if you own it long enough. Can I?
That is so beautiful.
They say the wages of the entire planet for a whole week.
And she'd win.
Why do you travel with it?
Now, there's a fact. Prince Albert kept on having the Koh-I-Noor cut down. It used to be forty percent bigger than this. But he was never happy. Kept on cutting and cutting.
Unfinished. Oh, yes.
There's a lot of unfinished business in this house. His father's research, and your husband, Ma'am, he came here and he sought the perfect diamond. Hold on, hold on. All these separate things, they're not separate at all, they're connected. Oh, my head, my head. What if this house, it's a trap for you. Is that right, Ma'am?
At least, that's what the wolf intended. But, what if there's a trap inside the trap?
What if his father and your husband weren't just telling each other stories. They dared to imagine all this was true, and they planned against it, laying the real trap not for you but for the wolf.
That wolf there.
Out! Out! Out!
Get to the observatory!
Good shot.
Come on!
No mistletoe in these doors because your father wanted the wolf to get inside. I just need time. Is there any way of barricading this?
If we could bind them shut with rope or something.
Good man.
Your Majesty, the diamond.
The purpose it was designed for.
Rose.
Lift it. Come on.
Yes it is.
It doesn't work as a telescope because that's not what it is. It's a light chamber. It magnifies the light rays like a weapon. We've just got to power it up.
You're seventy percent water but you can still drown. Come on! Come on!
Your Majesty? Did it bite you?
If that thing bit you?
Let me see.
Many thanks, Ma'am.
Your Majesty, you said last night about receiving no message from the great beyond. I think your husband cut that diamond to save your life. He's protecting you even now, Ma'am, from beyond the grave.
I'm sorry?
Cheers, Dougal!
No, but the funny thing is, Queen Victoria did actually suffer a mutation of the blood. It's historical record. She was haemophiliac. They used to call it the Royal Disease. But it's always been a mystery because she didn't inherit it. Her mum didn't have it, her dad didn't have it. It came from nowhere.
Well, maybe haemophilia is just a Victorian euphemism.
Could be.
Could be. And her children had the Royal Disease. Maybe she gave them a quick nip.
Well, maybe not yet. I mean, a single wolf cell could take a hundred years to mature. Might be ready by, oh, early 21st century?
I'll say no more.

Pass me the vibro-cutters.
Come on then, pass them to me.
Why have you got two jackets?Is one of them faulty?
Of course we won't starve. The sand piranhas will get us long before that.
Fish people.
Fish. And people. Come and see.
Tardis has got to be round this corner. I hate soldiers. Don't you hate soldiers?
Just keep running!
Clara, you, you look lovely today. Have you had a wash?
Because it works on you. Listen, I'm sorry but there's going to be no trip today. I'm sorry. Er, I've got to do a thing. It might take a while.
Just a thing.
I'm a man of mystery.
Undercover. Deep cover.
What do you mean?
Of course I can do deep cover.
I'll see you when I see you.
When I see you.
Excellent. I was meaning to bring it up.
I'm the new caretaker. John Smith.
Thanks. Yes, John Smith's the name. But, you know, here's a thing. Most people just call me the Doctor.
So, if anybody needs me, just, you know, give me a shout. I'll be in the storeroom just getting the lie of the land.
Yes, no body's taking any notice at all. Absolutely good news because it means I must be coming across just as an absolutely boring human being like you.
Deep cover. Deep cover.
So, you recognised me, then.
But you saw straight through that.
He's fine. Hypnotised. He thinks he's got the 'flu. Also a flying car and three wives. It's going to be a rude awakening.
It's assembly. You'd better get going. Go and worship something.
Listen, it's lovely talking to you, but I've really got to get on. I'm a caretaker now. Look, I've got a brush.
Yes, me. Now, go. The walls need sponging and there's a sinister puddle.
I lived among otters once for a month. Well, I sulked. River and I, we had this big fight
Exactly. It'll be even easier.
No. Nobody is safe. But soon the answer will be yes, everybody is safe, if you let me get on. Now, pretend you don't know me. Stay out of my way. The less you know, the better. I'll explain it all later. Go and sing with the otters.
That's fine. That's a perfectly normal reaction.
Wrong.
On the board. Wrong. Wrong.
Just taking care.
Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in 1796.
Not in 1797, because she didn't have the time. She was so busy doing all
No, I read the book. There's a bio at the back.
Boggons?
I'm sure I won't need you, Sergeant. Fully qualified. (sparks) You best get back to your PE class.
Do you? What, in emergencies?
How does that work? What if the kids have questions?
Maths.
But he said you were a soldier.
But what about all the PE?
Sorry, that seems very unlikely.
Yes, you better run along, Sergeant. That ball isn't going to kick itself, is it?
Nope, sorry. No, I can't retain that. I've tried. It's just not going in.
Yeah. The colour.
Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah. Same name, doesn't look anything like him though.
Does he? I don't know. Who remembers a PE teacher?
So, is he here then?
The one that you keep going on serious dates with.
I promise I won't. I'm being nice.
Oh, I see.
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Yes, yes, no, of course, of course, yes. Don't mind this old man. You two kids just pop off together.
I'm a caretaker. Don't mind me.
(sotto) Oh, Clara.
What does that mean? Kids. What's the matter with kids today?
And one for luck.
Okay. Now we're in business. Let's see the lie of the land. Time to see what's going on.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most dangerous of them all?
Can't you read?
The door. It says,Keep Out.
Oh, so it does. Never lose your temper in the middle of a door sign.
Thecaretaker's box. Every caretaker has their own box.
Exactly, there's a policeman in there, in case of emergencies and children. Towels, there, g-g-go.
Of course there was. What's a policeman without a death ray?
Oh, listen, there's the bell. Off you go. Haven't you got shoplifting to go to?
Oh, yes, fine. Well, cut along, you're running out of time.
Everything. Human beings have incredibly short life spans. Frankly, you should all be in a permanent state of panic. Tick tock, tick tock.
Yes, I am. What about you?
Good to meet you.
Now get lost.
Paper towels. Now, I imagine you have many questions. Fire away. I won't answer any of them.
What were who like?
Well, it's lucky I'm here, then.
Me?
You don't know that.
It's a scanner. I'm scanning. Why do I keep you around?
Any alien technology in this vicinity should show up. I used to have a teacher exactly like you once.
A Skovox Blitzer. One of the deadliest killing machines ever created. Probably homed in here because of artron emissions. You've had enough of them in this area over the years. There's enough explosive in its armoury to take out the whole planet.
Sooner or later it will creep from its hidey-hole and some military idiot will try to attack it.
The world is full of PE teachers.
This is a very special watch.
Correct. I am invisible and I am incredible. It's simply a matter of reversing light waves. Hang on, I'm coming back.
So, I give the Blitzer a tiny whiff of non-threatening alien tech, I lead it back here, but I don't want it to scan me, hence invisible.
My school? Oh, that is telling. This is the only suitably empty place in the area. I've set up a circle of time mines around the school. Chronodyne generators. Bit unstable.
I switch them on, the Blitzer gets sucked into a big old time vortex, billions of years into the future. It's dead easy. Tiny bit boring. I'll need a book and a sandwich.
I don't need you this time. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll go somewhere nice. Ancient Egypt. Crocodilopolis. They worship a big crocodile there, so the name is a useful coincidence. Go and canoodle with your boyfriend. Come on. I wasn't born yesterday. Far from it.
Possibly reminded me of a certain dashing young time traveller.
It's easily done. There's a lot to estimate.
Yes, I like him very, very much. Go home and canoodle. Doctor's orders. Come on.
Oh, sing hosanna.
And we're off.
Home, sweet home.
Where are you, my sleeping beauty?
Gotcha. Let's dance!
Come on, come on, come on.
Gangway! Not far now. Come on.
Bingo.
What? Red? Red. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Listen. I'm unarmed. I'm peaceful. Don't you understand? I, I know that you shouldn't be on this planet but I can help you with that. I
Get back!
(sarcastic) Oh, oh, well done, PE, brilliant work. What's this? A chronodyne generator? I'll just deactivate that, shall I? I've got a swimming certificate so that qualifies me to meddle with higher technology. Never mind that some people are actually trying to save the planet. Oh, no. There's only room in my head for cross-country and the offside rule.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, for the moment. But the thing is, you see, the chronodyne generators have to be precisely aligned to generate the vortex. But the sergeant here, he went and moved one.
But not far enough. The vortex will open here again, but not in a billion years.
Er, seventy four hours. Three days? Three days to think of something new because now it knows what to expect. Now it has scanned me and it will kill me on sight, thanks to PE here.
It's a what?
I'm willing to put a number on it.
Oh, genius. That is, that is really, really brilliant reasoning. How can you think that I'm her dad when we both look exactly the same age?
I was being kind. Right, I'm going to hypnotise him. I'm going to erase his memory.
Tiny little brain, only take a moment.
Well, I'll try not to erase the whole thing. I'll leave the bits that.
Him?
No, he's not.
But he's a PE teacher. You wouldn't go out with a PE teacher. It's a mistake. You've made a boyfriend error.
You're a soldier. Why would you go out with a soldier? Why not get a dog or a big plant?
Why would you say that? Is this part of the surprise play?
Oh, it's a roller coaster with you tonight, isn't it? What about the handsome one, the one with the bow tie?
Go on.
Exhibit A.
(sotto) It's bigger on the inside.
Voila.
No. I'm going to protect you from that thing.
Yes, it is coming back, thanks to you.
And that is the most dangerous thing right there.
Are you sure hypnotising's not on the menu?
Look, take him away. Shut him up, shut him down. Up or down, it doesn't matter to me. I've got a lot of work to do. Again.
Why wouldn't I be okay? I was fine till you two blundered in.
And when this is all over, you can finish the job.
Well, you've explained me to him. You haven't explained him to me.
Afternoon. Thanks for keeping out of my way. You haven't brought Dave with you, I hope.
Pass me that synestic.
It'll be a long, fiddly job. It's going to take me at least twenty four hours. Even longer if people keep talking to me, so do keep going.
If you want bother someone, go and bother PE.
That's a shame, I like maths.
Interesting.
I'm bored. Let's go somewhere fun. What do you say? Do you want to see the Thames frozen over? Oh, those frost fairs.
It's a time machine. We can get back straightaway, like we always do on your dates. Just make sure you don't get yourself a tan or anything, or lose a limb.
You've never said no before. Not even in the middle of dinner. Remember when you had to eat two meals in a row?
Now you mention it, being a Time Lord, I can feel a light shield aura when it's right next to me.
Might have known what?
Definitely not.
And you do not call me sir.
And you can get out of my Tardis!
I am not an officer!
Out. Now.
Yes.
Yes, you are!
On balance, I think that went quite well.
Humans. I never learn.
You want to know what's in that box? I'll tell you what's in that box. It's a time machine. It also travels in space. And it usually contains a man who just wants to get on with his work of preventing the end of the world, but keeps being interrupted by boring little humans.
I'm serious. I'm trying to save this planet.
Is your name really Disruptive Influence?
I'll let you know. I may have a vacancy. But not right now.
Two days. I can do it.
No, no, no. No! No, no, no, no, no!
Clara, the vortex is opening.
PE, shut up. Clara, it'll scan the area. If it gets to parents' evening, it'll kill them all.
Shut up!
It'll be here any second. Get to the hall.
Give it some squirts of helicon energy, setting number forty one. No more than three seconds each, random pulses. Distract it, then you lead it away from the hall, give me two minutes.
Just run straight to the Tardis.
Yes, well, I've revised that down to two minutes. Probably. Clara, go.
No, not like a decoy. As a decoy. Don't they teach you anything at stupid school?
Yes. Yes, and this is very, very important. Leave us alone!
Twenty seconds.
Am I green? Am I green?
Stop! Skovox Blitzer!
Superior Skovox Artificer. Analyse stop analyse stop.
Listening to its superior. This is a rough copy. It thinks I'm its general. Initiate input. Commence shutdown protocol. No conflict. Conclusion?
Conclusion.
The input code. I forgot the final input code.
I need time. Distract it, Clara!
Artificer Artificer. Stop. Confirm stop override final input code.
Okay.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah. Good start.
Farewell, Skovox Blitzer. Have a nice war.
Ah, it can be a bit overwhelming. But look. The Olveron Cluster. A million stars, a hundred million inhabited planets.
Ah, yes. There has been a spillage.

Who?
Yes, I shall miss them too. First Susan and now them. Come over here, my dear, I'd like to talk to you.
Oh, that's all right, my dear. It's already set. Their decision certainly surprised me, although it shouldn't, I know. But it was quite obvious they intended to take the first opportunity of going back home.
It's lucky for you child, they're not here to hear you say that. Good gracious me. You think they're old? What do you think of me?
Well, perhaps Vicki, perhaps.
Yes, it's done now, although I must admit I'm left with a small worry.
My dear Vicki, I'm trying to talk to you.
I just wanted to ask you, are you sure you didn't want to go home too? I didn't give you very much time to consider now, did I? I should hate to think that you're just staying for the sake of an old man.
Yes, your father
Yes, perhaps it's something fallen down, or maybe we've changed course.
Now listen to me, young man. Sit down. Now, there are two things you can do. One, sit there until you get your breath back, and two, don't call me Doc! Now do I make myself clear?
Apart from that young man, I'm quite willing to accept you at your face value.
Oh, does he now?
I don't see why I should, my child. He'll learn soon enough.
That is the dematerialising control and that, over yonder, is the horizontal hold. Up there is the scanner, those are the doors, that is a chair with a panda on it. Sheer poetry, dear boy. Now please stop bothering me.
Vicki?
I've checked up on all the readings. Now I think our guest will need a wash and brush up. So I think the best thing for you to do is go and find him some clothes and a cloak. Bring mine as well. We'll show him whether this is a time machine or not.
Well, judging by the readings, my child, I think we've landed on the planet Earth.
Where did you say you found this, Vicki?
Yes, it's a bit rusted but, er, it's not as old as that. Tenth, eleventh century? England. Well, there you are, young man. What do you think of that now, eh? A Viking helmet.
What do you mean, maybe? What do you think it is, a space helmet for a cow?
Oh, rubbish, rubbish.
Oh, I see, so you've changed your idea's now.
Yes, yes, yes, but unfortunately, we have a slight technical hitch at the moment. Excuse me.
Yes, perhaps we should find a village whereby we can convince this young upstart of the true facts.
Oh, yes? What is it now?
The design is completely immaterial, young man. The Tardis is required to land and blend in with its surroundings.
Yes, quite so. For instance, If we were to land in the middle of the Indian mutiny, well, I'm sure the ship could possibly take on the appearance of a howdah.
A Howdah! A carrier on the back of an elephant.
On the what?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but you do keep on, don't you.
Now I suggest we take a walk along the beach and try and find a spot where the cliffs run down to sea level.
Yes, so possibly it might, but I'm not a mountain goat and I prefer walking to it any day, and I hate climbing!
No, you won't, you'll stay with the ship and wait 'til I've got to the top then you can both climb up and join me.
I'm not going to argue, my child.
Oh, what's this?
Mead? Oh, mead. Yes, of course, yes. Yes, how nice of you, yes. Delightful, thank you, thank you. Well, here's to your very good health.
Oh, delightful. Oh, yes, delightful. Tell me, is the monastery near here?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, quite understandable, you know. Sounds do play funny tricks at times.
Well, that's very kind, very kind indeed. And I do hope they won't worry about me too much. You know, I hadn't intended to walk quite so far. You are near the coast?
Yes, yes.
Oh, of course, of course, my dear. The Vikings, for example?
Yes, I had heard about that battle, yes, yes. The King, er, greatly improved the position no end.
You know, it seems like yesterday that the good King Edward was laid to rest. When was it?
Oh, of course. Yes, yes, yes, the beginning of the year, yes, yes, yes. How silly. Yes, it's most refreshing.
Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you, my dear.
Now, if Harold is king, and Edward was laid to rest at the beginning of the year, then it must be 1066! Yes. Judging by the appearance of these leaves, late summer. And a balmy night, a balmy night.
Oh, thank you, my dear. Thank you, thank you. Er, you know, it's a bit stupid of me but, we are in Northumbria?
Oh, nothing, nothing, I just that I wasn't sure whether I'd crossed the border or not. Yes, it's a bit tedious of me, isn't it? But you must have patience with an old man.
I will, I will, and thank you indeed. Thank you. Yes, it's a great pity that Barbara isn't here. Now, if my memory of English history serves me right, we're about to have a Viking invasion and very soon. Now, let me think. Harold came north to defeat Hardrada, the Norwegian King. Yes, now that was before he faced William the Conqueror at Hastings. It's all very interesting. Yes, that's very, very, very, very interesting. It's going to put that young man in his place.
Woman! Woman! Where are you?
The monastery. Where is it, did you say?
The monks, have they been here long?
And you haven't seen them? No one in the village has?
Oh, you've been very kind, and a great help, yes. I'm sorry, but I must take my leave of you.
I most certainly am.
Go away! I'll come out when I'm ready.
Open this door! Open this door, will you! Open it!
Well, from what you've just said, you've saved me quite a journey.
Yes, indeed so. I told them quite specifically to meet me outside the Tar, the pre-arranged place. I was going along to tell them that I'd come to no harm whilst I was making investigations, as we might say. But, well now, now you tell me they came here and they've gone on to the monastery.
Oh, it's all perfectly simple. I left through the rear entrance. That reminds me. I really think I ought to be wending my way. It's a good thing I saw the smoke rising from your fire. I'm becoming quite a regular visitor, I think.
You've seen them, and their fleet?
Yes, I see. Yes, I see.
What? What was that? I've already told you, my dear, that I've learned of varied plans from all the places that I've visited before.
Yes, yes, I'm afraid so.
The Monk in this situation just can't be a coincidence.
Yes, I must face him. I realise that I've got far short a time than I thought I had. I'm always leaving you in a hurry, I'm afraid, but the matter has some urgency.
Oh, no, thank you, thank you, indeed. It's very kind of you. I must go. Yes, goodbye. Oh, and, don't worry, don't worry. The Vikings will land south of here, in the Humber. And King Harold will defeat them. Yes, and then in a few weeks time, he loses the battle of Hastings to William the Conqueror. Well, at least that's what the history books said happened.
I have a Winchester '73 right in the middle of your spinal cord.
Proceed.
Wait.
Oh, did you now? Well, as it happens, I happen to be a very curious fellow. Yes, very curious. Now then, I have some questions for you and I want them answered. Continue.
All right, that will do. You know, I believe we've come through this corridor twice already. It's no use you playing for time, you know. I want some answers!
Ah ha! Now, I wouldn't do that if I were you. This may not be a gun but I can still do you a considerable amount of harm.
Never mind about all that. What is it you're doing here? What are you up to?
Just leave that, shall we?
Then we'll both go. I'll open the door, then I can keep an eye on you.
Oh, isn't it? Why not?
Oh, yes, I see, I see. First, you want to open the door, then you want the chance to reverse the position with the help of whoever it is outside? Secondly, you want to get me into a monk's habit so that whoever that is, would recognise me as an imposter.
Yes, and you can drop the monk's act.
Yes, very well, if you have another cloak with the same type of cowl? Proceed.
And remember, no more monkery!
Wait there and be quiet.
What is the meaning of this, sir! What
What?
This is no way to treat a man in my position.
My dear man, you had me quite worried. I thought you were never coming in.
There you are, my dear fellow. I knew you'd come back. Now, which fires? What are they for?
I repeat my question. Which fires and what are they for?
I see.
Well? Out with it!
So that's it! You're a time meddler! No wonder you wanted to get rid of me. And what are you trying to get up to this time?
Are you quite mad? You know as well as I do the golden rule about space and time travelling. Never, never interfere with the course of history.
Is that so?
And what mischief are you up to now?
Oh, is that so?
By wiping out the Viking fleet?
So you plan to save him the journey?
Oh, yes, it's quite a plan. It's quite a plan, yes. I count myself a very fortunate person indeed, to be here, in time to prevent this disgusting exhibition!
Haven't I? Where is this machine?
Where is it?
Oh, so that's it, eh? This horrible block of stone.
A Saxon what?
Yes, quite so.
Now, now, now, don't try and bamboozle me. It so happens that your machine fits into this monastery, but it's sheer luck.
I see. And all this is part of your master plan?
Oh, isn't there now? Well, let's have a look at this great wonder. Yes, well, tell me, how does one exactly get into this sarcophagus? Hammer and chisel?
That's a very good point, my child, indeed, a very good point. I must ask him that myself.
Safe?
Safe? Oh, my dear, of course I'm safe. Good gracious me. I see you found the machine. Keep your eye on that, young man. I thought I'd told you to wait outside the Tardis.
You know, all this is very surprising. That's a Mark 4!
Hmm?
Oh? Forgot? Forgot what, child?
Hmm?
Haven't we now? Oh, I say. Well, I wonder what that's supposed to mean?
Yes, I remember very well, yes. It so happens that I was there at the time. My dear, I may appear a little half witted at times, but I
Oh!
Oh, is that all, my child.
The water cannot affect the Tardis. It won't wash away. It'll still be there when the tide goes down. Now stop fretting, my dear. Well, I must confess, er, I do congratulate you. It's a splendid machine. Although I do note there's been quite a few changes?
Oh, I see, yes, of course. And, er, thereby you can suspend yourself in space with absolute safety.
Mind your own business.
Yes, I regret that we do, but I would say that I am fifty years earlier. Now when are you going to answer my questions?
The reason for this deliberate destruction.
Improve things? Improve things, yes, that's good. Very good. Improve what, for instance?
He'd do what?
Oh, yes, quite so, yes, of course, I do know the medium.
What are we going to do with this fellow? What can we do with this man? He's utterly irresponsible. He wants to destroy the whole pattern of world history.
Oh, quick, quick!
Wide awake, my dear. As a matter of fact, I was just turning over in my mind what we're going to do with this Monk fellow. He won't listen. He's determined to have his own way. He's got to be stopped. He must be stopped!
Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you indeed. Oh, it's a good thing for us that you decided to make a search.
Ah, yes, the Monk, now was he caught?
Yes, yes, no doubt they'll catch up with him and the rest of them. But, that Monk you know, still worries me. I think he's got some tricks left up his sleeve.
Oh, we shall continue with our travels.
Oh, yes, certainly, certainly, but we have one or two things to do here at the monastery first. But, we don't want to delay you. We'll follow on.
What a charming woman. Charming. Well now, you two, come along. We've got a lot to do.
You know we can't do that, my child, not until we stop this time meddler. Have either of you got a pencil and paper on you?
Well now, be a good fellow and go into the machine and try and find one.
Hmm?
To the Monk, of course. Who else?
Oh! Mr. Taylor! Where are you with that string, dear boy?
Good gracious me, come along.
Now keep your nose out, my child, never mind. Did you hear what I said? Keep your nose away. Do you want to get a shock? This is a very dangerous business. Now keep still, all of you. Tie this in a knot.
Now, the vibrations. Ticklish. Get back, get back! Now, you two, go outside. I'll follow in a minute.
Don't, please, ask me questions. Go child! Outside!
Now, back. Elbow room, please. Now keep still. We're not out of the wood yet.
Ah, there it is! I've done it, I've done it, I've done it.
Hasn't it? Hasn't it, my dear boy?
Yes, sometime, my dear, sometime. Here, put that in your pocket. Quite safe.
Yes, and
Keep your hands off it, young lady. I don't want you nosing into peoples personal and private correspondence. Gracious me. Well, I think we've finished here. Now, lets go.
Yes, certainly, back to the Tardis. Yes, come along.
There it is, my dear. There's the Tardis. Safe and sound. Didn't I tell you so?
Oh, glad indeed. Well, we must start climbing down the cliff and get aboard as soon as we can. There's going to be an invasion shortly.
Yes, my boy, yes. And history will be
Allowed to take its natural course.
Yes, and both very welcome ones, my dear. Come along, come along. Come on, come on.

Yes of course.
Yes, of course.
Thank you. Good grief.
Thank you. Well, it's travelling faster than light.
Why indeed, Professor Tyler, why indeed.
Yes. Pass me a silicon rod will you?
Lightning? Yes, I suppose it could look like lightning, only it isn't. No. If there where such a thing I would say it was compressed light. A sort of controlled superlucent emission.
Tell me, Professor, is this machine of yours functioning properly?
Then I suggest that you do so immediately and let me know the result of your findings. Jo, you and I are going to take a look at the scene of the crime.
I think you'll find everything you need here.
You haven't seen your husband since this morning?
No. No, it's not important.
Yes, Jo. Yes, it's much more important than I thought.
Right, let's see what Doctor Tyler's found out about that plate.
Jo! Back slowly away behind the car. Do as I say!
When I tell you to run, you run. Right, run!
I don't know.
Right, Come on.
No, you wouldn't, Brigadier.
A flash, yes, not an explosion. It was a release of kinetic energy.
No. I shouldn't go anywhere near it. Not just at the moment.
I suggest that you put a guard on the drains, Benton.
Yes, the drains!
All right, Brigadier. Now then, what's the situation as you see it?
Yes, I was rather afraid that might happen.
Well, I shouldn't bother going on looking for him, Brigadier. I think you'll find that that's Mister Ollis.
Yes, that's right.
Nothing's been moved?
Excuse me a minute, will you?
All right, Brigadier, go on.
Thank you. It looks as if Tyler was right. That light beam or whatever it is, seems to have scanned the Earth like a searchlight and picked on us.
Huh? Oh, yes. Well, Brigadier, now Bessie has disappeared.
Well, some kind of powerful organism thing with a very strong hunting instinct.
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.
Oh, I don't know. Well, perhaps this thing was confused, or its instructions weren't getting through.
Tyler? Yeah. Yes, that was its second mistake, here in this laboratory where I usually work. And its third mistake was Bessie.
Yes.
Yes, I do. I think that that beam was the method it used to get here.
We don't find it, Brigadier. If we wait around here long enough, it'll find us.
Obviously from the same source as that organism thing. First the scout, then the reinforcements.
Not much point in my going anywhere else is there?
I think you ought to get out of here too, Jo.
Now please, Jo, do as I ask. They won't harm you. You ignore them, they'll ignore you. I'm the one they're after.
Sergeant Benton. Just the man I wanted to see. Will you please take Miss Grant with you? Even if you have to carry her.
Your orders, Sergeant
Into the Tardis, quickly!
Right, force field on.
Well, Sergeant, aren't you going to say it that it's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Everybody else does.
Oh, thank you for the complement.
It's not reacting. There's only one thing for it. I'll have to send an SOS. I hate having to call them, but, there we are.
I was planning to lure that stuff away from Earth, Jo, but now as it seems to have immobilised the Tardis, I'm not going anywhere. We're trapped.
At least we can watch that thing in comfort, and then we can send in a report and see what they have to say about it.
Yes, they are.
That's odd. Nobody touched anything did they?
But you heard it though, didn't you?
No, I don't think so. Hello, what's this?
It seems strangely familiar. Is it yours, Jo?
Well, properly speaking it's a recorder.
Thank you.
I was wondering where that had got too.
You haven't been trying to play this have you? Oh. I can see you've been doing the Tardis up a bit. Hmm. I don't like it.
Oh my word.
Oh dear, we are in trouble, aren't we. Just as well I turned up.
Now don't tell me. Corporal Benton, isn't it?
How do you do, my dear fellow.
I haven't seen you since that nasty business with the Cybermen.
Well it's a bit difficult to explain, Jo.
Well, not so much one of them as one of us. One of me to be precise.
Oh no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, my dear, I hate to be contrary but I can see he's a little bit confused, poor old chap, and I do feel you should have the correct explanation. You don't mind, do you.
Yes.
I didn't think you would. You see, Jo. I may call you Jo, mayn't I? You see, he is one of me.
Well quite. Well, not quite.
Not, not just Time Lords. We're the same Time Lord.
Now please, you're only confusing my assistant. Jo, it's all quite simple. I am he and he is me.
What?
Oh, how does it go?
Oh, please be quiet.
Yes, yes, I'm afraid so.
Yes, that's what I'd like to know. You've got no right to be here.
Perhaps
What about the First Law of Time?
Perhaps I could explain?
Perhaps you could.
Well, our fellow Time Lords out there are just as much under siege as we are.
What?
And they couldn't send anyone to help you. But they did summon up enough temporal energy to lift me out of my bit of our time stream and pop me down here, into my own future, so to speak.
Why?
My dear fellow, you are being a bit dim, aren't you? Your effectiveness is now doubled!
Halved, more like.
Now, now. There's no need to be ungracious. Suppose we have a look at our problem, shall we? Er, you don't mind, do you?
Oh, be my guest.
Oh, thank you.
Dear old Lethbridge Stewart. Still blazing away as usual.
They'll be all right as long as they keep out of its way. Right, now you can see our problem, can't you.
Yes. Most unpleasant. They are very worried, you know.
Yes, and so am I. I think perhaps I ought to put you in the picture.
Right.
Contact.
Contact.
I see. So it's after you, or should I say us?
That's right. And as they can't help us, we'll just have to help ourselves.
Twinkle, twinkle little star.
Must you?
Are we going to take this attitude to my music all the time?
Yes, I'm rather afraid we are.
Well, you've been fiddling with it, haven't you?
It was perfectly all right until you touched it. Now if only you'd leave things to me.
If we were to leave things with you, my dear fellow, we'd be in a fine pickle, wouldn't we.
Look, you lost the image, not me.
I did not loose the image!
I set this thing up
What?
[on scanner] Ah, there you are. I seem to be stuck up here. Hmm? Hmm? Oh, so you're my replacements. Huh. A dandy and a clown. Have you done anything?
Well, we've, er, assessed the situation.
Just as I thought. Nothing.
Well it's not easy, you know.
It's not as if we know what that stuff is.
No.
Then I'll tell you. It's a time bridge.
It's a what?
I see.
Now, what's a bridge for, eh?
Well, er
Crossing?
Right. So stop dilly-dallying and cross it!
No! No wait!
You faded him again.
I did not fade him. You saw
Yes, you certainly did.
Me. Me!
Call, will you?
Heads.
Hard luck.
All right. Stand by to disconnect the force field.
Now!
Jo, get back!
Steady now, Sergeant. He knows what he's doing. At least I hope he does.
Yes, it's a pity she ran after him like that. Let's have a look, shall we?
As far as I can see, that stuff's gone to a great deal of trouble to find me, er, him, so whoever or whatever it was that sent it can't merely want to kill him. No, no, they've been transported somewhere.
No, wait a minute. Do you know, Sergeant, I think our friend has gone off the boil, so to speak.
No, I think we could try a more subtle approach. Let's turn off the force field and open the doors first, shall we?
Wait a minute. Let me go first.
Hmm. Awaiting further instructions, I would think.
It's all right. I think it was just hiccups. Fascinating.
No, no, Brigadier. Leave it alone. It's not dangerous for the moment. It seems to think it's achieved its mission.
Oh, yes.
How are you, Brigadier?
There you are. It's all quite simple really.
Of course I am. You can see that.
Had I really? How fascinating.
It's no use your asking me about all this, Brigadier. As far as I'm concerned, it hasn't happened yet. Don't you see? I'm just a temporal anomaly.
Well, I'll do my best, but I can't make any promises.
Oh, I don't think that'd do any good. At the moment they're far from being all-powerful. That's why it's been left up to me and me and me.
Jo? Jo? Can you hear me? Jo, wake up.
Are you all right?
Jo.
This is a place. It's just like any other place. Well, almost. We've been brought here. Anyway, it's not much like heaven, is it. Come on, let's go and take a look around.
So wherever they are, Miss Grant and my other self, we can't contact them. That's the problem with antimatter. You can see the effect but never the cause. It's like being punched on the nose by the invisible man.
The invisible man. Antimatter.
Yes, that's right.
Yes. Awkward, isn't it? As far as I can see, there's only one explanation.
Well, this stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate, isn't it.
Oh, I wouldn't say that. We can make sure it stays harmless for a start.
Keep it confused. Feed it with useless information. I wonder if I have a television set handy.
That's odd.
Yes.
Well, that's the Brigadier's computer.
Look, this is the lab door.
Well, it says No Admittance.
Yes. Well, we both know what that is, don't we?
Er, Jo, do you see what I see?
That clinches it. We have been transported, and so has all this stuff. Come on.
Right. All we've got to do is find out where we are and who brought us here.
Where to?
Right.
Man Friday, would you believe?
Come on.
It's quite like old time, eh, Sergeant?
Hmm? Oh, nearly ready for testing.
Now steady on, Sergeant.
Oh, no.
But won't they think it strange? I mean, me?
His what!
Well, I've just set this thing up! Now I won't be able to confuse it!
Yes, as quiet as a lamb. We've got it thoroughly subdued, haven't we, Sergeant.
Oh, very well. Here you are, Sergeant, you'll need this. Now if it gives the slightest trouble, a little dose of that will settle it.
Then give it the lot! Come on, Brigadier.
What is it? Oh!
Into the Tardis, quickly! Come on, Brigadier!
Yes, it's quite cozy, isn't it? Oh, you'll soon get used to it, old chap. Relative dimensions and all that.
Oh, no, no, no. They come like this. Really.
Yes, it is, isn't it.
Oh, we have a think. Care for a jelly baby?
It's Doctor Tyler. Doctor Tyler!
Yes. We're at the other end of that light streak of yours.
We've been transported along it.
Yes, exactly. That's where we are. On a stable world in a universe of antimatter. An anomaly within an impossibility.
Well, here we are. Kidnapped and marooned. But by whom?
Well, these things sound very much like the creatures that attacked us at UNIT HQ.
What exactly did they look like?
Run!
Yes, it is, isn't it. My little plan seems to have misfired. I seem to have accentuated its metabolic rate
Most unfortunate. It shouldn't have happened. Now, what went wrong?
The beam should have desensitised. Of course, you fool. It's antimatter! The opposite effect! Instead of quietening down, I've stimulated it.
You haven't seen my recorder anywhere, have you? It's a little thing about this long with holes in. I had it when I came in and I put it down somewhere and I can't find it.
There's no point.
Brigadier, I cannot open that door without first turning off the force field, and even if I did, you'd never make it across the floor. That thing out there has become a killer. It's my fault and I'm sorry.
All we can do now is think, and I think best to music. Now, where is my recorder?
It's the entrance to some sort of palace, I should imagine.
I've no idea, but I expect we'll soon find out.
What?
You're wasting your time. You'll never get through with the force field on.
Let's have a look at this thing.
I'll try to set you up a communications unit.
It's all right. Don't worry. I can boost this through the Tardis's communication circuit. I think.
Are you still worried about your other Doctor, Sergeant?
Well, I shouldn't worry too much if I were you. In fact, I rather envy them.
Yes, I think they're having a very interesting time.
My dear Doctor Tyler, I don't want to get out. I want to meet our host. I allowed myself to be brought here for that very purpose.
Don't you understand? You were both brought here by accident. Your only chance of getting back lies in my persuading whoever brought you here to send you home.
Doctor Tyler, you're not going anywhere.
I refuse to allow you to endanger all our lives.
Tyler! Tyler, come back! Tyler!
Idiot. He'll jeopardise the entire operation.
Yes.
Yes, that's right, Jo. I'm the one they're after. I'm sure I can persuade our host to send you back.
Jo, we're dealing here with a creature of great intelligence, and superior intelligence and senseless cruelty just do not go together.
Tyler! Come on, get up. Up, up. Are you all right?
Here we are, Brigadier. Have a try with that. It's all right, it won't bite you.
Hmm?
Oh, excuse me.
Made any progress?
No, none at all. And you?
Hardly. I'm trapped in this infernal time eddy.
What about our fellow Time Lords?
Growing steadily weaker. They can't seem to check their energy loss.
We can't help you, I'm afraid.
Oh yes, you could.
Oh? How?
Well, first turn off your force field.
What? But I don't
Off, I said.
But I still don't see
Oh, use your intelligence.
I'm afraid you'd never believe me.
That's right.
Yes, well, our bodies have been converted, processed in some ways, so that we can exist here.
Yes, exactly.
But things aren't always as they seem, you know, Doctor Tyler. Now, you take this pencil, for example.
Ah, but is it? Watch very, very closely.
Or is it a bunch of flowers?
Yes, that's exactly what this place is, a scientific conjuring trick of a very high order. I think the waiting is over.
Yes, I think so.
Because he told me to, and I've always had a great respect for his advice.
Precisely! Hold tight, everyone.
Yes, most impressive, I must admit that.
Who are you?
Omega? But that's impossible. Omega was destroyed.
Where are you taking them?
You knew your mission was dangerous.
You were the solar engineer. It was your duty.
Well, you succeeded, and are revered for it.
The histories say that you were lost in the supernova.
No, not forgotten. All my life I've known of you and honoured you as our greatest hero.
Well, theoretically, of course, all this is quite impossible.
Thank you. Tell me, how did you manage to survive?
And this organism stuff that you sent to bring us here?
But how do I fit into this picture?
Oh, I see.
And if I give you my help, do you really think you can defeat the Time Lords? All of them?
And if I refuse to cooperate?
Them?
Well, we appear to have arrived.
I don't think you'll get through with that thing.
It hasn't quite got the range.
Brigadier
I think you should prepare yourself for a bit of a shock.
We can try.
Well, I never.
I really wouldn't advise it.
Oh, all right. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, I do wish you'd listen to me. Come along, we'd better follow him.
That's extraordinary. That stuff must have found the Tardis a bit indigestible even without the force field on, so it swallowed a bit of the surrounding matter as well. Hmm. Rather like taking a pill with a swig of water.
Oh, I'm quite sure we have.
Not where he thinks we are.
I rather think we all have. What's it like out there?
Oh, splendid. Who's for a swim?
I'm afraid we're a little bit further than that, Brigadier.
Oh, please, if you'd only listen to me.
Dear oh dear oh dear.
Yes, I suppose we better had. Just a minute. I think I'll have another look for my recorder.
Oh, no, I'm sure it's in the Tardis somewhere. I shan't be a minute.
Oh my giddy aunt!
Oh!
Look, if you cannot reverse the energy drain, the fabric of the entire universe could be torn apart.
Then you would be utterly alone forever.
Omega, if you would undo the harm that you've done and resume your place on the High Council, you could have the freedom to do anything that you wished.
Oh, just some more innocent bystanders. Probably scooped up by that bungling organism of yours. Send them back, Omega. They can do you no harm.
And it has done so.
Appearances aren't everything, you know.
I really think you're making a mistake, you know.
I was out for a stroll with my friend here when this horrible great jelly
Now, Omega
(sotto) Is it really him? Omega?
(sotto) Yes, I'm afraid so.
I tell you, I practically had him won over then you turned up and he started treating me like an imposter.
Well, you are really, aren't you.
What do you mean?
Well, I suppose in another way we both are. Or is it neither of us?
Look, for heaven's sake, stop twittering on.
There's no need to be offensive!
I'm not being offensive. The important thing is
Yes, well, all right, I'm sorry. Perhaps I did speak a trifle sharply.
Yes, well, I'm sorry, too. Well, what did you think of this chap Omega?
Frankly, I thought he was somewhat confused.
Me.
Oh, ask Jo, there's a good chap. You see, one minute he was talking about destroying everything
Yes.
The next minute he's talking about freedom.
The phenomenon of singularity.
Look, you explain to him. You're far better at it than I am.
Oh, no, no, please. Older and wiser head.
Yes, well, it does exist. Right here, I'm afraid.
Well, singularity is a point in space time which can exist only inside a black hole. We are in a black hole, in a world of antimatter very close to this point of singularity, where all the known physical laws cease to exist. Now, Omega has got control of singularity and has learned to use the vast forces locked up inside the black hole.
Now, that is how Omega is able to create the world we are now living in by a fantastic effort of his will, but unfortunately he thinks he's been wronged by the Time Lords.
Yes, and now he's hell bent on revenge.
Well, the trouble is, we're not sure we can.
A Time Lord. One of the greatest of all my race.
Our race.
Our race. Yes, sorry.
Long, long ago, we learnt the secret of time travel, but in order to make it a reality we had to have a colossal source of energy.
Omega provided that energy by a fantastic feat of solar engineering. We thought he was destroyed, instead of which he finished up here.
Yes, it seems that his imprisonment was the price of our freedom to travel in time.
Yes, that's true.
No, that's useless in this world. The only natural law here is the law of Omega's will.
Yes.
That might work. It just might.
It's worth a try.
Yes.
Right.
Right.
Ready?
Ready.
Contact.
Contact.
Well done.
I couldn't possibly have done it without you. Well, what next?
Now for the singularity chamber. That's the key to it all.
Splendid. Come on.
Come on.
Jo, you wait there.
It even opens!
Well, shall we?
The bull by the horns, eh?
All right.
Well, after you.
Let's toss, shall we?
What would be the point?
Singularity.
Fascinating.
By combining our wills against yours.
Together we were able to break down your barriers, so you're not all powerful after all, Omega.
If you free us, we'll plead your cause to the Time Lords. Otherwise we shall combine our wills to destroy you.
Yes, if I must.
Well, what do you want now?
In?
Well, better than being stuck here, I suppose. All right.
No, Omega! Destroy him and you'll destroy your only chance of freedom.
Thank you, Omega. A most interesting demonstration.
But our friends do not defy you!
All this exists because you have willed singularity to create it all for you.
I say, you mean all you've got to do is think of a thing, rub your magic lamp over there and shally me gally me zoop, there it is? That's jolly clever. That's jolly clever.
You couldn't run me up a quick recorder, could you? It's a little thing about this long with holes in. I've lost mine, you see.
It's not much to ask, a small recorder!
Please, ignore him. Just ignore him. He's incorrigibly frivolous.
Just because you're not musical!
Please! Will you stop interrupting? Continue.
It's not a pipe!
(sotto) What the hell do you think you're trying to do?
(sotto) Testing the limits of his self control. They're not very good, are they.
(sotto) No. No, they're not, but it'll be dangerous if you push him too far.
(sotto) We'll have to risk that. That temper is his only weakness.
No, no. I was just explaining to my associate here that he should show you more respect, for both our sakes.
I am thoroughly repentant. You mentioned some task.
But surely, if you can transmit matter to Earth down that light stream, you could transmit yourself anywhere.
But why?
So, the moment you abandon control, you cannot escape, and you cannot escape without abandoning control.
We will obey you, Omega.
We have no choice.
We, we cannot remove the mask, Omega, because.
Because beneath that mask there is nothing left of you. The corrosion has already done its work.
You exist only because your will insists that you exist. Your will is all that is left of you.
But don't you see? You can only exist here!
I told you he'd got no self control.
Come on, out!
That's funny. I could have sworn I left Bessie here.
You did, old chap. The tracks are leading that way.
That's Jo and Benton.
They'll be making for UNIT Headquarters.
What?
Come on! Let's get a move on.
Tardis, everybody! Into the Tardis, quickly!
Come on, inside. Come on, Brigadier. Inside, inside!
Right, force field on.
Force field's on.
Well, there you are, then. They can't get in
And we can't get out.
We're besieged.
If only I could find my recorder, I could play you a little something to pass the time.
Nobble him? You're talking about one of the most powerful blokes in the cosmos. Nobble him?
Well, I. Excuse me. Someone's trying to get through to us.
You don't think? (points up)
I hardly think so.
There you are, then. What's all this, a mass meeting?
Well, we had to bring them all in here. It wasn't safe outside.
In a pretty pickle, aren't you. Yes, trapped in your own Tardis!
You're trapped in your own bubble. You can talk.
Unfortunately, talk's all I can do, and not much of that. The transference isn't stable. Let's get on with it, eh?
On with what?
Putting our heads together and finding a solution. Ready?
Ready.
Ready.
Contact.
Contact.
We're all agreed, then. Risky, but it could work. I'll report back.
We'd have to strip down the force field.
But that'd mean leaving the Tardis defenceless.
Yes, I know, but I think we'll have to risk it.
It's worth a try. Come on!
Yes, what is it?
We think we've found a way of dealing with Omega.
Later, old chap. If there's still time.
How do we know that he'll take the generator? What if he should refuse?
Ah, I've found it.
Found what?
My recorder. It must have been there all the time.
Right in the corner of the force field.
Well, don't touch it.
I wasn't going to.
Don't you understand? It's exactly what we want. Far better than the force field generator.
Oh no, not my recorder!
I'll get you another one. I'll get you a hundred, I'll get you a thousand of them. Come on.
For a while.
There's a possible solution. I'll let you know as soon as I can.
Here we are, then. This should do the trick.
It means, Brigadier, that we can now strike a bargain with our friend Omega.
This box of tricks, as you call it, is a kind of portable force field.
And the recorder is considerably more than just a recorder.
Yes. Right, ready?
Here, if you'd just hold this.
Right, switch on.
On.
Omega, we want to talk with you.
We think we have discovered a way to give you back your freedom. Will you now free the Tardis so that we can come to you?
No, not a bit of it, old chap. We just want to avoid a long, tiring walk, that's all.
Right. Now listen to me, everybody. From now on you are to do exactly as you are told.
Now, Jo, please do as I ask. Do exactly as I tell you. Do you promise?
Good. Are you ready? Stand by. Here we go.
We have come to set you free.
On one condition.
Omega, if you will send these people back to where they came from, we will stay and help you.
We think we have devised a way of restoring your freedom to you.
We shall give you that promise, Omega. We will not attempt to leave this world before you do.
DOCTOR Jo! You promised!
Brigadier, I want all of you to step through that column of smoke.
Don't be alarmed. It won't harm you. On the contrary, it will take you back home.
Please, Brigadier, it's the only way.
Yes, of course I'm sure.
Jo, please.
Trust me.
You'll be all right.
You are wrong, Omega. You can have your freedom. It is here.
The only freedom you can ever have. Take it. Take it, Omega.
Take it!
Run!
Come on, quick!
I told you he had no self-control, didn't I?
By the skin of our teeth.
Where's Mister Ollis?
Where's Mister Ollis?
Oh, back where he came from, I imagine.
So there you are. Omega's will was like the tension in the elastic. Once that will was broken, all the bits of Earth, UNIT etc just snapped back right into their proper place.
Because that was the proper place for us.
Well, as you know, it accidentally fell into the force field of the Tardis, so that when we were all transformed into antimatter, that was the only thing that wasn't processed.
And when Omega knocked it out of our hands and it fell out of the force field, all the atoms and the anti-atoms annihilated one another.
Exactly.
Pity, though. I think it had a lovely tone.
Everything okay?
Well, here we are, back safe and sound.
Quite a party.
Yes, well, the party's over now. You young men and I go back to our time zones. Though considering the way things have been going, well, I shudder to think what you'll do with out me.
Goodbye. Well, goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. It's been so nice to meet me.
Yes, I see what you mean. I hope I don't meet me again.
Ah.
Yes, wasn't I?
Goodbye.
Yes, for us.
I didn't exactly trick him. I promised him his freedom and I gave it to him. The only freedom he could ever have.
The Time Lords! Look, they've sent me a new dematerialisation circuit. And my knowledge of time travel law and all the dematerialisation codes, they've all come back. They've forgiven me. They've given me back my freedom.
No, not straight away, Jo. Of course not. I've got to build a new force field generator first.

Sapphire waterfall. It's a waterfall made of sapphires.
This enormous jewel, the size of a glacier
Reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion, and then shatters into sapphires at the edge. They fall a hundred thousand feet into a crystal ravine.
Oh, come on. They're boarding now. It's no fun if I see it on me own. Four hours, that's all it takes.
You be careful, that's Xtonic sunlight.
All right, I give up.
I'll be back for dinner. We'll try that anti-gravity restaurant. With bibs.
See you later.
Nah.
Taking a big space truck with a bunch of strangers across a diamond planet called Midnight? What could possibly go wrong?
That'll be the peanuts.
Oh, I can't wait. Allons-y.
It's French, for let's go.
I'm the Doctor. Hello.
Oh. My first.
Oh.
Tell you what. We'll have to talk to each other instead.
And you were wearing a nose plug.
And did they ever find it?
The Lost Moon of Poosh.
Well. Maybe that'll be your great discovery, one day. Here's to Poosh.
No, no, I'm with this friend of mine, Donna. She stayed behind in the Leisure Palace. You?
Oh, I've done plenty of that. Travelling on my own. I love it. Do what you want, go anywhere.
What happened?
Yeah. I had a friend who went to a different universe.
I think it's both.
He's got a point, though.
There you go. Engine expert. Two ticks.
Company insurance. Let's see if we can get an early assessment. So, what's the problem, Driver Joe?
Er, no, because that's the engine feed, that line there, and it's fine. And it's a micropetrol engine, so stabilising doesn't really make sense, does it? Sorry. I'm the Doctor, I'm very clever. So, what's wrong?
Yeah, you're right. No faults. And who are you?
Nice to meet you.
How long till they get here?
Well, since we're waiting, shall we take a look outside? Just lift the screens a bit?
Nah. Those windows are Finitoglass. They'd give you a couple of minutes. Go on, live a little.
Oh, that is beautiful.
Joe, you said we took a detour?
Is that a recognised path?
So we're the first. This piece of ground. No one's ever been here before. Not in the whole of recorded history.
What did you see?
What sort of shadow?
Where? What was it?
Running which way?
Oh, just stabilising. Happens all the time.
Well. Bit of flim-flam. Don't worry, they're sorting it out.
It's just a little pause, that's all.
Professor, it's fine.
Nothing.
Everyone! Quiet! Thank you. Now, if you'd care to listen to my good friend Dee Dee.
There you go. And I've spoken to the Captain. I can guarantee you everything's fine.
Knock, knock.
Hello?
Mister Cane. Better not.
All right, all right, all right. Everyone calm down.
Get out of there!
Arms, legs, neck, head, nose. I'm fine. Everyone else? How are we?
How are we? Everyone all right?
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's over. We're still alive. Look, the wall's still intact. Do you see?
We're safe.
Ah, that's better. Little bit of light. Thank you. Molto bene.
No, it's safe. Any rupture would automatically seal itself.
But something sliced it off. You're right, the cabin's gone.
It loses integrity. I'm sorry, they've been reduced to dust. The driver and the mechanic. But they sent a distress signal. Help is on its way. They saved our lives. We are going to get out of here, I promise. We're still alive, and they are going to find us.
Right. Yes. Sorry. Have we got a medical kit?
What's her name?
Sky? Can you hear me? Are you all right? Can you move, Sky? Just look at me.
Sky? It's all right, Sky. I just want you to turn around, face me.
Sky?
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
You don't have to talk.
I'm trying to help.
My name's the Doctor.
Okay, can you stop?
I'd like you to stop.
Shush, shush, shush, all of you.
Jethro, leave it. Just shut up.
Why are you repeating?
What is that, learning?
Copying?
Absorbing?
The square root of pi is 1.772453850905516027298167483341. Wow.
Now, just stop it, all of you.
I know.
I think you should all be very, very quiet. Have you got that?
Mrs Cane, please be quiet.
Just stop it, all of you. Stop it, please. Now then, Sky. Are you Sky? Is Sky still in there? Mrs Silvestry? You know exactly what I'm going to say. How are you doing that? Roast beef. Bananas. The Medusa Cascade. Bang! Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, Tardis. Shamble bobble dibble dooble. Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome. Yes, I am, thank you. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. First she repeats, then she catches up. What's the next stage?
I don't think so, no. I think the more we talk, the more she learns. Now, I'm all for education, but in this case, maybe not. Let's just move back. Come on. Come with me. Everyone, get back. All of you, as far as you can.
Val, come with me. Come to the back. Stop looking at her. Come on, Jethro. You too. Everyone, come on. Fifty minutes, that's all we need. Fifty minutes till the rescue arrives. And she's not exactly strong. Look at her. All she's got is our voices.
It's a poem. Christina Rossetti.
Actually, I don't think that's helping.
Professor, I'm glad you've got an absolute definition of life in the universe, but perhaps the universe has got ideas of its own, hmm? Now trust me, I've got previous. I think there might well be some consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry, but maybe she's still in there. And it's our job to help her.
No, I've got to stay back, because if she's copying us, then maybe the final stage is becoming us. I don't want her becoming me, or things could get a whole lot worse.
As it happens, yes, I am. So that's decided. We stay back, and we wait. When the rescue ship comes, we can get her to hospital.
Don't be ridiculous.
She can't even move.
No one is getting thrown out.
Thanks, Dee Dee. Just what we needed.
No one is killing anyone.
Now, listen, all of you. For all we know that's a brand new life form over there. And if it's come inside to discover us, than what's it found? This little bunch of humans. What do you amount to, murder? Because this is where you decide. You decide who you are. Could you actually murder her? Any of you? Really? Or are you better than that?
What?
You can't say that.
That's not what I said.
You'll be safe any minute now. The rescue truck is on its way.
No, because when we get back to the base, I'll be there to contain it.
At last. Thank you.
Don't make it a third. Jethro, what do you say?
Thank you.
There isn't a vote. It's not happening. Ever. If you try to throw her out that door, you'll have to get past me first.
Oh, now you're being stupid. Just think about it. Could you actually take hold of someone and throw them out of that door?
I'm just travelling. I'm a traveller, that's all.
Just Donna. Just my friend.
Oh, Jethro, not you.
All right, I'm interested. Yes, I can't help it. Because whatever's inside her, it's brand new, and that's fascinating.
No.
I was just talking.
That was after.
Because I'm clever!
That's not what I meant.
Oh come on, just listen to yourself, please.
Look, just. Right, sorry, yes, hold on, just. I know you're scared, and so am I. Look at me, I am. But we have all got to calm down and cool off and think.
What does it matter?
John Smith.
Now listen to me. Listen to me right now, because you need me, all of you. If we are going to get out of this, then you need me.
When did she? No, she hasn't. She's still doing it.
Sky, what are you doing?
Why me? Why are you doing this?
I don't know. Sky, stop it. I said stop it. Just stop it.
Mrs Silvestry, I'm trying to understand. You've captured my speech. What for? What do you need? You need my voice in particular. The cleverest voice in the room. Why? Because I'm the only one who can help? Oh, I'd love that to be true, but your eyes, they're saying something else. Listen to me. Whatever you want, if it's life, or form, or consciousness, or voice, you don't have to steal it. You can find it without hurting anyone. And I'll help you. That's a promise. So, what do you think?
Do we have a deal?
Oh, look at that. I'm ahead of you.
I think it's moved.
I think it's letting me go.
Yes. Yes, it's me.
I'm coming back
Listen. It's me.
Look at me.
I can move. I can feel again.
I'm coming back to life.
And look at him. He can't move.
Help me.
Professor?
Get me away from him.
Please.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, it was so cold.
I couldn't breathe.
I'm sorry.
I must have scared you so much.
It's inside his head.
It killed the driver.
And the mechanic.
And now it wants us.
He's waited so long.
In the dark.
And the cold.
And the diamonds.
Until you came.
Bodies so hot.
With blood.
And pain.
That's how he does it.
He makes you fight.
Creeps into your head.
And whispers.
Listen.
Just listen.
That's him.
Inside.
Yes.
Throw him out.
Get rid of him.
Now.
Cast him out.
Into the sun.
And the night.
Do it.
Do it now.
Faster.
That's the way.
You can do it.
Molto bene.
Allons-y.
The starlight waits.
The emptiness.
The Midnight sky.
It's gone. It's gone. It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone, it's gone, it's gone. It's gone, it's gone, it's gone.
The hostess. What was her name?
No idea.
Yeah. They can build a Leisure Palace somewhere else. Let this planet keep on turning round an Xtonic star, in silence.
Molto bene.
No, don't do that. Don't. Don't.

Wrong. Wrong. Bit right, mostly wrong. I love museums.
Amy, this isn't any old asteroid. It's the Delerium Archive, the final resting place of the headless monks. The biggest museum ever.
Wrong. Very wrong. Ooo, one of mine. Also one of mine.
It's from one of the old starliners. A Home Box.
Like a black box on a plane, except it homes. Anything happens to the ship, the Home Box flies home with all the flight data.
The writing, the graffiti. Old High Gallifreyan. The lost language of the Time Lords.
There were days, there were many days, these words could burn stars and raise up empires, and topple gods.
Hello, sweetie.
Because someone on a spaceship twelve thousand years ago is trying to attract my attention. Let's see if we can get the security playback working.
Coordinates.
Whoo!
River?
I'm trying.
There aren't any stabilisers.
Oh, the blue ones don't do anything, they're just blue.
Yeah. Well, it's just boring now, isn't it? They're boring-ers. They're blue boring-ers.
You call that flying the Tardis? Ha!
Parked us? We haven't landed.
But, it didn't make the noise.
You know, the (wheezing).
Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Come along, Pond. Let's have a look.
Oh yes, sorry. Quite right. Environment checks.
Nice out.
We're on Alfava Metraxis, the seventh planet of the Dundra System. Oxygen rich atmosphere, all toxins in the soft band, eleven hour day and chances of rain later.
Well, yeah.
They didn't land.
You should've checked the Home Box. It crashed.
It's a long story and I don't know most of it. Off we go.
Leaving. She's got where she wants to go, let's go where we want to go.
Yep.
Because she's the future. My future.
I can run away from anything I like. Time is not the boss of me.
Yes, of course it's a planet.
Okay, five minutes.
But that's all, because I'm telling you now, that woman is not dragging me into anything.
Nah, the airlock would've sealed seconds after you blew it. According to the Home Box, the warp engines had a phase shift. No survivors.
About what?
Amy Pond, Professor River Song.
I'm nobody's taxi service. I'm not going to be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a space ship.
Stay away from it.
Her diary.
Her past, my future. Time travel. We keep meeting in the wrong order.
Oh, good.
Catacombs. Probably dark ones. Dark catacombs. Great.
You can stop any time you like.
Now that's interesting. You're still here. Which part of wait in the Tardis till I tell you it's safe was so confusing?
A Weeping Angel, Amy, is the deadliest, most powerful, most malevolent life form evolution has ever produced, and right now one of them is trapped inside that wreckage and I'm supposed to climb in after it with a screwdriver and a torch, and assuming I survive the radiation long enough and assuming the whole ship doesn't explode in my face, do something incredibly clever which I haven't actually thought of yet. That's my day. That's what I'm up to. Any questions?
Yes, you're right. I am definitely Mister Grumpy Face today.
He's their Bishop, they're his Clerics. It's the fifty first Century. The Church has moved on.
Yeah, it's an Angel. Hands covering its face.
Once, on Earth, a long time ago. But those were scavengers, barely surviving.
Where did it come from?
There's a difference between dormant and patient.
No, it's not legend, it's a quantum lock. In the sight of any living creature the Angels literally cease to exist. They're just stone. The ultimate defence mechanism.
Being a stone until you turn your back.
The hyperdrive would've split on impact. That whole ship's going to be flooded with drive burn radiation, cracked electrons, gravity storms. Deadly to almost any living thing.
Dinner to an Angel. The longer we leave it there, the stronger it will grow. Who built that temple? Are they still around?
Whoo! You lot, you're everywhere. You're like rabbits. I'll never get done saving you.
Oh, there is. Bad as it gets. Bishop, lock and load.
Sweetie?
Not bad. Bit slow in the middle. Didn't you hate his girlfriend? No. No, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
This book is wrong. What's wrong with this book? It's wrong.
Very early.
How do you know who I am? I don't always look the same.
Pictures. Why aren't there pictures?
This whole book, it's a warning about the Weeping Angels, so why no pictures? Why not show us what to look out for?
Yes. Hang on. (reads) That which holds the image of an angel becomes itself an angel.
Amy!
Are you all right? What's happening?
Doctor? Doctor, it's coming out of the television.
Don't take your eyes off it. Keep looking. It can't move if you're looking.
Deadlocked.
Don't blink, Amy. Don't even blink.
Cutting the power. It's using the screen, I'm turning the screen off. No good, it's deadlocked the whole system.
There is now.
Can you turn it off?
The screen. Can you turn it off?
Try again
But don't take your eyes off the Angel.
Each time it moves, it'll move faster. Don't even blink.
Yeah, it's the Angel.
No, anything that takes the image of an Angel is an Angel. What are you doing?
There is no way in. It's not physically possible.
Just keep looking at it. Don't stop looking.
Amy, not the eyes.
Look at the Angel but don't look at the eyes.
(reads) The eyes are not the windows of the soul. They are the doors. Beware what may enter there.
Don't look at the eyes!
River, hug Amy.
Because I'm busy.
That was a projection of the Angel. It's reaching out, getting a good look at us. It's no longer dormant.
Okay, now it starts.
Do we have a gravity globe?
Well, if you happen to be a creature of living stone
The perfect hiding place.
A bit, yeah.
A needle that looks like hay. A hay-like needle of death. A hay-alike needle of death in a haystack of, er, statues. No, yours was fine.
We find it, and hope.
Sorry, what?
I wasn't listening. I'm busy.
Yeah.
What's your name?
Ah, that's a great name. I love Bob.
Sacred Bob. More like Scared Bob now, eh?
Ah, good. Scared keeps you fast. Anyone in this room who isn't scared is a moron. Carry on.
Had dinner with their Chief Architect once. Two heads are better than one.
No, I mean he had two heads. That book, the very end, what did it say?
Read it to me.
Lovely species, the Aplans. We should visit them some time.
So is Virginia Woolf. I'm on her bowling team. Very relaxed, sort of cheerful. Well, that's having two heads, of course. You're never short of a snog with an extra head.
Yeah, there's something wrong. Don't know what it is yet, either. Working on it. Of course, then they started having laws against self-marrying. I mean, what was that about? But that's the Church for you. Er, no offence, Bishop.
Oh.
Exactly.
Low level perception filter, or maybe we're thick.
Nobody move. Nobody move. Everyone stay exactly where they are. Bishop, I am truly sorry. I've made a mistake and we are all in terrible danger.
So why don't the statues? Everyone, over there. Just move. Don't ask questions, don't speak.
Okay, I want you all to switch off your torches.
Just do it. Okay. I'm going to turn off this one too, just for a moment.
No.
They're Angels. All of them.
Clerics, keep watching them.
Every statue in this Maze, every single one, is a Weeping Angel. They're coming after us.
The Aplans. What happened? How did they die out?
We know.
Look at them. They're dying, losing their form. They must have been down here for centuries, starving.
And their image is their power. Power. Power!
Don't you see? All that radiation spilling out the drive burn. The crash of the Byzantium wasn't an accident, it was a rescue mission for the Angels. We're in the middle of an army, and it's waking up.
Bob, Sacred Bob, it's me, the Doctor.
Where are you now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.
Ah, well done, Bob. Scared keeps you fast. Told you, didn't I. Your friends, Bob. What did the Angel do to them?
That's odd. That's not how the Angels kill you. They displace you in time. Unless they needed the bodies for something.
Oh, don't be an idiot. The Angels don't leave you alive. Bob, keep running. But tell me, how did you escape?
What do you mean, the Angel killed you?
If you're dead, how can I be talking to you?
So when you say you're on your way up to us
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming. Just go. Go, go, go. Yeah. Called you an idiot. Sorry, but there's no way we could have rescued your men.
Angel Bob. Which Angel am I talking to? The one from the ship?
Ah, so the Angel is not in the wreckage. Thank you.
Don't wait for me. Go, run.
Why not?
You looked into the eyes of an Angel, didn't you?
Listen to me. It's messing with your head. Your hand is not made of stone.
It's in your mind, I promise you. You can move that hand. You can let go.
The Angel is going to come and it's going to turn this light off, and then there's nothing I can do to stop it, so do it. Concentrate. Move your hand.
Then we're both going to die.
They'll kill the lights.
Time can be re-written. It doesn't work like that.
Keep your eyes on it. Don't blink.
You see, I'm not going. I'm not leaving you here.
You can move your hand.
It's not stone.
Amy Pond, you are magnificent, and I'm sorry.
Oh, no, I'm not leaving you, never. I'm sorry about this.
See? Not stone. Now run.
Yeah, and you're alive.
Yes, and you're alive. Did I mention?
Yeah. Alive. All I'm saying.
Yeah, it's the Angels. They're coming. And they're draining the power for themselves.
Which means we can't stay here.
There's always a way out.
There's always a way out.
Hello, Angels. What's your problem?
Why are you telling me this?
Which is?
I'm sorry?
Well then, the Angels have made their second mistake because I'm not going to let that pass. I'm sorry you're dead, Bob, but I swear to whatever is left of you, they will be sorrier.
Yeah. I'm trapped. And you know what? Speaking of traps, this trap has got a great big mistake in it. A great big, whopping mistake.
Trust me.
Trust me?
You lot, trust me?
Then give me your gun. I'm about to do something incredibly stupid and dangerous. When I do, jump!
Just jump, high as you can. Come on, leap of faith, Bishop. On my signal.
You won't miss it.
Oh, big mistake. Huge. Didn't anyone every tell you there's one thing you never put in a trap? If you're smart, if you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there is one thing you never, ever put in a trap.
Me.

Well, you enjoyed that.
They'd take some adapting.
This is what we came for.
Ah, Professor Clegg. How good of you to come.
Yes, It's my fault entirely. I do apologise. Won't you sit down?
Well, you see, Professor, I'm doing a little research into ESP.
You see, Professor, my particular field covers, er, psycholotry, telepathy and clairvoyance as well, so I thought perhaps you might be able to help me.
You disappoint me, Professor.
Just a word code with your assistant, eh?
Oh, indeed it is, Professor. Indeed it is.
I assure you that I shall tell nobody that you are really a very powerful clairvoyant.
That's your real secret, isn't it?
You made a couple of mistakes last night, Professor. You gave the answer before your assistant had uttered a word.
Physical manifestations? Psychokinesis, for example?
That's remarkable.
A very rarely developed faculty in homo sapiens. Professor? Mister Clegg. Would you give us a demonstration?
Please?
Mister Clegg, your powers may seem to be extraordinary, but I assure you that they lie dormant in everyone. They're perfectly natural.
But that's what my experiment's are all about, Mister Clegg.
Possibly.
Good.
You see, Brigadier, the electrocephalograph will show us his brainwaves on here as we carry out the tests. Right, let's try a little simple psycholotry, shall we? Er, Lethbridge Stewart, my dear fellow, would you like to give Mister Clegg some little article of yours?
Right. Ready when you are, Mister Clegg.
A little too much perhaps, eh, Alastair?
Right, this is what we call the IRIS machine, or Image Reproduction Integrating System. It translates your thoughts into pictures on this monitor here. Try this, will you?
Indeed you are, Professor. Indeed you are.
Now, er, do you feel up to bending the odd fork?
What, from Jo?
Well, let's take a look.
Oh, no, wait a minute. I've got a better idea. Er, Mister Clegg, would you like to tell us what's inside this package?
Brigadier, please.
The crystal from Metebelis Three. Thank you, Mister Clegg. Let's take a look, shall we?
Well, well, well.
And we're at our twenty eighth native village. No, hang about, twenty ninth. Switch on the light for me, Sergeant, will you?
We haven't found our toadstool yet, and we're not likely to if I don't get rid of this crystal. You see, the Indian porters say it's bad magic. Like it goes or they go. So, Doctor, if you're away on a cheap day trip to Mars, perhaps you could look after it for me, Brigadier? Or if you're away in Geneva, how about it, Mike? Or my lovely Sergeant Benton? (Clegg has picked up the crystal.)
I must say I miss you all very much.
And the coffee's just about as filthy as UNIT tea, if that's possible. I must go now, or I'll miss the next cleft-stick to civilisation.
You're too late, Brigadier. He's dead.
No, I don't see how it could have done.
Wait a minute. Now there is a chance.
Well, Professor Clegg was attached to this IRIS machine when he died. Perhaps it recorded his thoughts.
Well, there's only one thing to do now.
I must look into the crystal myself.
I'll bear it in mind, Brigadier.
Hmm?
Well, I'm already responsible for the death of one man, Sergeant. Thanks just the same.
Absolutely beautiful.
Oh, the smell of that coffee. Thank you, Sergeant.
You know, I've always said that next to Mrs Samuel Pepys you make the finest cup of coffee in the world.
Spiders?
Oh, yes. You know, Brigadier, when I was a young man, there was an old hermit who lived half way up a mountain just behind our house. I spent some of the finest hours of my life with that old man.
And it was from him I first learnt how to look into my mind.
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Brigadier. When I looked into that crystal, all I could see was the face of my old teacher.
Of course I'm listening, Sarah. Go on. What happened next?
Hmm mmm.
Oh, that's fascinating.
The crystal lattice is equally balanced from right to left. It's remarkable.
Yes, of course I am. You went down into the cellar to see if Tommy was still there, right?
Probably analogous to the laser. Well, go on! I'm listening.
It's coherent thought.
A scientific pun. What did you say?
No, no, no, before that. What did you say before that? Did you say spider?
Now listen to me, Sarah. This is very important. Tell me the whole story right from the beginning.
So you see, it's after seeing these spiders that he died. So, there must be some connection.
Oh, I brought it back some time ago from a planet called Metebelis Three.
Oh, you wouldn't have done. It's also called the blue planet because the moonlight is blue, you see?
No, I went there deliberately to fetch it. It has strange properties, a Metebelis crystal. It can affect the mind.
No, just the opposite usually. It clears the mind and amplifies its power.
Oh, yes, of course, if the mind operating it was motivated by evil.
But there aren't any giant spiders on Metebelis Three. At least, there weren't any when I was there.
Wait a minute. There could be a time difference.
Or a later one.
No, just wait a minute. Give me a chance to work this thing out.
Well, they're just as real.
What happened, Sergeant? Somebody attack you?
No, no, Brigadier! You'll damage my car. (Benton starts up Bessie and drives her over to them.)
Well done, Sergeant. Take me to the airstrip. We'll spot him from the air.
Get after him, Lethbridge Stewart. I'll contact you by R/T.
Hello, Brigadier? Look, is this thing working? Can you hear me? Over.
Yes, he's getting away from you. Take the next right fork. Try and cut him off. Out.
He's turned off to the right, Brigadier. I say again. He's turned off to the right.
Look, he can't be far away, Brigadier. We must spread out and search.
Oh no, he hasn't.
Right, fasten your seatbelt.
Stand well back, Brigadier.
Yes, of course we're flying.
Now, keep your eyes peeled for the gyroplane.
Right, hang on!
Nothing. He can't last much longer. He must be almost out of fuel.
Right, here we go. Coming in to land.
Oh, about eighty miles, I should say.
No, no, of course not.
Look, Venerable, may we see this man Lupton now? I'm sorry to seem pushy but it is very important.
And it'll all be the same in a hundred years. Yes, where have I heard that before?
Yes, er, Venerable, could we see Mister Lupton now please?
I think he's trying to tell you something important, Mike.
Where is this cellar, Mike?
Get out of my way!
Sarah, get off that mandala!
Well, never mind. I doubt if he could have told us very much anyway. Well, there's only one thing for me to do, Mike. I've got to get after her, to Metebelis Three.
Yes, of course.
Well, the Tardis may be a little erratic, I'll admit. After all, she is getting on a bit. But Metebelis Three is the one planet I can be absolutely certain of reaching. You see, I wired the coordinates into the programmer.
Yes, well, I always leave the actual landing to the Tardis herself. She's no fool, you know.
Yes. Yes, I do, don't I? Bye, Mike.
Hello, Sarah Jane.
Don't do that.
The Queen? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Greetings, O most noble Queen. May I ask what you intend to do with this young lady?
Both Miss Smith and I come from Earth, your Majesty.
Now just a minute, your Majesty.
Sarah.
Sarah. Tardis. In the, in the Tardis there's a machine in that old, old leather satchel. It's the only thing that will save me.
Yes.
Sarah. Sarah Jane.
Give it to me.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Wakey, wakey! Rise and shine! Show a leg, the weather's fine.
Mmm, this is good. It's very good. What is it?
Mutton? You have sheep on Metebelis Three?
Thank you.
So your ancestors were colonists?
Over four hundred years ago? You know the story very well, don't you.
An oral tradition so detailed. It's fascinating.
Oh, Sarah'll be all right for the moment.
Because the spiders'll be watching her. They'll want to know how she got here and why.
Mmm. Yes, I think I can. But first of all I must know what we're up against. How did the spiders get here?
I see.
Hmm. Go out and get me some stones, will you?
Yes, pebbles. You know, about that big. Little pieces of rock. As many different kinds as you can.
Let's just saying I'm playing a hunch, hmm?
Why should the blue crystal be the only mineral on Metebelis Three with an unusual structure? Now I'm looking for a stone that will absorb the energy of the spider's attacks. Oh, I do beg your pardon. The eight legs' attacks.
Ah, more stones. Thank you.
Ah, that's more like it. Now we're really getting somewhere.
Follow me as soon as you can.
No, I've got something much better than that.
Oh, very well.
Arak. Tuar.
Oh, I wouldn't say that. He's a highly intelligent fellow. You can tell at a glance.
Ah, poor fellow. I hope they won't be too hard on him. He fell into bad company, you know. Oh well, I must be off.
Oh dear, this is getting monotonous.
Well, now I know what a fly feels like. What an absolutely fascinating experience.
Judging by the habits of our captor's Earth cousins, I would say we're probably in the larder.
I think they'll find I'm rather a tough old bird.
Yes. Yes, make a good item on the next agenda of the spider council meeting. Whether to stew a Time Lord or roast him in a slow oven.
Yes, something they can really get their teeth into, what?
They didn't arrive until much later. We're in the future remember, Sarah.
Now listen to me, both of you, listen. Arak is trying to get together some of the men from the other villages. They're going to try a rescue.
Ah, no. No, they know how to protect themselves now.
Well, you see, what
Where are you taking her?
Sarah, try and stall them as long as you can.
Look, much as I admire your stoic acceptance of the inevitable, I would appreciate it if you'd shut up for a moment. What I'm trying to do requires the utmost concentration.
Compress the muscles. It's a little, a little trick I learned from an old friend of mine.
Harry, er, what was his name? Er, Hopkins. No, no, that's not right. Er, Hetherington. No, that's not right either. It wasn't an English name. Er, Hackenschmidt. No, I know it began with an H.
Houdini. Yes, that was it. Harry Houdini.
Oh, don't worry, old chap. As soon as I've rescued Sarah, I'll find a knife and come back for you.
I heard the voice of my assistant?
But she called out to me for help.
Goes the weasel.
Who, who are you?
Why can't I see you?
But why do you want that particular crystal? It's no different from all the others.
No! No, never.
No. No! No, I will not!
No! No, I will not! No!
Sarah, so you're safe then.
Look, there's no time for foolish
Goes the weasel.
How did you manage that?
The key! I've lost the key!
Sarah.
Oh, they'll be out for quite a time. But as long as they're unconscious, they're quite safe.
Oh, they've been taken over.
Yes.
Where are you taking us?
Yes, yes, Sarah. All in good time.
(Tibetan.)
A little, sir, yes.
I apologised to the Rinpoche for not bringing him a cotton scarf.
Yes, well, I have a strange feeling that you already know most of it. You see, I found a crystal. A blue crystal.
Well, perhaps stole might be a better word. Forgive me. Have we met before?
Well it didn't occur to me that I had stolen it, at the time. You see
Yes, yes, Sarah. All in good time.
(Tibetan.)
A little, sir, yes.
I apologised to the Rinpoche for not bringing him a cotton scarf.
Yes, well, I have a strange feeling that you already know most of it. You see, I found a crystal. A blue crystal.
Well, perhaps stole might be a better word. Forgive me. Have we met before?
Well it didn't occur to me that I had stolen it, at the time. You see
So you see, the crystal was even more important than I thought. They want it very badly.
No, sir, never. Once they get a hold of that crystal, nothing can stop them taking over the Earth.
Or even the universe itself. I wish I knew where that crystal was at this moment.
Thank heavens it's safe.
Sarah, what's the matter with you?
Sarah, what's come over you? (Sarah zaps the Doctor with energy and he clutches his chest.)
Sarah, what has the Queen Spider done to you? What has she done?
Good grief.
Sarah, listen to me. Struggle against the spider, Sarah. Fight it!
Sarah, look at the crystal. Look at it! Look deep into its blue light.
Concentrate, Sarah! Concentrate!
What have you got to be sorry about? You did very well. You should be proud of yourself.
Do you mean me?
Oh no, Sarah, no. No, he's talking about my greed.
Yes, my greed for knowledge, for information. He's saying that all this is basically my fault. If I hadn't taken the crystal in the first place. I know who you are now.
It's been a long, long time.
Oh, yes. Yes, he was my teacher. My, my guru, if you like. In another time, another place.
No. Nor for me.
Yes, well, I had to get away. I hadn't your power.
Yes. Yes, when a Time Lord's body wears out, he regenerates, becomes new.
Me too, I'm afraid.
Shush.
No, I
Is there no other way?
Very well. Give me the crystal.
Take the crystal to the Great One.
Nevertheless, I have to go.
Arak. Tuar. Your attack was a success, then?
Look, I need your help. I want to go into the mountain, into the cave of crystal.
Well, nevertheless I have to go. Will you show me the way?
So, you lied. Your attack failed.
To return the crystal.
Yes. Yes, of course.
No. I shall return the crystal only to the Great One herself.
Is there any among you would dare take it from me?
Well if I had not, why should I have returned?
I've brought you the crystal. Now why don't you just take it and leave the humans in peace, both here and on Earth?
Well, why is it so important to you?
And then?
But you've built a positive feedback circuit. You're trying to increase your mental powers to infinity.
Now listen to me. Listen. I haven't got much time left. What you're trying to do is impossible. If you complete that circuit, the energy will build up and up until it cannot be contained. You will destroy yourself.
Stop. Stop! Don't you see what's happened to you?
Hello, Sarah. I got lost in the time vortex. The Tardis brought me home.
I had to face my fear, Sarah. I had to face my fear. That was more important than just going on living.
A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life there's

Up. Look up.
Up. Up. Look up.
Move your feet.
Oh, come on, Amy, think. The ship crashed with the power still on, yeah? So what else is still on?
The artificial gravity. One good jump, and up we fell. Shot out the grav globe to give us an updraft, and here we are.
They're feeding on the radiation from the wreckage, draining all the power from the ship, restoring themselves. Within an hour, they'll be an army.
They're taking out the lights. Look at them. Look at the Angels. Into the ship, now. Quickly, all of you.
It's just a corridor. The gravity orientates to the floor. Now, in here, all of you. Don't take your eyes off the Angels. Move, move, move.
They're here, now. In the dark, we're finished.
Run!
No, it's a time bomb. Well, it's a death trap and a time bomb. And now it's a dead end. Nobody panic. Oh, just me then. What's through here?
I've thought about that.
And we'll all plunge to our deaths. See? I've thought about it. The security protocols are still live. There's no way to override them. It's impossible.
Two minutes.
And don't look at their eyes. Anywhere else. Not the eyes. I've isolated the lighting grid. They can't drain the power now.
Yes. Good, good, good. Good in many ways. Good you like it so far.
Well, there's only one way to open this door. I guess I'll need to route all the power in this section through the door control.
Including the lights. All of them. I'll need to turn out the lights.
Fraction of a second. Maybe longer. Maybe quite a bit longer.
I'm guessing. We're being attacked by statues in a crashed ship. There isn't a manual for this.
No other way. Bishop.
Excuse me.
Bless you. Bishop.
Amy, when the lights go down, the wheel should release. Spin it clockwise four turns.
No, four. Four turns.
Ready!
Turn!
Fall back!
Yeah?
Ah, now you're getting it. You've bought us time though. That's good. I am good with time.
Five minutes, max.
Five.
Why'd you say nine?
Yeah, there is. Course there is. This is a galaxy class ship. Goes for years between planet falls. So, what do they need?
Well, it's a sealed unit, but they must have installed it somehow. This whole wall should slide up. There's clamps. Release the clamps.
And if we're lucky, an escape route.
Is there another exit? Scan the architecture, we don't have time to get lost in there.
Oh, more than trees. Way better than trees. You're going to love this. Treeborgs. Trees plus technology. Branches become cables become sensors on the hull. A forest sucking in starlight, breathing out air. It even rains. There's a whole mini-climate. This vault is an ecopod running right through the heart of the ship. A forest in a bottle on a space ship in a maze. Have I impressed you yet, Amy Pond?
Seven?
You said seven.
Oh, good. That's where we need to go.
Quick as you like.
Ah. There you are, Angel Bob. How's life? Sorry, bad subject.
Achieve? We're not achieving anything. We're just hanging. It's nice in here. Consoles, comfy chairs, a forest. How's things with you?
Well, we've got comfy chairs. Did I mention?
I made him say comfy chairs.
Okay, Bob, enough chat. Here's what I want to know. What have you done to Amy?
What's in her eye?
DOCTOR; You're counting down from ten. You have been for a couple of minutes.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Get a life, Bob. Oops, sorry again. There's power on this ship, but nowhere near that much.
Laughing?
No. Wait. There's something I've missed.
Yes. Two parts of space and time that should never have touched.
Yeah, fine.
Right with you.
Oh yes, you are. Bishop?
So, what are you? Oh, that's bad. Ah, that's extremely very not good.
Do not blink.
Argh!
Why am I not dead then?
Good, and not so good. Oh, this isn't even a little bit good. I mean, is that it? Is that the power that brought you here? That's pure Time Energy. You can't feed on that. That's now power, that's the fire at the end of the universe. I'll tell you something else.
Never let me talk!
Oh, yeah.
You don't. Bishop, the Angels are in the forest.
I found a crack in the wall and told them it was the end of the universe.
The end of the universe. Let's have a look, then.
Everything. You're dying.
Yes, you're right. If we lie to her, she'll get all better. Right. Amy, Amy, Amy. What's the matter with Amelia? Something's in her eye. What does that mean? Does it mean anything?
Busy.
Course you're scared. You're dying. Shut up.
What happened? She stared at the Angel. She looked into the eyes of an Angel for too long
Come on, come on, come on. Wakey, wakey. She watched an Angel climb out of the screen. She stared at the Angel and, and
A living mental image in a living human mind. But we stare at them to stop them getting closer. We don't even blink, and that is exactly what they want. Because as long as our eyes are open, they can climb inside. There's an Angel in her mind.
Please just shut up. I'm thinking. Now, counting. What's that about? Bob, why are they making her count?
Okay, but why? What for?
Inside your head, in the vision centres of your brain, there's an Angel. It's like there's a screen, a virtual screen inside your mind and the Angel is climbing out of it, and it's coming to shut you off.
If it was a real screen, what would we do? We'd pull the plug. We'd kill the power. But we can't just knock her out, the Angel would just take over.
We've got to shut down the vision centres of her brain. We've got to pull the plug. Starve the Angel.
How would you starve your lungs?
Amy, close your eyes.
Good, because that's not you, that's the Angel inside you. It's afraid. Do it. Close your eyes.
Amy, listen to me. If you open your eyes now for more than a second, you will die. The Angel is still inside you. We haven't stopped it, we've just sort of paused it. You've used up your countdown. You cannot open your eyes.
We're too exposed everywhere. And Amy can't move. And anyway, that's not the plan.
I don't know yet. I haven't finished talking. Right! Father, you and your Clerics, you're going to stay here, look after Amy. If anything happens to her, I'll hold every single one of you personally responsible, twice. River, you and me, we're going to find the Primary Flight Deck which is
A quarter of a mile straight ahead, and from there we're going to stabilise the wreckage, stop the Angels, and cure Amy.
I'll do a thing.
I don't know. It's a thing in progress. Respect the thing. Moving out!
I don't need you.
What? You two engaged or something?
You'll be safer here. We can't protect you on the move. I'll be back for you soon as I can, I promise.
I always come back. Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not let that girl open her eyes. And keep watching the forest. Stop those Angels advancing. Amy, later. River, going to need your computer!
Amy, you need to start trusting me. It's never been more important.
If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trust me.
I don't know yet, but I'm working it out. Now, listen. Remember what I told you when you were seven?
No. No, that's not the point. You have to remember.
Er, readings from a crack in the wall.
Don't know, but here's what I think. One day there's going to be a very big bang. So big every moment in history, past and future, will crack.
How can you be engaged, in a manner of speaking?
You were in Stormcage?
The date. The date of the explosion, where the crack begins.
Amy's time.
What? What did you say? Time's running out, is that what you said?
I know what you meant. Hush. But what if it could?
Time. What if time could run out?
Cracks. Cracks in time. Time running out. No, couldn't be. Couldn't be. But how is a duck pond a duck pond if there aren't any ducks? And she didn't recognise the Daleks. Okay, time can shift. Time can change. Time can be rewritten. Ah. Oh!
Time can be unwritten.
It's been happening all around me and I haven't even noticed.
The CyberKing. A giant Cyberman walks over all of Victorian London and no one remembers.
Never mind the Angels. There's worse here than Angels.
Let him go.
I can't stop looking at it, it'll kill you.
Can't you wriggle out?
You're dead if I leave you.
I'm not going.
Trust who?
Then tell me.
Just tell me why she was in Stormcage?
Who?
Who did she kill?
You'll die.
I wish I'd known you better.
Ready?
Octavian's dead. So is that teleport. You're wasting your time. I'm going to need your communicator.
Amy? Amy? Is that you?
Where are you? Are the Clerics with you?
No, they wouldn't.
Time running out. Amy, I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I should never have left you there.
You come to us. The Primary Flight Deck, the other end of the forest.
Turn on the spot.
Just do it. Turn on the spot.
When the communicator sounds like my screwdriver, that means you're facing the right way. Follow the sound. You have to start moving now. There's Time Energy
Spilling out of that crack, and you have to stay ahead of it.
I'm sorry, I really am, but the Angels can only kill you.
Just keep moving!
If the Time Energy catches up with you, you'll never have been born. It will erase every moment
Of your existence. You will never have lived at all.
Now, keep your eyes shut and keep moving.
What else have you got! River! Tell me!
The Angels running from the fire. They came here to feed on the Time Energy, now it's going to feed on them. Amy, listen to me.
I'm sending a bit of software to your communicator. It's a proximity detector. it'll beep if there's something in your way. You just manoeuvre till the beeping stops.
Because, Amy, this is important.
The forest is full of Angels.
You're going to have to walk like you can see.
Look, just keep moving.
Er, keep eating.
Feed it.
A big, complicated space time event should shut it up for a while.
Like me, for instance!
It's a warning. There are Angels round you now.
Amy, listen to me. This is going to be hard but I know
You can do it. The Angels are scared
And running, and right now they're not that interested in you. They'll assume you can see them and their instincts will kick in. All you've got to do is walk like you can see.
Just don't open your eyes. Walk like you can see. You're not moving. You have to do this. Now. You have to do this!
River Song, I could bloody kiss you.
The Angels are draining the last of the ship's power, which means the shield's going to release.
Angel Bob, I presume.
Yeah, and look at you all, running away. What can I do for you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Could do, could do that. But why?
Well, there is that.
Oh, be serious. Compared to me, these Angels are more complicated than you, and it would take every one of them to amount to me, so get a grip.
No, seriously, get a grip.
No, I mean it. River, Amy, get a grip.
Thing is, Bob, the Angels are draining all the power from this ship. Every last bit of it. And you know what? I think they've forgotten where they're standing. I think they've forgotten the gravity of the situation. Or to put it another way, Angels.
Night, night.
Me too.
Neither did you. I kept saying. The Angels all fell into the Time Field. The Angel in your memory never existed. It can't harm you now.
You're a time traveller now. Amy. It changes the way you see the universe, forever. Good, isn't it?
Yeah, for now. But the explosion that caused it is still happening. Somewhere out there, somewhere in time.
What now?
Octavian said you killed a man.
A good man.
Who?
The Pandorica. Ha! That's a fairy tale.
I look forward to it.
Can I trust you. River Song?
Time can be rewritten.
Okay.
Well.
Blimey.
We've been gone five minutes.
Why did you leave it here?
Yeah.
Who's the lucky fellow?
Ah, the good looking one. Or the other one?
Well, he was good too.
Why would you need comforting?
Well, yes, natural. I think sometimes. Well, lots of times.
Yeah. No.
Oh right, yeah. No, still not getting it.
No! You're getting married in the morning!
Amy, listen to me. I am nine hundred and seven years old. Do you understand what that means?
Yeah. No, no, no. I'm nine hundred and seven, and look at me. I don't get older, I just change. You get older, I don't, and this can't ever work.
But you're human. You're Amy. You're getting married in the morning. In the morning.
It's you. It's all about you. Everything. It's about you.
Amy Pond. Mad, impossible, Amy Pond. I don't know why, I have no idea, but quite possibly the single most important thing in the history of the universe is that I get you sorted out right now.
Come on.
Amy's time.

It works, K9. It works. Listen, I've got a little surprise for you.
You and I are going away on holiday.
A nice, long holiday.
Would you like that, K9?
Shush. Halergan Three's lovely, K9. You'll really like it. Beaches, palm trees, sunshine all day. Hot and
Yes?
Look, listen, I, I, I don't wish to appear rude, but who are you?
Well, only a guardian could
Oh, I see. Well, in that case, sir.
Just as you say.
That's very flattering, sir.
Well, I've heard a few stories. Old legends, myths, that sort of thing.
Sorry, sir.
Well hidden then, I hope, sir.
Stop everything?
Ah.
Eternal chaos?
Look, I'm sure there must be plenty of other Time Lords who'd be delighted to
Yes, I was afraid you'd say something like that. Ah! You want me to volunteer, isn't that it?
And if I don't?
Nothing? You mean nothing will happen to me?
Ah. What do they look like, these segments? How will I know them?
Yes, I thought they might be.
Then how will I recognise them?
Thank you.
An assistant? Please, sir, on an assignment like this, I'd much rather work alone. In my experience, assistants mean trouble. I have to protect them and show them and teach them and couldn't I just, couldn't I just manage with K9?
He is a very sensitive machine! Sorry, sir.
Very well, sir. If you insist.
Yes?
How am I to prevent that?
Beware the Black Guardian.
I'm so sorry, K9. The holiday's off.
(sotto) That's the new assistant.
I'm so sorry about that. Is there anything we can do?
What's this?
Ah.
Yes, I suppose it must be for someone as young and inexperienced as you are.
I suppose you think we should be impressed by that, too?
That information is confidential! That President. I should have thrown him to the Sontarans when I had the chance.
I know how it works.
A hole. What's a hole doing in my Tardis?
You? You put a hole in my T? Never mind, old girl. Never mind. I'll soon have it fixed.
Oh, that's clever. That's very clever. Ah! Four one eight zero.
No, there's no need.
I know. Cyrrhenis Minima.
Just a matter of experience, you see.
What else does it do?
Ah ha. Well, that could be very useful.
Well. I'd like you to stay out of my way as much as possible and try and keep out of trouble. I don't suppose you can make tea?
No, no, I don't suppose you can. They don't teach you anything useful at the Academy, do they. Gadgets and gimmickry. Never touch, never trust gimmicky gadgets.
Ah ah.
Look. The coordinates have changed. They're different already.
I'm not sulking.
I'm not old. What?
Seven hundred and fifty six. That's not old, that's just mature.
Well, I ought to know my own age.
Now, listen. It's no good, this isn't going to work.
Indeed.
What's that supposed to mean?
Is that the sort of rubbish they're pouring into your head at the Academy?
I'll show you whether I'm suffering from a massive compensation syndrome. And you're not going back to Gallifrey, not for a long time yet, I regret to say. Read out those coordinates again.
Same as before. Distance?
One hundred and sixteen parsecs. Must be the planet of Ribos. If it changes again while we're in the vortex, we could lose it. On the other hand
I'll make the decisions here!
We'll take a chance.
Ha ha! Fresh!
If you can't stand the cold, stay out of the freezer. Which way?
Well, you've got the core.
Good. Now, pay attention. I'm not anticipating any trouble, but it's as well to be prepared for these things. Ground rules. Rule one, do exactly as I say. Rule two, stick close to me, and Rule three, let me do all the talking. Is that perfectly clear?
Good. One more thing. Your name.
It's too long. By the time I've called look out, what's your name?
By the time I've called that out, you could be dead. I'll call you Romana.
It's either Romana or Fred.
Good. Come on, Romana. Here, try that for size.
The secret of survival is always to expect the unexpected.
Oh! Ow!
Yes I wondered if you'd notice that. That's good. That's very good, very good.
Extraordinary.
Well, you heard.
But he said it in a Somerset accent. Somerset's one of the Earth counties.
Maybe he's a cricket scout. Yes, they could do with a good leg spinner.
What? Oh nothing, nothing. Remember Rule one. Come on.
Did they teach you anything about locks at the Academy?
Sonic screwdriver. You'll like this. Keep an eye on the sentry.
Sleeping on duty's a serious offence. If anyone comes, you can wake him up.
It was nothing.
Ceremonial regalia, sacred relics.
DOCTOR Mmm.
Never mind that. Let's just find the segment. It'll be daylight soon.
Good. Let's locate it, convert it, and get out of here before the locals wake up.
Because they're multilevered interlocks.
Get on with it? Get
One more lock to go.
Romana?
Quickly!
A Shrivenzale.
Millions. Millions! You shouldn't have volunteered if you're scared of a little thing like that.
Let's hide. Hide. The locks.
Oh, yes, we can explain. Sorry old thing, we're just helping ourselves to your Crown Jewels! They'd have our hands off before you could say Rassilon's Rod.
Of course, they might not chop our hands off. They might just feed us to the Shrivenzale.
Suppose he's after the same thing as we are?
Don't jump to conclusions about anyone or anything. It could lead you astray.
Good. And don't be sarcastic, either. That can also get you into trouble.
If he's after the same thing as we are, maybe he's got a plan to get it out of the room.
Mmm.
On the other hand, he could just be an agent of the Black Guardian.
Nothing, nothing, nothing. You're not supposed to know about that.
About nothing! All you need to know is that there might be some competition in our search.
Really? You're in wonderful condition.
On the other hand, he might be just an innocent crook. It's fascinating, isn't it? Don't you think?
Oh, I don't know. My friend and I couldn't help overhearing. That's my friend, Romana, and I thought it had the ring of truth. Do you think it had the ring of truth?
No, we come from the north.
Incredible.
That is. That's the biggest lump of jethrik I've ever set eyes on.
I wonder if old Taffy knows the real value of it. Scringe stone found in a dead man's pocket? A lost mine? A phony map. Are people still falling for that old guff? I mean, are they?
No.
Romana, you can't be a successful crook with a dishonest face, can you.
You've got all the facts, study them.
Nonsense. Good mental exercise. An Academy graduate doesn't need things explaining, surely?
Hmm? What?
Splendid. Let's go.
Here, the other way in. Look, marks of a grappling iron.
Yes. Garron and old honest face must have planted the jethrik in the cabinet last night.
Because they're trying to sell the map of a nonexistent mine, that's why.
I agree. I wouldn't dream of interfering.
They drugged it, otherwise, you and I wouldn't have been here now, eh? What do we do next? No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you. They've got to come back for the jethrik and the gold, all right? Now, when they do come back
Right!
Stay here and watch them.
I'm going to try and get down there before them.
What? What?
I couldn't sleep either.
What? No, please. Please, don't blow that. You'll wake everybody up.
Oh, permission. Permission? I've got permission. Do you want to see my permission?
Tricks? Oh, dear chap. My dear.
Look.
Your eyes are closing. Sit down. Closing. That's right. Shush.
Almost everything.
Don't move, we've got you covered.
Stand up. Stand up!
That's very wise of you.
Well, I've just got a few loose ends to tie up.
No, no, hold it, hold it, hold it. This must be a case of mistaken identity.
Yes, get up you cringing cur.
Don't hit the cringing cur.
What?
It's for measuring time on nineteen different planets.
It can also be used for modifying dithyrambic oscillations, cleaning your shoes, sharpening pencils. It can even peel your apples.
Oh, I don't know. Once I've explained this little mistake, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends. (to Romana) Sit down. I get on, I get on terribly well with the aristocracy.
We're not a dirty gang, are we?
What, with a open, honest face?
Yes. I nearly bumped into him in the Reliquary. He's very light on his feet, isn't he?
Then there's not much point in telling him, is there?
Is that supposed to comforting?
Then wasn't it a little foolhardy trying to sell him a non-existent mine?
Yes, mine. That's your game, isn't it? Mines! GARRON: If mine's mines, what's yours?
Oh, never mind about that. Let's get out of here.
I'm going to whistle up some help. Cover your ears.
When did you leave Earth, Garron?
Really? What happened?
No!
The Opera House?
But of course.
No.
I'm not surprised.
Please don't panic, Romana. Come and sit down. Come on, come and sit down. Listen, when you've faced death as often as I have, this is much more fun. Go on, Garron. Tell us about the jethrik.
Tell her, Garron.
No, she doesn't, do you?
Where did you get your piece?
You stole it.
Fraud's another one. Tell me, Garron, how many jethrik mines have you sold since then?
No?
Tell me something, Garron. Why do you think the Graff was interested in buying this planet even before you conned him into believing there was a jethrik mine here?
I'm asking you, Garron.
And now he's got nowhere to go, is that it?
What? A new world?
Shush!
I don't like the sound of that. A lot of people are going to die if we don't get out of here.
Yes.
Must be nearly dawn now.
Yes, terrified.
No, they made too good a job of that.
Give me what's left of your own two-way.
Put your finger there, Romana.
Of course, I can't promise you that this will work.
Right, so keep your fingers crossed. Not you, Romana.
That should catch his attention. You use it, Garron. He knows your voice.
Just a moment, K9.
Never mind about that, Garron. Get on with it.
Come on, quickly, let's get out of here.
Which way's the Concourse?
Come on. K9, don't stop at all the corners. Come on.
The Concourse that way guarded.
Because it's not there.
The crown has nothing to do with it. Look at the tracer.
Yes, it's pointing toward Unstoffe and his piece of jethrik.
Yes. I thought you'd have realised that, a bright girl like you.
How many times do you think that crown has seen the light of day?
I'd say twice a century.
Listen, now listen. We took two bearings on the segment in the Tardis, remember?
Now, obviously, the segment moved a considerable distance between the readings, so
Exactly. Garron and Unstoffe planted it there.
Simple, isn't it?
Well?
Good. Unstoffe got the message.
This little gadget points us toward the jethrik, and it's pointing that way.
Exactly. Come on, follow me.
Careful, careful. These steps are treacherous.
Garron.
Your friend's got a good nose for a hiding place.
Shush!
Which way?
What?
No.
If you call that being nearly killed, you haven't lived yet. Just stay with me, and you'll get a lot nearer.
In fact, you're a lot nearer right now.
No. No bickering.
Who's carrying a valuable piece of jethrik.
Quite right, quite right.
You go that way, I'll go this way.
That way.
Well, someone's got to keep an eye on Vynda-K. Well, don't just lie there, do something.
Move.
Now.
Now!
DOCTOR; K9.
No, don't explain, don't explain. Look after those two. Off you go.
No, sir.
Three, two, one.
Four o'clock and all's well. Goodbye, Garron!
Yes?
What don't you understand, Garron? Go on, ask me something. What is it don't you understand? Who came first, the chicken or the egg? Go on, ask me something. Ask me something.
Garron, I would've thought you'd have known that. Sleight of hands. GARRON: Oh.
I was trained by Maskelyne.
I do dislike faint praise. It was astoundingly clever, wasn't it Garron?
Yes.
Yes?
All right.
Thank you very much. Goodbye, Garron.
What's your name?
Goodbye, Unstoffe.
Would you like to do it? Here.
All right. No, you do it. Go on, you do it. I'll just stand here and watch.
The first segment. Simple, wasn't it. Only five more to go.

It's fine. Everything's fine. Nothing's wrong, all fine. Excuse me. What day is it?
Saturday. Good. Good, I like Saturdays.
Yeah.
Exactly. If she can cross from her parallel world to your parallel world, than that means the walls of the universe are breaking down, which puts everything in danger. Everything. But how?
Yeah.
Don't know. It came from outside.
We haven't moved. We're fixed. It can't have. No. The Tardis is still in the same place, but the Earth has gone. The entire planet. It's gone.
I don't know, Donna. I just don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know.
There's no readings. Nothing. Not a trace. Not even a whisper. Oh, that is fearsome technology.
We've got to get help.
Donna, I'm taking you to the Shadow Proclamation. Hold tight.
Posh name for police. Outer space police. Here we go.
No bo ho sho ko ro to so. Bokodozogobofopojo.
Moho.
Yeah. More to the point, I've got a missing planet.
How many?. Which ones? Show me.
Callufrax Minorr. Jahoo. Shallacatop. Woman Wept. Clom. Clom's gone? Who'd want Clom?
That's it! Donna, brilliant. Planets are being taken out of time as well as space. Let's put this into 3-D.
Now, if we add Pyrovillia and Adipose Three. Something missing. Where else, where else, where else? Where else lost, lost, lost, lost. Oh! The Lost Moon of Poosh.
Nothing. The planets rearranged themselves into the optimum pattern. Oh, look at that. Twenty seven planets in perfect balance. Come on, that is gorgeous.
All those worlds fit together like pieces of an engine. It's like a powerhouse. What for?
Someone tried to move the Earth once before. Long time ago. Can't be.
Donna, come on, think. Earth. There must've been some sort of warning. Was anything happening back in your day, like electrical storms, freak weather, patterns in the sky?
Oh, okay, never mind.
The bees disappearing. The bees disappearing. The bees disappearing!
Or, they were going back home.
Planet Melissa Majoria.
Don't be so daft. Not all of them. But if the migrant bees felt something coming, some sort of danger, and escaped? Tandocca.
Tandocca Scale is the series of wavelengths used as a carrier signals by migrant bees. Infinitely small. No wonder we didn't see it. It's like looking for a speck of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look, there it is. The Tandocca trail. The transmat that moved the planets was using the same wavelength, we can follow the path.
I am.
We're a bit late. The signal's scattered, but it's a start.
I've got a blip. It's just a blip, But it's definitely a blip.
Oh, really? What for?
Right. Yes. Course I will. I'll just go and get you the key.
It's stopped.
The Medusa Cascade. I came here when I was just a kid, ninety years old. It was the centre of a rift in time and space.
Nowhere. The Tandocca Trail stops dead. End of the line.
Phone!
Martha, is that you?. It's a signal.
Oh, just watch me.
Got it. Locking on.
We're travelling through time. One second in the future. The phone call's pulling us through.
Three, two, one.
The entire Medusa Cascade has been put a second out of sync with the rest of the universe. Perfect hiding place. Tiny little pocket of time. But we found them. Ooo, ooo, ooo, what's that? Hold on, hold on. Some sort of Subwave Network.
Sarah Jane. Who's that boy? That must be Torchwood. Oh, they're brilliant.
Look at you all, you clever people.
Captain Jack. Don't. Just don't.
Everyone except Rose.
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no. There's another signal coming through. There's someone else out there. Hello? Can you hear me? Rose?
But you were destroyed. In the very first year of the Time War, at the Gates of Elysium.
I saw your command ship fly into the jaws of the Nightmare Child.
I tried to save you.
But that's impossible. The entire War is timelocked.
And you made a new race of Daleks.
After all this time, everything we saw, everything we lost, I have only one thing to say to you. Bye!
Sarah Jane said they were taking the people. What for? Think, Donna. When you met Rose in that parallel world, what did she say?
Anything else?
Rose.
Long time no see.
It's starting.
I'm sorry, it's too late. I'm regenerating.

What? I can't hear you for the siren.
All right, there's no need to shout. Hold this.
Now watch.
Is it nice in South Croydon?
Well, maybe the season hasn't started yet.
Do you have a season in South Croydon?
We're in a quarry.
Well, how do I know? I don't know all the quarries that
Maybe he knows.
Maybe he knows South Croydon. Does he look as if he comes from South
What?
My friend's under that.
Steady, steady.
She's here. Now, gently, gently.
She's still breathing.
I said, she's still breathing.
Never mind about that. Get her off to the hospital, and quick. Come on.
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
Ow!
Oh no, no.
I'm well aware of that.
Yes. Tell me, how's Miss Smith? Sarah Jane Smith. We came in together.
Paralysis?
Well, sort of, yes.
A place called Gallifrey.
Probably. Look, could I see Miss Smith, please?
Anti-tetanus?
Yes, you're right. Solid as a rock.
Did you see it?
Hmm. Where is the path lab?
Will you let me know when she comes round, please?
What do you think of these plate, Doctor?
Yes, it's beautiful.
Does that crystalline lattice remind you of anything?
It's silicon based.
So how many living forms do you know with a silicon based molecular infrastructure?
Have we got access to an electron microscope, Doctor?
I don't know yet, but it's no hoax, Doctor Carter.
I said we were investigating certain extraterrestrial possibilities.
Such as viral infection on this planet.
Yes. I admit it's a fairly remote possibility. Viruses can survive, though not for a hundred and fifty million years as far as we know. Now this thing was found embedded in a stratum of blackstone dolomite.
Jurassic limestone.
Yes.
That's true. Would you prepare me another slide, please?
I think the answer might lie in the quarry.
Did you find anything else in the rubble?
Any plastic?
Yes, plastic.
No. Spaceships can be made of plastic, ceramic, metal.
Yes. Lifeforms don't all exist at the same time, you know.
Unless, of course, it just came fluttering down by itself. But why? And from where?
Yes. And where was it going?
Carter, you haven't seen Miss Smith, have you?
Good. Where?
Eh? What do you mean?
What? You mean she hit you?
Yes, of course.
What?
No, no, negative evidence. No fragments, which means whatever it was didn't crash. But we can see from the fracture lines on this sample there was an explosion.
Yes, and probably millions of miles away. Intriguing, isn't it?
Perhaps it wanted Miss Smith.
Well, she's the only human being to have had any contact with it for any length of time. Probably the only living organism to have had any contact with it since the event.
Inert, yes, dead, maybe not.
What is it?
Eh?
You mean it didn't look like that before?
You know what I think?
I think your sample's been quietly absorbing radiation from the machine.
Yes. Regenerating itself. Let's hope it hasn't absorbed enough to be dangerous. Put it somewhere safe, Carter, away from any further radiation.
Carter!
Where's the nearest nuclear reactor?
No, no, this way in.
But we weren't, were we. Come on, let's find the control centre.
Are you the top man here?
Oh, no, I wouldn't say that. She's certainly not
Oh, not necessarily.
Do you mind if I talk to her for a moment?
Can you punch up the plan for this building on this machine?
Ah.
Oh, at least, at least.
Her name's Smith. Miss Smith.
Could I
Could I speak to her?
Could I speak to her for a moment?
Sarah, listen to me. Can you hear me, Sarah?
Sarah, can you hear me?
Sarah, listen to me.
Shush, shush, shush.
Who is Eldrad, Sarah?
Shush.
Sarah, who is Eldrad? What does he want?
Sarah, what does he want?
Sarah. Keep her talking. I'm going in there.
Look, the plans to your cooling duct.
Not if I'm quick.
No, there's no need. You'd roast.
What?
Eldrad must live. Eldrad must live. Eldrad must live.
So sorry, Sarah.
Professor Watson, can you hear me?
Professor Watson, can you hear me?
Yes.
Is everything under control?
I hope so. We're in Decontamination now.
Good.
Shush. You're all right, Sarah, you're all right. Shush, shush, shush.
Well, of sorts, yes.
Sarah
What's the last thing you remember?
Come on, what's the last thing you remember?
Do you remember me digging you out and taking you to the hospital? The fossil?
Do you remember Doctor Carter?
Carter.
Just a minute, Professor, she doesn't remember a thing about
It's much more complicated than it seems.
I know, I know.
Shush. I don't think we can blame her for it.
I'll come to that in a minute. Just look at these readings. Stay there. Lie down, Sarah.
No trace of radioactivity whatsoever.
I know, enough to kill a school of whales, but there she is, unscathed.
Yes.
You won't believe me, I warn you.
Doctor Carter's dead, unfortunately.
Yes, he tried to kill me. He tried to push me over. Look, I'll start at the beginning.
We found a hand in the quarry. Or rather, she found a hand in the quarry.
That Eldrad must live.
Yes, you said Eldrad, Eldrad must live.
Yes, it seems to absorb radiation the same way as we do oxygen.
Living? It's not only living, it's regenerating.
Yes.
Exactly. Then we can study it, see what makes it tick.
Shall I go with him?
I don't think radiation's the danger.
Yes, there's no radiation. It absorbs it to rebuild tissue, see? The finger's already been replaced.
What happened to the ring you used on Carter and the guards, Sarah?
It must still be there. Driscoll? Driscoll?
There should have been a small crystal ring, about so big, in the reactor room.
Oh.
Would you mind? She must have dropped it when I dragged her out.
Sarah.
Sit down.
Now listen. I want you to concentrate.
Now, Sarah. Eldrad. Tell me about Eldrad.
But why, Sarah? Come on, why? Tell me why.
Who are we, Sarah?
Who saw the light? Did Carter see the light?
Tell me more, Sarah.
Tell me more.
Sarah. There's no need to obey the will of Eldrad. Put him out of your mind. You're free of him.
Yes.
Come on.
What?
What do you mean, no joy?
It must have been up there and he must have found it.
Because if affects the will of people who've been in contact with it. Remember Carter? He tried to kill me.
We're going to have to shift it. It'll be gaining strength.
I hope you're right.
Tell him I'm on my way.
Driscoll.
Driscoll! Driscoll! Driscoll!
Hello, Professor Watson?
Shush, listen, listen, listen. Driscoll's got the hand. I'm going down after him. Get out every available man you've got. And send someone down here. There's a guard unconscious.
Driscoll, stop!
Yes, I'm fine.
He's going to the core, where else.
It doesn't make any difference. That hand could set off a chain reaction.
You two get back to the control room. I'm going on inside.
Quick, get down!
No.
Yes.
Nothing happened. A sort of un-explosion has taken place.
Yes.
Oh no, come on in, Watson. Come on in. There's no radiation at all. Look.
Look.
He's in the core.
It did, but fortunately it was absorbed.
Oh, it could, it could, and it did.
Yes. Fission took place but instead of the explosion going outwards, it went inwards.
Driscoll's in the core, probably vapourised. You see, it's feeding on radiation and it's now in control of the core's potential itself.
Very much so, and regenerating.
To live, to grow. You see, instead of energy being created from matter, matter is being created from energy. Eldrad is rebuilding himself, and the probability is he'll strike again.
Who knows? Might as well put these back.
No, but I like to be tidy.
Somehow I can't see throwing missiles against that working.
No, no, no, wait a minute, Sarah. Maybe we should try and communicate with Eldrad.
Take it out?
Yes, I'm sure they are.
Yes, but what do we know about it?
It's intelligent.
An alien lifeforce, shipwrecked on a strange planet. Crystalline, regenerates through irradiation. It's probably afraid.
Fascinating.
This is intensely interesting, don't you? Come on, let's get out of here.
Any second now.
Yes.
They've been neutralised in some way.
Professor Watson, any being that can live, let alone thrive, inside a nuclear pile, is hardly likely to be deterred by a few primitive missiles.
On your standards, perhaps. I think we should try much older weapons.
Speech. Diplomacy?
Conversation? Come on, driver, let's go.
Right, you stay here. I'll go on. Shouldn't take long, one way or the other.
Not you. You stay with Professor Watson.
You did.
That's true.
Yes, but
I worry about you.
We'll both be careful.
Hello. You must be Eldrad. I was only going to say, how do you do.
No. Tell me, how did you prevent the missiles from exploding?
I thought so. Didn't I say I thought that was it? I thought
Well, I'm here to help them. I'm called the Doctor and this is Sarah Jane Smith. Say hello to the lady.
Eldrad
Can I ask you the same question?
You've got it wrong, Eldrad. We're the ones who saved you.
Oh, because they're stubborn and violent and sometimes they try to destroy things they don't understand.
You wouldn't be the first one to make that mistake. Others have tried.
Excuse me, I don't want to pry, but could you tell us how you got here?
What? After all this time?
Well, you've been on Earth a hundred and fifty million years, and you've lain dormant all that time.
You didn't need to do that. I would have told you.
Shush.
Only when such aggression is deemed to threaten the indigenous population. I think that's how it goes.
That would contravene the First Law of Time, a distortion of history. I can't do that.
I'm not refusing, Eldrad. I'll take you back, but it must be in the present time.
I don't think there's anyone else here.
Do you accept our conditions, Eldrad?
Good. Well, follow me.
No, Eldrad, leave him!
Eldrad! Eldrad, I swear to you, if you don't release him, I'll never return you to Kastria.
Listen. You owe your regeneration to this man. Remember that.
I'm not leaving here until I know he's all right.
Are you all right?
Very well.
Come on, let's go.
Come in, Eldrad. Welcome to the Tardis. Well, what do you think?
Well, thank you. I'm glad you like it.
They're in here.
Your weapon's won't work in here. We're in a state of temporal grace. We're multi-dimensional.
Well, in a sense, you see, we don't exist while we're in here. So you can't hurt us, and we can't hurt you.
No.
Well, in a sense I think you could say I'm helping Earth, Sarah. After all, I can't allow Eldrad to go on smashing nuclear power stations. Who knows how big she might become or what damage she might do. Anyway, I want to see Kastria.
Well, travel broadens the mind.
What does that mean?
Yes. I wonder, would you just give me a hand with the coordinates? I'm a bit vague on the exact whereabouts of Kastria.
Oh, just punch up seven four three eight oh oh O W eight I one two one two seven two seven two nine double one E eight E X four one one one three zero nine eleven five, and then see what happens.
No, I don't think so, no. Could I just check your coordinates.
Oh no, no, no. I just want to make sure we get there.
Eldrad, you'll achieve nothing on Kastria unless you overcome this paranoid obsession with treachery. You must cooperate.
Oh, don't be so abject. All we want is your cooperation. If you've missed those coordinates, symbolic resonance will occur in the trackoid time crystal, and if that happens, there'll be no chance of us landing anywhere, ever, ever, ever.
We've landed.
You may have left it a bit late, Eldrad. That hurricane's been blowing for a hundred and fifty million years.
Near enough Earth normal.
A bit high.
Damn it, the aliens have left this planet as good as dead.
But nothing functions. There's no power. I can't see how we can reach these survivors even if they do exist.
Inexhaustible energy.
Eldrad, what was in this tube?
Is there an antidote?
But there must be something?
Level three oh six.
Worked it out from the indicator. It's all based on roots of three.
Which way, Eldrad?
Come on.
Sarah!
Come on, Sarah. Stop making a fuss, Sarah. You're from South Croydon.
You're a carbon-based lifeform. The gas is only effective against silicon structures.
Come on.
Yes, I know. It's that way.
I have a superb sense of direction.
I said, I have a superb sense of direction.
You fit for another stint?
I'm not sure.
Perhaps the aliens wiped them out.
Could be millions of years.
Are you all right?
We have.
Well, if you're made of stone, you crumble to sand. We're walking on them.
It can't be far now.
It's your imagination. Nothing's been disturbed down here for thousands of years.
Oh, it was long ago. Come on.
What is it now?
Presumably the aliens Eldrad told us about. The people who invaded the planet.
Yes, yes, and they're very rare. And it's something of a coincidence that there are two of them in the same galaxy.
It's an abyss.
Come on.
Is there any other way, Eldrad?
It's only got to last until we get across.
You've got no faith, have you. Come on, Eldrad.
It's perfectly all right as long as you don't look down.
You coming?
I never met a door that couldn't be opened somehow.
No!
Get back.
Now stand back.
Get back. Get back!
You all right?
I understand it now. The crystal in the ring carries Eldrad's genetic code. A master print that enables her to reconstitute herself from any suitable radioactive material.
The question is, can I make this regenerator work?
I can't go any faster. I'm guessing as it is. We'll just have to use maximum irradiation and hope.
Yes, Sarah. We've been used. They were determined to get Eldrad one way or another.
We leave.
Eldrad?
How do we know you're Eldrad?
Ah. And so you modelled yourself on the first primitive you came in contact. He modelled himself on you.
Sarah thought you'd been obliterated.
What about your enemies?
Who is Rokon?
You destroyed the barriers?
So all that business of alien invaders was a lie?
Why should Rokon want to destroy you in the first place?
Ah. But you do.
Come on.
A recording from the past. The King obviously knew there was a chance that Eldrad would return.
Yes.
Where are your subjects, Majesty?
Shush.
Well, Rokon seems to have solved the problem for us. A drastic solution.
Oh, no. That's not in the contract. A one-way ticket only. My obligation to you is over. You're in your own world now.
No, I don't think so.
Oh well, since you've put it so nicely.
Here. Catch.
Come on, Sarah.
Down there. Get down there.
Hold this.
When I say pull, you pull.
Pull!
Well, the gravity of the law finally caught up with him.
Yes.
My magician's stick.
Come on.
No, we're well out of that. Goodbye, Kastria.
Oh, I doubt it. Very difficult to kill.
Whoa, easy, old girl, easy. These temperatures must have affected the thermo-couplings.
Oh, rubbish. I've been to much colder places.
Where's that astro-rectifier? What did you say?
Oh, good, good.
Multi-quantiscope.
Mergin nut.
No, no, forget the mergin nut. I'll have the ganymede driver.
Thank you.
Zeus plug.
Forget the zeus plug. I'll have the sonic screwdriver.
What was that you? I don't know why she goes on like this. There's really nothing the matter at all.
The call. The call from Gallifrey. Gallifrey. After all this time, Gallifrey. I can't take Sarah to Gallifrey. Must get her back home. Must reset the coordinates. South Croydon.
You're a good girl, Sarah.
What? How did you know?
I've had the call from Gallifrey.
So I can't take you with me. You've got to go.
Not this time. I don't know what's going to happen.
No. I've received the call, and as a Time Lord I must obey.
Yes.
We've landed, Sarah.
We've landed.
South Croydon. Hillview Road, to be exact.
Thanks.
Oh, Sarah. Don't you forget me.
Yes. Till we meet again, Sarah.

Oh dear.
Well, I don't think we're quite where I expected. Never mind. This looks very interesting.
Yes. I've never seen a computer quite like this before, Jamie.
Yes, but what does it control?
Jamie, stop worrying. There's obviously nobody here.
Well, this machine is programmed to operate by itself.
Well, I'm not sure Zoe, but I think we're on an unmanned spacecraft in a fixed orbit. We're too far away from anywhere to be a weather satellite. Let's see what clues we can find through here, shall we?
What? (A floor panel lifts and Sorba starts shooting as the Doctor, Zoe and Jamie run out of the room.)
There's only one thing we can do.
Run!
That should hold them for a little while.
I don't know, but we're certainly not stopping to find out.
Come on. Let's find somewhere else to hide.
What?
Well, I don't know. If we go down there we'll bump straight into them. I'm afraid we're trapped.
Just a minute. I think they've gone away.
They didn't seem very friendly, did they? Oh!
Well, it's hot. You try.
There's something moving out there.
I don't know Jamie. Perhaps they're cleaning the windows.
A sensible idea, Zoe. You're sure there's nobody out there?
Mind out, it's hot.
What?
Jamie, I don't think it's any use. You know what I think they've done?
They've welded the lock! We're prisoners!
Jamie, Jamie.
I'm coming down. Look out.
Jamie, I'm afraid that there's nothing on the other side. Just space. It appears that this machine we're on has been blown into about eight separate pieces.
Well, of course I'm sure. Get up and look for yourself if you don't believe me.
Yes, Jamie.
Sabotage perhaps.
I think they were here to defend the machine. That would explain why they were so unfriendly towards us.
No, Zoe, not aimlessly. There appear to be rockets attached to each part of the machine. And they're all moving along together.
Well, as you know, Jamie, when something explodes in space, all the pieces separate and go on separating indefinitely, but this machine has separated just so far, perhaps a mile, and now, as I say, they're all moving together at the same speed.
It looks like it, Zoe.
A mile in space, Jamie, with no oxygen or means of propulsion.
Shush, shush. Just a minute.
Now what on earth is that?
I'm afraid not, Zoe. We've got to conserve it.
Come here, both of you. Look. Look at these.
They're solar powered magnets. It's a force field.
Well, don't you see. The explosive charges that blew this machine apart didn't damage its structure. They simply divided it along the lines of its electromagnetic fields.
Because there was no damage to the structure.
Yes, you see, Jamie, opposite poles attract and the same poles repel.
You see? Try it. There.
Yes.
But it just might, Jamie. Supposing I could step up the electromagnetic power enough to bridge the space between this section and the next.
Yes, and then repeat the process with each section and so on until we reach the Tardis!
Well, I've got a screwdriver.
And I've got a slight knowledge of electromagnetism.
Oh, Jamie, would you move this cylinder out of the way?
Well I don't, Zoe.
Zoe, don't be such a pessimist.
I think that's all we can spare.
I've nearly done it, Jamie. I've just got one more connection to make.
Of course it will work. The theory is perfectly sound.
Yes, yes, it's a little bit of a mess, Jamie, but I can assure you it's thoroughly functional. Thoroughly functional. Here we are. Now you two had better hold on. Are you ready?
Hold tight. Here we go.
I know! I know! I can't turn it off!
Ah! No! I'm stuck. The power's too great.
I'm trying to, Zoe. I'm trying to.
No, Zoe, I'm afraid we're not. Even if I could reverse the magnetic field, I'm afraid we're too far away from the next section.
Yes. Oh, dear. What a silly idiot I am.
Here you are.
I don't need so much as you.
Just a minute, Jamie. Listen.
Wait a minute, Jamie.
Jamie, no!
Look, I think he's just stunned, Zoe. Now, look here, my man, I will not be threatened in this bullying manner! Do you understand?
Pirates? Pirates! Oh, I see!
Oh, Jamie.
Sheer politeness.
Come on.
I told you she was polite.
Oh, we just arrived.
Not so much on it as
Jamie, you're better.
Oh, what on Earth's that?
Hey, wait for me!
Oh, there you are. Who's firing at us? Is it those pirates?
Don't you think it would be wiser to parley with him?
Well, from what Mister Clancey was saying, I imagine it's a metal that's used in the construction of spacecraft. Am I right? MILO: Argonite is used for, well, it's used for practically everything. It's ductile, it's tensile, it's heat-proof, it's practically indestructible.
Magnetically polarised for copper.
I told you already. We don't come from this civilisation. We are visitors.
Well, yes, yes. You've grasped the principle very well.
It's just a minor fault in the system. I shall
Put it right in time.
Oh, yes. By the way, Mister Clancey, would it be going out of your way to drop us off at the space station, please?
Oh, dear. Oh, my word. Do you know where they are?
Oh dear, well, that will be difficult, won't it.
That would be lovely.
Tillium?
Yes, Jamie?
Now, now, now, Jamie. Will power, will power.
Milo?
I've been watching this pressure gauge. It is just a little bit high, isn't it?
Well, except slow down. I mean, there could be a nasty explosion, couldn't there?
Oh? Oh yes. Is it inhabited?
Yes, but if she's a sworn enemy, won't she give you away?
Oh, you've been there before, have you?
Jamie, here. Mining! I see. For argonite, presumably.
You want us to stay here?
Just a minute, where are you going?
I don't know, Jamie. What do you think?
True. But I think we've got to trust him, Jamie. If we leave this ship, we'll never ever have a chance of finding the Tardis again.
A blast furnace, I imagine. I think I think the pirates are probably going to take the pieces and melt them down for the for the argonite. The trouble is, we can't guess where their headquarters is.
What?
Applied? Oh, I see. You've been messing about again, have you?
No, no, no, no, no. Come along, surprise us.
Oh yes.
Yes, circle fourteen. Yes, go on.
Yes, except that after my little experiment, we veered rather violently off that course.
Oh.
Do they really? How interesting. Well, what's the answer?
What?
Oh, bless my soul! Yes, of course. Yes, as you say, a simple calculation. I should have thought of that myself.
Jamie, it's all here, written down. It's as plain as a pike-staff.
Yes, Jamie, you're right.
Yes, I think it's possible.
All right. All right, but if the Tardis has landed here we'll have to find it anyway. Come on, you two, but for heaven's sake don't make a noise on the ladder.
I think we should have done as Milo told us. He said we'd get lost.
Shush. Just a minute, Jamie.
I can hear something.
Seems to be up ahead there.
Where?
Yes, it's reflected through from the other side. I wonder if we can
All right. You jump onto Jamie's back.
There we are. Can you see anything?
Well?
It looks as though we've stumbled on their headquarters. Yes, of course. That noise is an electrical furnace.
Yes. Now the first thing we'd better do is
All right! There's no need for that!
Run!
No.
Just a minute.
I like drawing pins. Ouch. Normally.
Yes.
Oh dear.
Look.
I think it's his shoulder. I think it's only a bruise. It's not broken. Lift him up, very gently. What's this?
Yes, that's all right.
Well, well, it's a long story, but the important thing is to escape from here now.
Oh, no. There's another entrance here somewhere.
There's a hidden door. The problem of course, is going to be finding it.
No, no, no, no. There's obviously a less painful way of getting in here so there must be a way of getting out.
Look. Water, in a fragile bowl. Well that couldn't have been thrown down that chute, now could it?
Patience, Jamie, patience.
It's got to be here. Look.
Yes, but see the way they run.
Yes, well, we're going to go on trying.
There's got to be a control unit here somewhere. Just a question of locating it, that's all.
Shush, shush. Just a minute.
Ah ha. Yes. Yes, it's under there.
An audio lock.
Well, they were used on safes, Jamie. Combination locks became a little too easy to open when burglars took to taking miniature computers with them on their expeditions. Now I have my tuning forks here somewhere.
I usually carry them with. Ah, yes. Here we are, now then, get these sorted out. Right.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
Yes, Jamie, it is! An audio lock is a simple solenoid switch which is only activated by a particular sound. It's just a question of finding it, that's all.
Jamie! Jamie!
Jamie, you found the right note!
Oh no, we can't.
Well they're here, you know. We've seen them.
Well, it might help if you didn't point that thing in our direction.
Well, well, well, yes, yes, if you put it that way.
Shush, shush, there's somebody coming.
What, you mean he got away?
Yes, all right.
Oh dear. Where are we heading for, Milo?
You've changed your mind. Why?
You know this man?
We can't carry him, Milo.
No, Jamie. Come back.
I'm not a magician Zoe, I. What's this?
Really? Oh. Well, I wonder if it's connected up? Oh!
Zoe, attach these to that metal ring there, do you see?
I am hurrying!
Right. Right, over the wire.
Come on. That's it. Now, I'm going to I'm going to test it, so stand clear.
Yes, I think it's working. Right, now you two, you carry along. I'll stay here and help Jamie.
Jamie, wait!
Right. Look! Stand clear.
He means that the argonite pirates are using the old mine workings as a secret hideout.
Yes, there's just got to be. CAVEN: Dyce.
Jamie!
All right, there's no need to shout.
Has anyone got a light? It's very dark in there.
What?
You don't happen to remember where the light switch is, do you Milo?
Ah, well done, Zoe. Yes, a whole box of them.
You take them and I'll show you.
All right, Jamie, I've got some matches. Now, you just light the wick, you see, Zoe, and the wax allows the wick to burn fairly slowly. There we are. My word. Good lord! This is very interesting.
I think somebody's been in here quite recently.
This clock.
It's an eight day movement, Jamie.
Yes, that's what I'm wondering.
What is it?
Jamie? Jamie, let him go.
Well, he's obviously so frightened. We can't make him worse. Look out.
Well, you can't expect him to behave normally. We don't know how long he's been down here.
Milo, go and talk to him quietly.
Talk to him about the things that he might remember.
You mean Caven?
I think we shall get out of here. How long have you been down here?
Well, from what we've seen of Caven, I think he always has a good reason for doing things, Jamie.
Yes, I think so, Zoe. Well, Dom, we shall just have to escape, won't we?
Are you quite sure?
Yes, but it's also the only way in.
Dom, the grille over the door.
I wasn't thinking of brute strength. Well, well not much brute strength.
No, Jamie, it isn't.
Jamie, I think you don't appreciate all I do for you. Milo?
Supposing we could get out of this room, do you think you could find your way back to your spaceship?
Shush!
Splendid! Right, Zoe, hand out those candles. Two at a time will do.
Just a minute, Jamie. I'll tell you. Now, where did I put my bag of marbles?
Right, there we are. I think that should be enough wax.
Well, it usually does. Jamie, Jamie, pass me that marble will you?
The green one. Thank you very much. It's one of my favourites. Now, what have you got, Dom?
That should make plenty of smoke. Right then, is everybody ready?
You all know what you have to do?
Ready?
What's happened to Jamie and Zoe? I think I ought to go back for them MILO: Don't you worry about them. They're probably just checking up we haven't been followed.
What are you doing?
But
I can't understand what's happened to them. I'm going back.
Oh no!
(coughing) Oh dear.
It's all right Jamie, I'm perfectly all right.
I don't think he intended to, Zoe.
Milo wasn't anywhere near the controls when it all happened.
Yes, I think it's the only answer.
I'm not sure, Jamie, but we've got to find that remote control unit and save Milo and Dom. Come on. Oh.
It's all right, Zoe. I'll be all right if you don't fuss me. Come along.
Oh my word! I'm afraid the blast from the gun has fused the wires together.
I think I think that's the air-conditioning circuit reconnected. Now then, the radio link.
Hello LIZ 79. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Dom? Dom Issigri?
Well, I think so.
No, this is much more difficult, I'm afraid.
Well
What is it, Jamie? I'm busy.
What?
Hello, Milo. Now listen.
I think I can help you dismantle the remote control device and regain control of the Liz.
I think the remote control unit will be probably situated somewhere in the computer preselector. Now do you know where that is?
What's happened? Have you found it?
Then we must see to it that he doesn't.
Besides, we shall have to warn them of Caven's intended escape.
There's only one man who can, Jamie. Milo.
I know, I know, but we shall free it.
Get on to the space patrol. Tell them what's happened. I'd better see how Milo's getting on with that bird's nest.
Milo? Have you found that little red wire leading into the neuristor bank?
It sounds as if you've found it.
Now, somewhere near that neuristor bank, there should be the implanted overriding unit. It's probably transistorised. Very small.
What's happening?
Right. Now, dismantle it carefully.
Right, open the doors.
Oh, the Tardis. Well, that's no problem. It's orbiting Lobos, Milo's home planet, in one of the beacon sections.
Milo's very kindly offered us a lift in the Liz.
You never know. You might have to.

There you are, Jo. That's the Master's permanent residence from now on.
Okay.
Right.
Well, I suppose we could always come back later,
Yes, thank you.
What does?
It does indeed.
Well, look, we've been through all that, actually.
That's right, yes.
That was the general idea.
If ever I get the opportunity. Has he given you any trouble as yet?
Has he tried to hypnotise any of the guards, by any chance?
My word, he's putting on weight.
Yes, very impressive. Perhaps we could see him now, yes?
Yes, well, how are you?
Thank you, Colonel.
Very small colony, wasn't it? In fact, I believe they claimed independence soon after he arrived.
You can consider yourself lucky. Quite a few people were in favour of having you executed.
Have you now?
Am I to take it that you're a changed man?
In that case, perhaps you'd like to tell me the whereabouts of your Tardis?
No, so that I can make absolutely certain that you can't.
Ask a silly question. Come on, Jo. I think we'd better be going. Is there anything that I can do for you at all?
Goodbye.
Mmm?
Well, he used to be a friend of mine once. A very good friend. In fact, you might almost say we were at school together.
Forever, I should think.
What, again?
No, indeed. But I advise you to be careful. He's a very dangerous man.
Thank you.
Well, who's trying to hush it up?
You seem to know a great deal about all this.
Well, where's this boat now?
Well, where's this naval base, then?
Right, well, perhaps you'd like to take me there straight away.
Yes, well, you're probably perfectly right. Look, er, I wonder whether you'd like to go and see what's happening to my young friend? She said she was going to buy some picture postcards.
I'd go myself, only my bad leg's playing me up a bit. The Crimea, you know.
Oh, Gallipoli? El Alamein? Does it really matter?
Good afternoon. I wonder whether I could see your commanding officer?
I never carry the things. A lot of bureaucratic nonsense. If you wish to see my pass, then ask Miss Grant.
Well, I just dropped in purely on impulse, old chap. As soon as I heard about that charred lifeboat, I had to see it.
You've inspected the boat yourself?
Then you must have noticed the linear nature of those scorch marks. Excuse me, my dear. May I?
Now then, sit down. Now, the marks are a very definite shape, a linear shape like this. Now, how do you account for that?
Yes, but it didn't catch fire. If it had, the smoke and flames would have been seen, wouldn't they?
A concentrated beam of heat, applied from underneath the boat whilst it was still in the water.
Yes, to make sure there were no survivors. What are these markers here?
Go? My dear chap, I don't want to go. I want to visit this fort here.
Nevertheless, it is right in the centre of all the trouble, isn't it? Now if some of your naval bods could get me out there, Captain?
Look, don't you realise how important this is?
If Horatio Nelson had been in charge of this operation, I hardly think that he would have waited for official instructions.
History books? Captain Hart, Horatio Nelson was a personal friend of mine. Come on, Jo.
Up that ladder. Now hold tight, Jo. We're coming alongside now.
We will, Jo, we will. And we'll take his motor bicycle back at the same time. Still, now we're here, let's take a look around, shall we?
Well, somebody's here all right.
This is a big fort, Jo. They must be in some other part of it. Come on, we'll find them.
There are supposed to be two workmen on this thing. They can't just have vanished.
There's plenty of time.
It must have been the petrol tank.
Don't worry, Jo. There must be a radio on this fort somewhere. We'll just have to get a message back to shore. Come on.
What is it?
He's dead, poor chap.
All right. Let's find that radio first.
Stop! We're friends! Stop!
Come on, Jo, quick. Give me a hand.
We've got to get him into that cabin.
Come on. All right.
Yes.
Now, easy.
Yeah, come on, don't worry. Get yourself down here.
That's right. Mind your head. Mind yourself.
Where's your radio? The radio, where is it?
Over here?
Yes, they certainly did.
Now, listen to me Take this swab, Jo. Swab his arm. Now, are there are more transmitters on this fort?
Any transistor radios, that sort of thing?
It is possible to turn a receiver into a transmitter, you know.
Yes, it's simply a matter of modulating the signal. You connect the output of your loudspeaker into the input of your low frequency amplifier, then you connect the output of your low frequency amplifier into your oscillator. You use your loudspeaker as a microphone and there you are.
Now, where exactly are these transistor radios?
All right. Thank you. Now don't worry, this is not going to hurt you. All right? Now you'll soon be all right.
Soon feel better. Look after him, will you, Jo?
Don't be alarmed. I've no wish to harm you.
Now, wait. We must talk.
Wire?
Just as I thought. Reptiles, like those creatures in the caves. It's completely hostile. Here, hang on to this. Tight! Hang on.
Those creatures can cut through anything. Rock, metal, anything.
Come on. Give me a hand.
We've got to get after that creature. Now, come on.
Nearly finished. Just about to test it.
Certainly I do. I'll prove it to you. Right, here goes.
I think I must have got me wires crossed somewhere.
Thanks.
Mmm?
Something very similar, certainly. They emerged from some caves in Derbyshire.
That's a complete misnomer. The chap who discovered them must have got the period wrong. No, properly speaking, they should have been called the Eocenes.
That's right, and if you want my opinion, there's another of their colony right here beneath us.
Probably the rebuilding of this fort.
Well, this is a different species, completely adapted to life underwater.
Very likely.
They still think of Earth as their planet, Jo, and they want it back. As far as they're concerned, man is just an ape who got above himself. Right, I think that should do it. Let's have another go. Hello, hello. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday! This is, er, this, er, this is. What is this? What's our call sign?
Hello, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, this is Oscar Bravo Tango Seven Four. We are stranded on this fort and have a wounded man here. Can you send immediate assistance? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Over.
Hello, Oscar Bravo Tango speaking. Who are you? Who are you? Over.
Yes. Well, though I say so myself, I think that's a remarkably efficient piece of work.
Even you must admit that something happened on that fort!
Well, to begin with, we must make every effort to make contact with them.
It may still be possible to find a peaceful solution. We're not dealing with animals, Captain Hart, we're dealing with intelligent beings.
Colonel Trenchard.
Yes, why don't you do that, Colonel? Captain Hart is likely to be very busy from now on.
It entirely depends how long it takes me to conclude my business. Good day, Colonel.
Where were we indeed? Ships must be kept away from this area.
You'll have even bigger protests if ships go on sinking.
You'll just have to patrol the area, won't you?
You don't seem to realise how dangerous
What?
Jo, please, not now.
What? Where?
Captain Hart, I suggest that you order a full security alert immediately.
Miss Grant has just seen a very dangerous criminal on your base.
Come on.
What did this officer look like?
Trenchard.
Well, don't you see? He arrived just before this happened and he left a few moments ago.
Yes, I certainly am. Captain Hart, can you lend me some transport?
No time to explain now. Come on, Jo.
Colonel Trenchard.
I've reason to believe that your prisoner has escaped.
It is?
Yes, you do that.
Try and get an outside line. No, they're both completely dead. Now listen, Jo. I want you to take the jeep, go down to the naval base and call UNIT. Tell them that Colonel Trenchard and his entire staff are to replaced immediately.
No buts, Jo. Just do as I ask.
Now, don't worry about me. I'll stay here and keep an eye on him. Now, you hurry.
Fore!
You were saying, Colonel?
Oh, she's gone back to the naval base.
Oh, I've just seen him.
Yes, on there.
If you insist.
Been out for a little jaunt, have you?
Why did you go to the naval stores and steal those electronic spares?
You've got some sort of hold over Colonel Trenchard. What's going on?
Good afternoon!
Akidai!
Like that is it?
I wouldn't do that if I were you. That's government property.
I always find that violent exercise makes me hungry. Don't you agree?
Oh, you think so?
Ah, but you haven't seen the quality of my footwork yet!
Tut, tut, tut. How many times have I told you? Violence will never get you anywhere.
Only a complete fool would listen to such an accusation. Though I suppose in your case.
Oh, don't be absurd, man.
If you must continue with this ridiculous charade. Only take care not to lose him this time, won't you?
Have you any idea why Colonel Trenchard is taking orders from the Master? Look, man, I'm talking to you.
Very well.
Is that what the Master told you to say?
I've done no such thing. The Master knocked that guard out himself, as you very well know.
That's absolute rubbish. Anybody at UNIT headquarters will vouch for me, if you'll permit me to use the telephone.
Colonel Trenchard, why are you allowing the Master to use you like this?
Look, you're jeopardising your entire career.
Didn't anybody else warn you about the Master? Whatever he's told you, it's all lies.
You really think you can keep me here?
I see. Thank you. Thank you very much.
I hadn't really anything better to do.
Thank you.
How very kind of you.
How very unkind of you.
I'm very relieved to hear it.
Your usual childish desire to gloat, perhaps?
Everything. I sent them a full report as soon as Miss Grant spotted you at the naval base.
Well, you'll find out soon enough.
And how would you explain that away to Colonel Trenchard? I'm hardly in a position to attack you, now am I?
Whatever you're up to, you still need Trenchard's cooperation. You're still a prisoner here, you know.
Then why don't you?
How do you know about them?
More stolen information?
Well, why do you want to contact them?
I still don't see why you want to help them. What can you possibly gain?
Better run along, old chap. You're still a prisoner here, you know.
You'll never get it off the ground.
Anyone out there?
I said, is there anyone out there?
Look, guard, I want to talk to you. I said I want to talk to you!
How much longer am I going to be kept chained up like this?
What about the Geneva convention?
What about some food, then? I'm sure they didn't tell you to starve me to death.
You tell Colonel Trenchard that I want to see him straight away. He's got no right to keep me here like this.
(silent) You'll find tools over there.
(sotto) Behind the door.
Guard! Guard. Guard! I want to talk to you!
These handcuffs. They're far too tight. They're killing me.
After you.
No, no. After you.
Come on, Jo! Come on!
There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go through the minefield.
No, don't worry.
My sonic screwdriver. It converts into rather a good mine detector.
Look out. Look, there's one over there. Now, you'll have to move round to the right. Now follow me.
Relax, Jo, relax.
Right, follow me.
Hold still. Hold still.
Right. We've got to get back to Captain Hart. Come on.
Well, I can assure you we didn't walk ten miles across open countryside just to tell you fairy stories.
I doubt it. The Master's got some sort of hold over him.
All right, Jo, all right, all right. Let me deal with the explanations. Look, it's like this
For heaven's sakes, Jo. What do you think this is, a picnic?
All right, well let's forget about the Sea Devils. What about Trenchard trying to take us prisoners then?
All right, what about the theft of your electronic spares? Surely you'll agree that happened?
Well, he's developed some way of communicating with them. Probably a ultra-high frequency sonic beam. These are rather good. Want one?
Sandwich?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
How overdue is the submarine?
It should never have been sent, you know. They were bound to presume it was hostile.
Captain Hart, you are dealing with a situation completely outside of your own experience. And if you won't let me help you
Well, the key to this whole situation is at the castle.
You see where the thing's heading? That beach by castle! Perhaps you'll believe me now.
Perhaps they can't.
Captain Hart, we've got to find out what's happening at that castle.
The Master had no further use for him, that's why.
What would you say was Trenchard's strongest characteristic?
Exactly. And the Master used that patriotism as a weapon.
The submarine?
The fort. Look, Captain Hart, can you lay on a diving vessel?
I want to inspect the sea bed at the base of that fort.
Yes, positive.
If you don't mind, I'd rather go down on my own.
Naturally. What's more, I know these creatures. I've encountered them before so I know what I'm looking for.
What is it, Jo?
How else am I going to make contact?
Thank you, Captain Hart.
Yes, thank you, Chief.
Splendid, thank you. A most interesting trip.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Right.
Yes, I'm fine, thank you.
Hang on a minute!
Definitely not! I think I've just (static)
Your people went into hibernation and abandoned Earth to its fate.
Yes, but the catastrophe that you predicted never happened. And the apes that you left behind on the surface to die became man.
Yes. Yes, I've encountered your people before. That is why I want to prevent a conflict that can only end in your destruction.
Yes, and already more ships are being sent to hunt you down.
You may win a few victories to begin with but eventually you're bound to lose.
But there's no need for a war. Why can't you share the planet?
The depths of the sea and those areas on Earth where man cannot live can be yours.
There's a chance. Wouldn't it be better to try for a peace, than to launch yourself into a war that you cannot possibly win?
Let me return to the humans, and I will endeavour to make a peace for you.
I beg you not to listen to this man. He's the personification of evil.
He wants only to provoke a war.
Why should you need his help?
But why revive your people only to have them killed? Let me try and negotiate that peace for you.
Yes. I tried to make peace but I failed.
Believe me, man is not weak. He's only too proficient at devising weapons of annihilation and using them.
If you'll release the submarine and its crew, yes, as a gesture of good faith.
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Er, look, would you mind keeping back for a moment? That is if you want to get out? Thank you!
Look, I've no time to explain now. Where are the rest of your men?
Is the submarine still operational?
Where's the sub now?
Can you find the way?
Right, you'd better lead on. Here, take this. It's a gun. Now come on, let's hurry.
No, no! Don't kill him!
There's no need to have done that!
They're holding us back with some kind of force field.
Well, you could try firing your torpedoes at the cave wall and blasting yourselves free.
That's a risk you'll have to take.
Well, hurry up and fire those torpedoes, or we'll be drawn back into the cave.
Well, come on, man! You've got to risk it!
Dead? No, I don't think so.
Captain Hart, what idiot ordered an all out attack just as I was on the verge of finding a peaceful solution?
You ordered the attack?
Did you give any thought at all, sir, as to what you were doing?
That, sir, is an extremely insular point of view. At the precise moment of the attack, I was negotiating a peace.
But the point, Mister Parliamentary Private Secretary, is that you have not destroyed. You have just made them angry. Very, very angry!
But that, sir, would be tantamount to murder.
You can share it with them, surely?
Look, let me make one final attempt to negotiate.
Just you think of it, sir. Think of it. Wouldn't you like to be the man behind a peaceful settlement? Walker the peacemaker, they'd call you. Or would you prefer to be known as the man responsible for launching a full scale war!
Yes.
Just leave it to me.
Jo, it's the only way.
Don't you understand, Jo? I've got to go down there of my own free will as a gesture of good faith. Captain Hart, is that diving vessel still alongside?
Then with your permission, Mister Walker? (to Blythe) My cape.
I'm doing the only thing possible, Captain Hart, if we're to avoid a major conflict.
All right, Captain Hart, get these two out of here.
How do you hope to achieve that?
You haven't reactivated them yet, have you.
I wondered why I was still alive.
And how do you hope to do that?
And you've convinced your reptilian friends that this will work?
Hmm. Yes, I suppose it's possible.
Good grief! What on Earth do you think you're doing?
Well, this circuit here, it's completely misplaced. And also you'll need far more power through to your main dipode. Give me a pencil, will you?
Thank you.
Yes, I think so, given time. Now then, let's see.
Oh, I need a polarising condenser.
Oh, thank you.
Now Jo, listen to me. In a few minutes time, I'm going to create a diversion. Now, as soon as it starts, you try and get Hart and the others out.
Don't worry about the guards. You leave them to me. Now, you hurry back there and wait for the off.
All right?
How about a little test? Right, here goes.
I must have had the frequency too high. I'm sorry about that. Oh, no, I see what it is. I had the output jack in the input socket. There. Yeah, there that should work all right now.
We?
Oh, I see.
If you insist.
Well, it seems as if things aren't quite going according to plan.
Look out behind you!
Yes, I am. This man is an extremely dangerous criminal, so guard him well. Now, have you seen Captain Hart and Miss Grant?
Right, I'd better go and find them.
Yeah, do that. And watch him!
Have you seen Jo Grant anywhere?
Don't listen to him. Why begin a long and bloody war where thousands will be killed on both sides?
Is there nothing I can say to make you reconsider?
I'm sorry.
The power may take some time to build up, you know.
You seem to be losing your touch.
I very much doubt it. You see, before you reactivated it, I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow.
Oh, yes. Do you?
Exactly. In about ten minutes from now the whole place should go up. Enjoy your revenge.
You're wasting your time, you know. Even if they heard you, they couldn't do anything about it.
Well, I built a self-destruct mechanism into the main control switch. You can't turn it off.
That's right. Unless we can both escape.
You see? Come on.
Well, just as I told you. Submarine escape equipment. Now, all we've got to do is find the airlock.
Yes, there must be one around here somewhere. Otherwise how else did we get down in those capsules? Here you are. Put this on.
It's the Master. He collapsed soon after they picked us up.
I managed to destroy their base for you.
Well, I did what I had to to prevent a war.
Doctor? What doctor?

Nasty. Very nasty.
Shush. I don't know. It will be all right. It just has a little corrosion in its circuits.
Never.
What did you say, Leela?
I heard what you said.
Leela, I understand the Tardis perfectly. There's not one single part of her that I haven't adjusted or repaired at some time or another.
Furthermore, I am in complete and constant control of her.
Someone's using a sonic time scan. Come on, old girl. Don't let us down now. Come on.
We're being dragged towards a relative continuum displacement zone.
A relative continuum displacement. It's like a hole in time.
I wish I knew.
That depends on this misunderstood, unmanageable old machine.
She's turning.
She's done it. Well done, old girl. You're wonderful. Wonderful. She's wonderful. Isn't she wonderful? Tardis wonderful!
Yeah, well, she just generates a low intensity telepathic field, and obviously primitive thought patterns like yours appeal to her.
Yes.
That's odd.
What? No, no, no. I can't calculate the coordinates.
We'll just have to trace the scan back to its source.
We have to stop it being used, certainly, otherwise it'll cause a direct continuum implosion and destroy the planet it's operating from.
It can't be. Oh, no.
Not that one.
Not there.
Earth.
Yes. Your ancestors have a talent for self-destruction that borders on genius.
I like your new dress.
It's a pleasure.
Earth.
Oh, yes. Oh, well, more or less. I haven't pinpointed it definitely, but it's certain to be around here somewhere.
No, no, no. The one who leads says come on. Come on.
Good morning, ladies. Now, which one of you has the time scanner, hmm?
I did say more or less, though this does look rather less than more. You know, I don't think these cows know anything about the time scanner. Never mind. It's a beautiful day. The exercise will do us good. Come on.
Hmm?
You must have been sent by Providence.
No. Would you like a jelly baby?
Frequently. What's the nearest village?
Fetchborough. Tell me about the ghosts.
The strangers, then.
Yes, Fendelman. Tell me about him.
Japanese?
They do? Splendid.
Or archaeologists. Where is this Priory?
And it's haunted, of course.
Shush. Don't you worry. What's your name?
Ted Moss? Hmm. Don't you worry, Mister Moss. We won't tell a soul, living or dead. Come on, Leela.
What is it?
No.
You'll upset the dog. Listen, Leela, you simply must stop attacking people.
Because you'll get us into trouble.
What? You'll protect me? Come on, we'll circle round the back. Come on!
The house must be that way. Now come on.
All right, now whatever you do, stay close to me, you understand? Leela?
Leela! She's done it again.
Come on, legs. Come on, you can do it. Pull yourself together. Come on now, lift.
Left, right, left. That's it, legs, run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
Don't touch her. I said don't touch her!
How many deaths have there been?
Like this.
No, no, no, no, no, you look.
They look like embryo Fendahleen to me.
Come and sit down. You'll be all right.
Embryo Fendahleen. A creature from my own mythology. Supposed to have perished when the fifth planet broke up. At least, so they said.
Well, you saw it. If it survived twelve million years, it's energy reserves must be enormous.
What? Well, about twelve million. That's when the fifth planet broke up. There are four thousand million people here on your planet, and if I'm right, within a year there'll be just one left alive. Just one.
Who's in charge round here?
Ah, Doctor Fendelman, I presume. Is that really your name, Fendelman? Now listen, Fendelman, I want you to do two things. Dismantle the scanner and run some tests on Miss Thea. Start with an x-ray of her skull. Now
Is this the way you treat all your houseguests?
But she needs help!
Tell Fendelman there isn't time for all this!
Ah. Parastatic magnetometer. How very quaint.
Hmm. Twelfth century.
Oh. Oh. Would you like a jelly baby? No, I don't suppose you would. Alas, poor skull.
No, no.
How did you find me?
Yes.
Yes, of course you did.
What?
Yes. I was careless. Come on, get up. Come on.
You're becoming a metracion generator, aren't you.
Yes. It's using appropriate genetic material to recreate itself.
Shush. I think it's the Fendahl. It grows and exists by death.
The Fendahl absorbs the full spectrum of energy, what some people call a life force or soul. It eats life itself.
What?
And she's still alive?
Take me to her.
It's indestructible.
No, no, first thing's first. Fendelman can operate that before the implosion for about a hundred hours, give or take a few minutes.
That's a risk I'll have to take. Come on, let's go.
Come on, Mrs Tyler, wake up.
Do you know what's wrong with her?
I do. Make some tea.
Tea. She does drink tea?
Off you go and make some. Use the best china. Four cups laid out on a tray. Off you go. Oh, and some fruitcake.
No.
I love fruitcake. Come on, Mrs Tyler. This is no way to behave when you've got visitors. We've come for tea.
And fruitcake.
Then you mix the peanuts with the treacle
Throw in the apple cores very hard, put the lot in a shallow tin and bake in a high oven for two weeks. (sotto) It's too late. She's slipping away. Come on.
What is it?
Mrs Tyler! (laughs)
You were slipping away, Mrs Tyler.
Yes, psychic shock. I needed something normal to bring you back to reality. How long have you lived here, Mrs Tyler?
Tell her I'm trying to help.
Yes. So you've lived in this cottage all your life, haven't you, Mrs Tyler.
Well, telepathy and precognition are normal in anyone whose childhood was spent near a time fissure, like the one in the wood.
It's a weakness in the fabric of space and time. Every haunted place has one, doesn't it? That's why they're haunted. It's a time distortion. This one must be very large. Large enough to have affected the place names round here. Like Fetchborough. Fetch. An apparition, hmm?
I read a lot. What did you see in the wood, Mrs Tyler?
Then with your mind. Did it have a human shape?
Mrs Tyler, I must know. Did it have a human shape?
Mrs. Jack, do something for me.
It could be dangerous.
I want you to keep an eye on the Priory. I must know who comes and goes. We'll be back tomorrow sundown.
The fifth planet's a hundred and seven million miles out and twelve million years back, so we've no time to lose.
Well, it came from it a long time ago, before your species evolved on Earth.
What?
Well, it. Well, it probably used that enormous stockpile of energy to project itself across space.
No. Yes, well, something like that. Humans speak of astral projection, travelling psychically to different planets. That could be a race memory.
Yes. You see, sometimes people dream they've been to other places. It's, er, dj vu. No?
No, no, no. Put it away, put it away. It's a good thing your tribe never developed guns. They'd have woken with a start one morning and wiped themselves out.
I've been checking the old data banks. There's no record at all of a fifth planet.
Well of course it matters! We Time Lords are a very meticulous people. You have to be when you live as long as we do. All information is recorded.
What?
What?
Of course. That's why there's no record of the planet.
That impression's produced by a time loop.
Yes, a time loop. All memory of a planet's been erased by a circle of time, making data and its records invisible. Only a Time Lord could do that.
That's criminal! We've been on a wild goose chase. We'd better get back. Let's hope we're not too far round that time loop.
Yes. No, no. I'll just set the coordinates and we're on our way.
Well of course we're going to be late! It's obvious we're going to be late! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The question is, where is it getting the power from? Inducted biological transmutation takes a lot of power. There isn't that sort of power available in the Priory.
I've got it. It is available in the Priory. The skull's absorbing the energy released when the scanner beam damages the time fissure. Why didn't I think of that before?
I can't?
No. Well, I should have thought it. I was frightened in childhood by a mythological horror.
Too frightened to think clearly.
Are you all right?
Come on, let's get out of here.
What?
Shush. It's psychotelekinetic. It controls your muscles telepathically.
No matter. It's confused that I can still move. Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes! Now concentrate on your legs, and when I shout, run!
Run! Come on!
Run for your life!
Rock salt.
Well done. Well done. That sort of control's almost impossible to break.
No, it wasn't. It was a Fendahleen. It was the same think that killed the hiker and Mitchell. It can only have been created out of pure energy while the skull was restructuring Thea's brain.
What's that for?
That's it! Leela, you'd better come with me. Jack, stay with your grandma. We'd better find out what's going on down there.
Shush. Shush. Get him out of here as soon as you can. Whatever you do, don't look at her eyes. Shush. Don't look at her eyes.
Come on. Come on. It's too late. You've seen her eyes.
What?
It won't have any effect on her.
I'm sorry.
Put that away. You almost got us killed down there.
Shush. (to Martha) The darkness, is it all around us?
Come on. Let's have a look at the one I assaulted.
Hmm, beautiful.
Yes, sodium chloride. Obviously affects the conductivity, ruins the overall electrical balance and prevents control of localised disruption to the osmotic pressures.
I just said that. Probably the origin of throwing it over your shoulder. Come on.
Whew. Well, I've saved the planet, but we're too late for the Fendahl.
Oh no, that was just a lucky shot up the throat. It's not a throat of course
True, but that was just an isolated Fendahleen, comparatively weak. What's in the cellar is the Fendahl, the gestalt.
Shush. Got it. According to the legends of Gallifrey, and the superstitions of this planet, it's fairly certain that the Fendahl is made up of twelve Fendahleen and a core.
Well, yes, what was Thea. It's no longer Thea no more than. I killed one, and Stael shot himself. There are only ten left.
Yes, we've still got a chance. Jack?
Any more of those salt-filled cartridges?
I need rock salt, quickly.
Mrs Tyler, you're wonderful. Jack, fix those cartridges. Now, Mrs Tyler, I need as much salt as you can find. Rock salt, table salt. Fill as many containers as you can. Off you go.
Jack? Now listen very carefully. Go out into the corridor and keep watch. When you see the Fendahleen, don't hang around. Give it both barrels and run. Off you go.
Leela?
Go with him.
Yes.
Mmm.
Yes. In other words, the Fendahl. And then the Time Lords decided to destroy the entire planet, and hid the fact from posterity. They're not supposed to do that sort of thing, you know.
Yes, probably taking in Mars on it's way through.
The Fendahl is death. How do you kill death? No, what happened was this. The energy amassed by the Fendahl was stored in the skull and dissipated slowly as a biological transmutation field. Now, any appropriate lifeform that came within the field was altered so that it ultimately evolved into something suitable for the Fendahl to use.
No, I'm saying it may have effected his evolution.
That would explain the dark side of man's nature. But it's just a theory.
It's more fun that way.
Almost there. Oh, if you want an alternative explanation, the Fendahl fed into the RNA of certain individuals the instincts and compulsions necessary to recreate. These were fed through the generations till they reached Fendelman and people like him.
Or on the other hand, it could all be just a coincidence. Finished.
Find Mrs Tyler. Give her a hand with the salt. Time's running out.
Leela! Leela!
Yes. Yes, you did. You're quite right, Leela. Good marksmanship isn't a matter of luck. Come on.
Shush. Right, battle stations. Jack, you and your grandma, back to the cottage.
Shush. You know what to do.
Good man.
Lead lined?
Perfect. Right, now this is what I want you to do. Give Leela and me time to get down to the cellar, and then switch on the scanner beam. With luck it should confuse things down there long enough for us to grab the skull and get away.
Listen. This is important. Be sure to operate the scanner beam for only two minutes, then switch if off and you go.
Because I've rigged that to set off a controlled implosion three minutes after you switch off the scanner. We need three minutes to get clear.
Pretty big. Big enough to blow this place to atoms.
Oh no, too dangerous. It could pop up anywhere and start the whole thing over again. Come on.
Psst. Remember, three minutes.
No, better save some for later.
Come on, I've got it. Let's get out of here.
He's switched off the scanner beam. We've got three minutes. Come on!
No, don't!
Come on, run!
Leela, where are you?
Then come on! Run!
Down!
We leave. Vanishing priories take a lot of explaining.
Yes. Probably at Mrs Tyler's now, eating plum cake off her best china.
Hmm? Oh, find a star about to go supernova and dump it in the vicinity.
Oh, yes. I don't think even that can stand the temperatures generated by a supernova. Ah!
Found one, in the constellation of Canthares. Just set the coordinates, and we're on our way.
I like your new dress.
Oh, yes. It has a certain, je ne, je, er.
What?
Didn't finish what?
Oh, yes, yes. Well, it's about K, K
K9. Yes. I'd better finish repairing him.
I can call K9 him if I want to. He's my dog. Aren't you, K9?

Lovely, lovely, lovely.
Well, let's explore shall we?
Yes, twin suns. It's bound to be hot.
No, no, no, no, the instruments in the Tardis would have told us. No it's a, it's a mixture of ozone and sulphur. Very bracing!
Oh, fascinating structures. Magnesium silicate.
Dead, is it?
Yes, fascinating architecture. It's more typical of a low gravity planet, and yet I think this is quite normal. Yes.
Yes, possibly.
Come on, let's see what he's up to. Be careful.
I hardly think so, Zoe.
Oh this is interesting!
Metal? Would you say so? I think we'd better get away from here.
Come along.
Well, this isn't a building, this is a machine. Come along.
Come on, quickly. Behind the rocks. (The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe hide behind a convenient boulder and watch Abu totter out, somewhat dazed but still wearing his cape. Two nozzles emerge from either side of the door.)
Shush!
I don't know, Jamie. Come on, let's get away from here.
Now just leave this to me, Zoe.
We are friends!
It's all right. Now don't be afraid.
But, but, one of your people has been
There's no time for explanations! As I say, one of your people has been
Look, we are friendly.
Oh, I don't think so, Zoe. They're too civilised for that.
Well, we can try. Just a minute. Wait!
Now Jamie, don't be so rash.
Jamie!
That was the very question I was going to ask you! What is happening here? Where has that girl gone?
There is no time to explain!
That girl. Now where has she gone?
What's behind that wall?
How do you open this door?
Because a moment ago we saw a young man dressed in a silver robe just like that girl. We saw him killed!
Well, it may have been poisoned once, but I can assure you it's quite safe now.
Oh Jamie, you're right. We must save her!
Well, come on!
I wonder how long. I imagine we haven't much time.
You keep away, Zoe. Keep right away.
Well, Mister?
Yes, well you can find some more stones like this.
Well, if you want to help! Now then.
Yes, that one.
Right! Come down here.
Yes Zoe, so can I.
The vandals. Look at that.
My favourite umbrella.
Let me see. Oh dear, this is almost catatonic. ZOE: Isn't there anything you can do?
I'm not a Doctor of medicine you know, Zoe. However, if there's no damage to the tissue. Is there anywhere we can take her?
Well, let's take her there. Give me a hand. Come on, Jamie.
You're resting. You're calmly resting. Your mind is quite empty. You're resting. Now, you're going to sleep, Vana. Sleep. Feeling sleepy. Very sleepy. Sleep.
She's asleep at last.
Well, I hope so, Jamie. It's difficult to tell.
Thank you.
Oh really? Competition for you, Zoe.
How did all this begin, Selris?
And everyone uses these machines?
Whose law, Selris?
But I thought you said all your laws were given you by the Krotons?
I see. A sort of self-perpetuating slavery. And the Krotons always choose your two most promising students?
Hmm? Well, it's time it was stopped, anyway. It's high time it was stopped.
Another war between your people and the Krotons, you mean.
Not if we cut through the wasteland.
Oh, that wore off a long time ago. It's quite safe now.
Stop it. Stop it, all of you! Listen to me. This will do no good at all. These Krotons must have enormous scientific powers. You can't defeat them with axes!
Now, if this was an atomic laser, it might be more use.
I think something's coming out now.
I don't know, Zoe, but keep well clear of it.
It's all right, Zoe. I think it's quite safe now.
Just watch this, Jamie.
Yes, and the pattern is my face.
Yes, so it seems. It's rather flattering, isn't it.
Yes. That means they must have a scanner in the wall of the machine. Now if we can find that, we might be able to get in touch with them.
Yes. That poor fellow must have confused it's attack mechanism.
Well, it was programmed to kill once. Me! It must think that it's succeeded, stupid machine.
I borrowed it from Beta.
They don't. That works on stored solar energy. Yes, the Gonds are quite advanced in some ways. Their medicine's very good, but they haven't got much general chemistry. I wish they had an ETC machine though.
Yes. And the machines are programmed by the Krotons, so the gaps in their knowledge may be significant. Ah, Selris.
Well I think she's better. It's difficult to tell. Selris, is it safe to enter the Learning Hall yet?
Zoe and I want to have a look round, don't we, Zoe?
Yes, that's right. Jamie, hold out your hand, will you?
These pills I got from Beta.
No, no. They're for Vana. I want you to stay and look after her.
Because I particularly want you to give her those pills the moment she wakes up.
To learn, Zoe. Why else?
Oh, my dear fellow, there's no need for that.
Oh. Well, certainly. Come along, Zoe.
Selris, what's that?
Oh? What's down there?
I wonder how far underneath? Let's have a look, shall we?
Oh, yes, it's a bit dark and musty down here. Zoe, stay up there, will you? We shan't be long.
Ah, but there was, Selris. Something rather curious.
Zoe!
Zoe!
What do you think you're doing?
You should know better than to do a thing like that.
Very pleased?
Zoe! Now, just you listen to me. Whatever else they are, these Krotons are certainly not friendly. Now we know that, don't we?
They use these machines to plant impressions on the mind. That's how they've enslaved these people all these years.
What?
Oh? What of it?
Yes, well, Zoe is something of a genius. Of course it can be very irritating at times.
Yes, it's hard but it's not brittle. I've never seen anything quite like it.
Mm? Oh, what Selris calls the foundations. Zoe, it was like a root structure.
That this so-called machine is organic in structure. Yes.
Well, why not? Some crystals do resemble simple virus forms. I wish I could get a bit of it for analysis.
Well all life doesn't necessarily have feeling, you know.
Great jumping gobstoppers! What's that?
Oh, what does it say?
Zo-Gond? Zoe! They mean you!
And we all know what happens to them, don't we?
Well, she doesn't have to go, does she? Well, does she or doesn't she?
They'll destroy you, I see.
Now do you see what you've done? Fooling around with this stupid machine!
But that machine doesn't know that!
I'm going to take the test. I can't let you go in there alone! What do I do?
All right, there's no need to shout! Now go away and don't fuss me. No, come back. What's this? It's all right, I know. Right, fire away. I'm ready.
Oh dear, I've been working in square roots. Can I have that again, please?
Oh, now what have I done?
I am, Zoe! I am!
Yes. I think that's rather better. I think I've scored more than you have, Zoe.
It's clever, isn't it? The way they make you feel that they're pleased with you.
What? Of course they are! What happens now?
Well, they can wait. We are going in there together.
Sounds a bit like a dinner gong, doesn't it Zoe?
Doctor-Gond. Idiots!
Yes. Well, are you ready?
Well, we started this, we'd better go through with it. We've got to get to the bottom of this somehow, Zoe.
Oh, cheer up, cheer up. I expect it'll be quite interesting really.
Eh? Oh. Oh, that's very nice of them. Stay close to me, Zoe.
Yes, but there doesn't seem to be any crew. Hello? Anybody there? Is anybody at home? Hello?
Yes, I think we have, Zoe. Er, Zoe, hold onto the end of this chain.
Look up there. It's a force generator. This chain may help to equalise the power load.
No, it's a forcefield. Try and relax. Relax.
Are you all right, Zoe? Oh!
Oh!
Oh, some tremendous power. Oh!
Yes. And they used it, or rather us, to operate a thermal switch.
Yes.
Yes, there was. Zoe, I think that I'm beginning to understand.
That's curious. Zoe, I think we've gone and done it.
Well, now just a minute, I've got an idea.
Oh, yes. This is a form of slurry. Crystals in suspension.
Well, life is supposed to have begun on your planet in the sea. Primeval soup, someone once called it. Well, there are lots of sorts of soups, aren't there? I wonder what this sort is?
Yes, I think you're right, Zoe. Zoe, look!
I think it's time we got out of here. Come along!
Yes, we have, once we can analyse this. Now, come on.
Yes, there must be a trip-mechanism.
Well, if it's not working.
Yes.
Just a moment, I have an idea.
That piece of mica I picked up. Here we are. Now, if I can use it to bridge the gap.
Well, the whole machine's made of crystal.
Wait! The poison jet.
Yes, but jump down to the side. Don't go down the ramp.
No, it's the way to the Tardis.
Well, don't worry about him. He's perfectly safe, isn't he? Come on!
So, these creatures have a life system based on tellurium, eh? It's fascinating, isn't it Zoe? Then that tank must have been a polarised centrifuge.
Oh, don't blame yourself, Zoe. That machine must have lain around for thousands of years waiting for someone as clever as us to turn up.
Yes, that's horrible. Still, you must admit, that it's a very good way of existing through time.
Oh, there's some deposits of sulphur around here somewhere.
Hydrogen telluride.
The worst smell in any world.
Zoe, I'd say it was a safe bet that that machine is composed of tellurium.
Oh, it'll come in useful. It's very useful stuff, sulphur, you know. Very useful stuff indeed.
Look at this. It's almost pure sulphur.
Yes, in a minute. What do you know about tellurium, Zoe?
Yes.
Mmm hmm. Well, go on.
Oh, my giddy aunt.
Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Well, yes, if you put it that way. I wonder perhaps if I were to
Oh, yes. Yes!
Quick, Zoe. Up there. Run!
No, apparently not in the light. It was dark in the machine, wasn't it.
Yes.
Yes, it's being directed by the machine's scanners.
Yes.
Well, there's nothing we can do till that wretched Kroton moves away.
Yes, what a stupid place to land. You can tell that the Captain is not at the helm, can't you?
Well it only does that, you see, if I remember to set the HADS.
The HADS. The Hostile Action Displacement System. If the Tardis is attacked, it automatically dematerialises. Now, I think it's safe for us to move now.
Well, er, we've got to tell the Gonds that we're all right, haven't we? And Jamie'll be worried. Come along, now. Carefully.
Yes, I'm sorry we've been so long.
Oh yes, well, we did, but, er, well, what goes in must come out, mustn't it? You're better, aren't you. Sit down.
You mustn't. Oh, I'm glad to see you're going on holiday.
Well it looks as though
Evacuated? What do you mean?
But didn't he learn his lesson last night?
Oh, I don't think that's a very good idea! Zoe, there's no time to be lost. Will you take us to Beta, please?
Can you hold my bag please? There's a small job I want you to do.
It's sulphur. I've written out some instructions here. I don't know whether you can follow them. Can you?
Yes. Beta, did it ever occur to you to wonder why?
I haven't seen him since this morning.
Come on. We must go.
Give me a sample of that as soon as you can. (The Doctor and Zoe leave.)
Stop it! Stop it!
What do you think you're doing, you idiots? Unhook the thing! You're meddling with things you don't understand!
Zoe! Run! Run!
Yes, yes, I think so. I don't think there's any bones broken. But if they don't get that vibration under control soon
Oh, look out!
Thara! Oh, don't worry, we'll get it off you. Zoe! Zoe!
Yes, well, hurry up, Zoe. We've got to move out of here, you know.
Oh, that was not an earthquake.
Yes. That means the Krotons are free to deal with us. Haven't you finished yet, Zoe?
No! Here, I'd much rather you use this. (pocket handkerchief)
Hello.
I'm not so sure - look at that.
I'd say it was no longer functioning under full power. Vana, how is Beta getting on with the acid I asked him to make?
Oh good.
Yes, basically, with a few things added. Don't touch, it'll burn you.
Jamie! I'd forgotten all about him in the excitement!
Followed us? What, in there?
Yes, and if the machine rejects him like the others? Come on!
Jamie!
Jamie, watch out for the poison jets! (Zoe and the Doctor run up the ramp.)
We've got to get you out of here!
Jamie!
I think you're getting free.
Oh!
There's no time to explain, Jamie. How are you feeling?
Good.
There's something I want you to do for me.
Now Beta is making some special sulphuric acid for us. I want you to go and tell him to make it in bulk.
As much as he can.
There's no time to argue. Now hurry. We'll see you back at the Learning Hall.
Well, if only we can get inside that machine again, Zoe.
Oh?
Oh, that's very good of (guards surround them) What? What's all this?
Really! We will not be bullied. Don't push! (sotto) Vana! Vana, have you got that bottle? It's vital!
Yes. Vana? Oh.
I believe you wish to speak with us.
Look out!
Assist you? In what way?
No, no, Zoe. If this machine does run down, there will be the most colossal release of energy. Enough to destroy us, the Krotons and most of the planet. If you want us to help you, you must explain what you want us to do. What is this thing?
You've discovered a way of using mental power?
If you want us to cooperate, you must expect questions.
Very well. But that won't help you, will it.
Oh, I see. And you set the machine's systems to educate the Gonds up to the standard you require.
Now, just a moment. If we're going to help you transfer the Dynatrope back to your own planet, what's going to happen to us?
Well, how can we be sure of that? We die without oxygen, you see, just as you would die if anyone was to upset the stuff you're drawing from that tank.
I was merely trying to explain that if anyone was to contaminate what was in that tank, you'd know what it was like to breathe poisoned air.
Oh well, I suppose we'd better just take your word for it then.
Oh. Now then, where do you want us to stand?
Oh. Well, I'll stand over here then.
Oh, my dear. Oh well, you stand there and I'll stand here. Better still. A much better idea. I'll stand here and you stand over there.
All right, all right. How do you wear these things?
(sotto) Give it time.
Oh! Butterfingers!
Well, it's your fault. You're making me nervous.
Down, Zoe!
Are you all right, Zoe?
Yes. Yes, it's returning to its basic form.
Yes, we must get out of here. Look, Zoe. The machine is melting. Come on, let's get out of here before we're trapped.
Yes.
Yes, well, I'm a little bit shaken, but not half so bad as the Krotons, I can assure you. What're you doing here?
Well done!
Hmm? Well, the machine was eighty percent tellurium, Zoe, and tellurium is soluble in sulphuric acid.
No, well, the acid wasn't pure sulphuric acid, but it worked didn't it? Come along. Let's get away. I don't like goodbyes.

Ah! Now, sorry. There you are. So, where were we? I was summoned, wasn't I? An Ood in the snow, calling to me. Well, I didn't exactly come straight here. Had a bit of fun, you know. Travelled about, did this and that. Got into trouble. You know me. It was brilliant. I saw the Phosphorous Carousel of the Great Magellan Gestadt, saved a planet from the Red Carnivorous Maw, named a galaxy Alison. Got married. That was a mistake. Good Queen Bess. And let me tell you, her nickname is no longer. Ahem. Anyway, what do you want?
The last time I was here you said my song would be ending soon, and I'm in no hurry for that.
Hold on. Better lock the Tardis.
See? Like a car. I locked it like a car. Like. It's funny. No? Little bit? Blimey, try to make an Ood laugh. So how old are you now, Ood Sigma? Ah.
Magnificent. Oh, come on, that is splendid. You've achieved all this in how long?
Then we've got a problem. Because all of this is way too fast. Not just the city, I mean your ability to call me. Reaching all the way back to the twenty first century. Something's accelerating your species way beyond normal.
Why, what's happened?
So. Right. Hallo.
That man is dead.
Wilfred. Is he all right?
What about Donna, is she safe?
I don't know who they are.
The Master's wife.
She was. It wasn't her fault, she was. The Master, he's a Time Lord, like me. I can show you.
The Master took the name of Saxon. He married a human, a woman called Lucy. And he corrupted her. She stood at his side while he conquered the Earth. I reversed everything he'd done so it never even happened, but Lucy Saxon remembered. I held him in my arms. I burnt his body. The Master is dead.
What's that?
Part of him survived. I have to go!
What do you mean?
Please, let me help. You're burning up your own life force.
Out of my way!
Wilfred?
(sotto) Have you told them who I am? You promised me.
I'm really kind of busy, you know.
Is that your hand, Minnie?
What's so special about this place? We passed fifteen cafes on the way.
Who are you?
No. People have waited hundreds of years to find me and then you manage it in a few hours.
No, we keep on meeting, Wilf. Over and over again like something's still connecting us.
Exactly. Why you? I'm going to die.
Don't you dare.
But I was told. He will knock four times. That was the prophecy. Knock four times, and then
I can still die. If I'm killed before regeneration, then I'm dead. Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away, and I'm dead. What?
Stop it.
If she ever remembers me, her mind will burn, and she will die.
She's not changed.
Another wedding.
Hold on, she's not going to be called Noble-Temple? That sounds like a tourist spot.
Right. Is she happy? Is he nice?
She's got him.
Aren't we all?
No one. Travelling alone. I thought it was better. But I did some things. It went wrong. I need
Merry Christmas.
Look at us.
All that eloquence. But how many people have you killed?
Your resurrection went wrong. That energy. Your body's ripped open. Now you're killing yourself.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it. What if I ask you for help? There's more at work tonight than you and me.
I've been told something is returning.
No, something more.
I was told the end of time.
I'm sorry.
I can't hear it.
But
I heard it. But there's no noise. There never has been. It's just your insanity. What is it? What's inside your head?
Don't!
Let him go!
I lost him. I was unconscious. He's still on Earth, I can smell him, but he's too far away.
You're the only one, Wilf. The only connection I can think of. You're involved, if I could work out how. Tell me, have you seen anything? I don't know. Anything strange, anything odd?
What? What is it? Tell me.
Think-a think-a think. Maybe something out of the blue. Something connected to your life. Something.
What book?
That's the man. I was shown him by the Ood.
By the Ood.
They're just the Ood. But it's all part of the convergence. Maybe? It may be touching Donna's subconscious. Oh, she's still fighting for us, even now. The Doctor Donna.
Merry Christmas.
I'm going.
You can't come with me.
Fair enough.
Naismith. If I can track him down. Ah. Right. Yes. Bigger on the inside. Do you like it?
Cleaner? I could take you back home right now.
I cant go back inside my own timeline. I have to stay relative to the Master within the causal nexus. Understand?
Welcome aboard.
You should stay here.
And don't swear. Hold on.
Just a second out of sync. Don't want the Master finding the Tardis. That's the last thing we need.
Down here.
Nice Gate.
Don't try calling security, or I'll tell them you're wearing a Shimmer. Because I reckon anyone wearing a Shimmer doesn't want the Shimmer to be noticed, or they wouldn't need a Shimmer in the first place.
Shimmer.
He's got it working, but what is it? What's working?
Shimmer!
Now, tell me quickly, what's going on? The Master, Harold Saxon, Skeletor, whatever you're calling him, what's he doing up there?
Who are you, though? I met someone like you. He was brilliant, but he was little and red.
But what does it do?
No, there's got to be more. Every single warning says the Master's going to do something colossal.
Oh, good question. Why's it so big?
It does what?
Turn the Gate off right now!
No, no, no, no, no. Whatever you do, just don't let him near that device.
Deactivate it. All of you, turn the whole thing off!
Get out of there!
What is it? What can you see?
I can't turn it off.
Wilfred! Get inside. Get him out.
Just need to filter the levels.
Radiation shielding. Now press the button. Let me out.
I can't get out until you press the button. That button there.
To what?
What is it, hypnotism? Mind control. You're grafting your thoughts inside them, is that it?
You can't have.

And for my next trick.
Rose, get down! Get down, Rose!
I told you I'd come and get you.
I did. You all right?
Not bad, been better.
They went off to fight a bigger war. The Time War
I was there. The war between the Daleks and the Time Lords, with the whole of creation at stake. My people were destroyed, but they took the Daleks with them. I almost thought it was worth it. Now it turns out they died for nothing.
No good stood round here chin wagging. Human race, you'd gossip all day. The Daleks have got the answers. Let's go and meet the neighbours.
Is that it? Useless! Nul points. It's all right, come on out. That forcefield can hold back anything.
Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them that. Thanks.
Do you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the Dalek Homeworld? The Oncoming Storm. You might've removed all your emotions but I reckon right down deep in your DNA, there's one little spark left, and that's fear. Doesn't it just burn when you face me? So tell me. How did you survive the Time War?
Rose, Captain, this is the Emperor of the Daleks.
I get it.
I think you're forgetting something. I'm the Doctor, and if there's one thing I can do, it's talk. I've got five billion languages, and you haven't got one way of stopping me. So if anybody's going to shut up, it's you! Okey doke. So, where were we?
So you created an army of Daleks out of the dead.
Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy?
They're insane. Hiding in silence for hundreds of years, that's enough to drive anyone mad. But it's worse than that. Driven mad by your own flesh. The stink of humanity. You hate your own existence. And that makes them more deadly than ever. We're going.
Turn everything up. All transmitters full power, wide open. Now! Do it!
Stops the Daleks from transmatting on board. How did you get on? Did you contact Earth?
And the planet's just sitting there, defenceless. Lynda, what're you still doing on board? I told you to evacuate everyone.
Dalek plan. Big mistake, because what have they left me with? Anyone? Anyone? Oh, come on, it's obvious. A great big transmitter. This station. If I can change the signal, fold it back, sequence it, anyone?
Give the man a medal.
A Delta Wave!
And this place can transmit a massive wave. Wipe out the Daleks!
Trouble is, wave this size, building this big, brain as clever as mine, should take about, oh, three days? How long till the Fleet arrive?
Rose, you can help me. I need all these wires stripping bare.
Me too.
What?
You said suppose.
As soon as the Tardis lands in that second, I become part of events, stuck in the timeline.
There's another thing the Tardis could do. It could take us away. We could leave. Let history take its course. We go to Marbella in 1989.
No, but you could ask. Never even occurred to you, did it?
The Delta Wave's started building. How long does it need?
Rose Tyler, you're a genius! We can do it. If I use the Tardis to cross my old timeline. Yes!
Hold that down and keep position.
Cancels the buffers. If I'm very clever and I'm more than clever, I'm brilliant, I might just save the world. Or rip it apart
Me too. Now, I've just got to go and power up the Game Station. Hold on!
This is Emergency Programme One. Rose, now listen, this is important. If this message is activated, then it can only mean one thing. We must be in danger. And I mean fatal. I'm dead or about to die any second with no chance of escape.
And that's okay. Hope it's a good death. But I promised to look after you, and that's what I'm doing. The Tardis is taking you home.
And I bet you're fussing and moaning now. Typical. But hold on and just listen a bit more. The Tardis can never return for me. Emergency Programme One means I'm facing an enemy that should never get their hands on this machine. So this is what you should do. Let the Tardis die. Just let this old box gather dust. No one can open it. No one'll even notice it. Let it become a strange little thing standing on a street corner. And over the years, the world'll move on and the box will be buried. And if you want to remember me, then you can do one thing. That's all, one thing. Have a good life. Do that for me, Rose. Have a fantastic life.
She's not here.
She's not coming back.
Just get on with your work.
Yeah.
There are colonies out there. The Human Race would survive in some shape or form, but you're the only Daleks in existence. The whole Universe is in danger
If I let you live.
Do you see, Jack? That's the decision I've got to make for every living thing. Die as a human or live as a Dalek. What would you do?
Now, you tell me, God of all Daleks, because there's one thing I never worked out. The words Bad Wolf, spread across time and space, everywhere, drawing me in. How'd you manage that?
Oh, come on, there's no secrets now, your worship.
Jack
How're we doing?
Lynda! What's happening on Earth?
You'll be all right, Lynda. That side of the station's reinforced against meteors.
It's ready!
You really want to think about this, because if I activate the signal, every living creature dies.
Do you want to put that to the test?
I'll do it!
Coward. Any day.
And what about me? Am I becoming one of your angels?
Maybe it's time.
What've you done?
You looked into the Time Vortex. Rose, no one's meant to see that.
Rose, you've got to stop this. You've got to stop this now. You've got the entire vortex running through your head. You're going to burn.
Rose, you've done it. Now stop. Just let go.
But this is wrong! You can't control life and death.
The power's going to kill you and it's my fault.
That's what I see. All the time. And doesn't it drive you mad?
Come here.
I think you need a Doctor.
Don't you remember?
That's right. I sang a song and the Daleks ran away.
Rose Tyler. I was going take you to so many places. Barcelona. Not the city Barcelona, the planet Barcelona. You'd love it. Fantastic place. They've got dogs with no noses. Imagine how many times a day you end up telling that joke, and it's still funny.
Maybe you will, and maybe I will. But not like this.
I might never make sense again. I might have two heads, or no head. Imagine me with no head. And don't say that's an improvement. But it's a bit dodgy, this process. You never know what you're going to end up with
Stay away!
I absorbed all the energy of the Time Vortex, and no one's meant to do that. Every cell in my body's dying.
Yeah, I'm doing it now. Time Lords have this little trick, it's sort of a way of cheating death. Except it means I'm going to change, and I'm not going to see you again. Not like this. Not with this daft old face. And before I go
Rose, before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I.
Hello. Okay. Ooo, new teeth. That's weird. So, where was I? Oh, that's right. Barcelona.

Oh, lights. Oh, thats better. Ah, good! Well now, we seem to have materialised much quicker than I thought.
Well, I should hope so, dear boy. I should hope so.
Well, upon my soul, yes. Yes. Now isnt that extraordinary? Yes, we were wearing those cloaks and things, werent we? Well, I must say, its going to save us a lot of bother changing. Yes. Now, lets see where we are, shall we?
My dear boy, its over and done with. Now lets forget it. See where we are. Come along, pay attention.
I expect, child, theyre hanging up where theyre supposed to be. If youre that much concerned, go and have a look.
And on your way back, bring me glass of water please, Im very parched.
Oh, dear, dear, dear. Now where were we? All this fussation about a change of clothes. You know, its so simple. Its time and relativity, my dear boy. Time and relativity. Thats where the answer lies.
Yes, yes, I know. Well, at the moment there isnt time. Now, just pay attention, will you? (Looking up at the scanner.) Whats this?
Good, good! There you are, you see? Yes, you see?
Well, the scanners functioning. Looks like desert to me.
No, I dont think so, my boy, no. No, all those things up there come from a different period.
Well, Im afraid I cant give you any answers here, my dear.
Yes, I dont see why not. After all, the readings say its quite safe.
Oh, thank you, my dear. Thank you. So you dropped a glass, did you?
Well, dont look so concerned, child. Its quite easily replaced.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, we believe you, child. Yes, we believe you.
Well, look! Look! You see where weve landed? On a museum.
Precisely. If you take a closer look at those objects, youll see that some of them are more advanced in design. Its quite a natural progression.
Yes, we shall find that out. And Im sure you will agree with me, there are several things that we would like an answer to. So I suggest we go outside and take a look for ourselves, hmm?
Well, isnt that extraordinary? Ive never seen erosion in such an advanced stage. The whole planet appears to be completely dead.
Non-existent, extinct.
Well, I must say, the atmospheres quite pleasant.
Yes, I think we shall just have to go and search for the answers, and as theres always the element of danger in the unknown, I suggest we keep closer together. Is that clear?
Vicki?
Good, good. Now Ill take the lead and lets try and find those buildings we saw on the scanner.
Oh, what is it now, dear boy?
Yes, yes, so it appears, hmm.
Yes, thats curious, isnt it? Yes, very curious.
Well, we certainly havent met anyone yet.
How are we going to get in there?
My dear Barbara, if youve seen something or somebody, theres no sense in talking in riddles, is there?
Oh, thats quite enough. Now stop it. You'll have us all imagining things. There must be an explanation of this little
Hide quickly!
Up against the wall. Quick!
Its extremely doubtful that they were both deaf. However, the fact is, they didnt hear. Now, lets see whats in here.
No, I think theres probably something in the atmosphere that, er, has a very slow destructive property, er, hence the lack of windows.
Oh, I think that might just be some florescent substance in the walls. Yes, well, I think you two must admit that my assumption as to where we were, has been proved correct.
Well, you just pretend there are, young lady, and keep your hands to yourself.
Well why not? Why shouldnt it be? Its quite natural. After all, you have objects of historical interest on Earth, so why not a museum in space? I always thought Id find one someday.
Well, I suppose the answer's here somewhere. Thats what weve got to find out. Lets go and have a look in that other room.
Chesterton!
Dont touch, child.
I dont mind admitting, my boy, that that thing gave me a start. Coming face to face to it again.
Back. Get behind the case. Quick. Quick. Quick. Dont touch it.
Undoubtedly.
Well, I dont know. Chesterton might have had the answer in what he just said but, er, I doubt it, I doubt it. Come on. Come on.
Child, dont make so much noise. Whats the matter?
I thought I told you not to touch. When are you going to learn to obey me? How you
Upset? Upset? Whatever for? Why are you upset child? Whats the matter?
Incredible.
Thats strange. Strange indeed. You know, there must be a logical explanation for this somewhere? You know, I think its just a matter of putting two and two together to make three. You know there is
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Stand exactly where we are.
Ive never known anything in my life. In all my years of time travelling, I
Utterly unbelievable.
Yes, so strange. And yet we have no communication with them.
Does it, my boy? Does it? Either that or were not really here.
I have no idea, my child, but until I say otherwise, we continue the search. Now, let us see whats in here, hmm?
Good gracious me!
Oh? Youve all decided, have you?
Yes, Im afraid its going to be a little more difficult than that. The mists are beginning to clear slightly. Im just beginning to see reason. Where are we? Where are we?
Are we? We must have arrived here in the Tardis sometime. Are we here? Look!
Yes, exhibits in a Space Museum.
So you know about it, child? We must have a little chat some time.
Yes, it does, my boy. And if were not there, we cant leave footprints, and break glasses, or touch things.
Oh yes, they can. Oh yes, they can see us where we really are. There.
Well, my dear, I suppose we got into it. There must be. You know, I dont mind admitting, Ive always found it extremely difficult to solve the fourth dimension. And here we are. Face to face with the fourth dimension. You know, I think the Tardis jumped a time track and ended up here in this fourth dimension. Its extraordinary. Its inexplicable. No, wait a minute, wait a minute. I think youre all going to be delighted. Im going to come up with the answer and its so simple. Yes, so simple.
All we have to do is to wait here until we arrive.
You see, my dear, before they actually put us in those glass cases, we must have arrived here sometime in the Tardis. These people saw us and thought we were worthy people to be put in their Space Museum. Then
But nothing has happened to us yet. What we are doing now is taking a glimpse into the future, or what might be or could be the future. All that leads up to it, is still yet to come.
And end up one day, my dear, like that? No, we must not. Weve got to stop it happening.
I don't know, my boy, I cant be certain. You see, Im quite unable to measure the time dimension that the Tardis jumped. But youll notice were all wearing the same clothes. So, it could be in a few moments, or a few seconds.
The cases will disappear and we shall all become visible.
Precisely. So you see we must succeed in stopping them making exhibits of us. Otherwise, well, there it is. Thats how were all going to end up.
Hmm?
Yes, my dear. And weve arrived.
Chesterton, this is no time to be playing cowboys and indians.
Is that so? We have a very serious problem on our hands, and what are you doing with this anyway? Put it back in there.
Yes, I think Barbaras quite right, my dear. If we walk out of here, it could change the future. Perhaps if we wait until were taken out, that might change the future. The point is, what are we going to do? Which is it to be?
It isnt a good point at all, my dear boy. The fact is the future, our future, whether we leave here in the Tardis or not.
Yes, it is.
Decide, my dear? Spinning a coin would be just as appropriate. Who would want to put us on show or display, I wonder.
Lost a button? Hmm, thats interesting. Yes, thats very interesting.
The least important things sometimes, my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries. Like steam, for instance, coming out of a kettle. Yes, I was with him at the time. Lets see now, yes, what was that fellow's name?
Yes, you know, losing a button could change the future. Its a pity, my dear boy, you didnt discover it was missing in the cases when we were standing there staring at each other.
Yes, I quite understand that. Well, I think we should leave the Museum, try and find the Tardis, and make sure that it doesnt end up in here. Are you all agreeable?
Come along, then. Come along.
All right, my boy. You lead the way.
The way we came in, of course.
Your memory is like a sieve, dear boy. We turned right and then left.
I beg to differ, You see, you must turn right before you turn left.
We were facing from there, down here, therefore
Yes, I suppose I must confess I am. Anyway, I suggest we take Vickis advice. We can always re-trace our steps. So, we go this way and turn right. Right.
Yes, I think Vickis quite correct. Yes, I have a distinct impression weve all been here before. Yes, of course. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know where we are now.
Er, er
Straight, straight ahead, my dear boy. Straight ahead, yes, and turn right.
No more talking please. I think were nearly there.
And remember, we can be seen by now.
Hmm? Yes, yes, all right, child.
(inside the Dalek.) I fooled them all! I am the master!
Curator of a Museum is a better title.
Really? Well, from my observation it seems to arouse very little interest.
Perhaps if you reduced the price of admission?
Decline and fall of the Roman empire. Oh yes, its happened before, yes. In many galaxies far beyond your reach.
Exploration.
Im charmed.
Why?
Well? No more questions?
If you take a look into your screen, perhaps you will find that out?
Just some old friends of mine.
Oh, Im not, am I?
Dont blame your men. I think my friends most probably left the area long before you put questions to me. I imagined them still there, of course, because that was the last place I saw them. So you see, your little toy isnt infallible, is it?
Ahh!
(waking and groaning) Support me, dear boy. Support me over there and sit me down.
I shall be all right in a minute. Its a bad attack of rheumatism. Yes, it always happens to me when Im cold.
Yes, unfortunately, Im not used to being subjected to such low temperatures.
Its all right, dear boy. Its not, its not the circulation freeze.
Yes, dont fuss. Now dont do that.
My dear Governor, my dear Lobos, I dont think your soldiers have really got their heart in their job, have they? Thank you for getting me out of this little predicament. Although, I would have been better pleased had you done it more voluntary.
Yes. I know, I know.
Dead? Not at all, my boy. Not at all. I was merely, let me say, frozen stiff?
Exactly! My brain was working with the speed of a mechanical computer. I was asking myself questions and the answers were arriving with remarkable alacrity. Yes, yes. I must confess, I didnt enjoy the refrigeration, hence this attack of rheumatism. But thanks to you, my dear boy, I am now de-iced and I think Im quite capable of facing up to the climate once more.
The best thing for you, Governor Lobos, is to put you in there. Then you will have all the proof you needed. But you think yourself lucky. My conscience wont allow me to do that. Its a pity, isnt it? Its a pity!
Im not so sure of that, my dear boy. Where did you say youd left them?
And the Tardis?
Hmm. I see, I see.
Yes, and Im not sure of that either, Chesterton. Have we? Have we? Or are we doing what were allegedly intended to do? Now, what do you think?
Yes, thats true.
Thats true, but Im sure the Governor here would be delighted if we were both put back in there.
Am I correct, sir?
Chesterton, Chesterton. Save your strength. Itll take much more than that to get us out of this situation.
Well, my boy, youd hardly call me a pessimist, but I think its most unlikely that that is the only contraption of its kind.
Yes, I think I would have done the same thing.
Yes, and perhaps I shouldnt have got myself captured.
Yes, Vickis quite right. Quite right.
Well, its not necessarily, my boy.
My dear Barbara, you must try and remember, the short time weve been on this planet, weve met people, spoken to them and who knows, we might have even influenced them.
Yes, I knew you were, child, yes. Yes, I knew you were.
Quite so, yes, quite so, my boy.
The future doesnt look too bad after all, does it?
Well, there you both are. Thats it. Thats the little thing thats been giving us all this dimensional trouble.
You know, its a funny thing how it happened. It got stuck. I dont know whether youve gone into a room and switched on the light and had to wait for a second or two before the thing lit itself up.
Well, this is the same kind of problem, you see. We landed on a separate time track, wandered around a bit, and until this little thing clicked itself into place, we hadnt actually arrived.
Not at all, my dear boy, anytime, anytime.
Yes, please, yes. I wonder if youd mind taking it in for me. Inside the ship. Thank you. I just want to fetch Vicki.
There, now.
Yes, I think I can quite understand your sentiments, young man. But you know, you mustnt lose sight of science altogether. You might need it.
Ah, that my boy, yes. Well that I got from the Space Museum. This young man here, Tor, very kindly gave it to me as a souvenir.
My dear Chesterton, I dont think I have to ask your permission for what I take in my ship, and another thing, I will not have
Yes, well, as a matter of fact, my dear, its what they call a Time and Space Visualiser. You know, I couldnt believe my eyes when I saw it in the Space Museum. And I have an idea I can get it working again.
You will see, you will see. All in good time. Now then, have you said your goodbyes?
Splendid, splendid. Well now, I think we must get moving. Goodbye, young man.
Goodbye, Tor. Come along, my child. Come along.

Amy? Winston Churchill.
Oh, Winston, my old friend.
Ah, every time.
Tardis key, of course.
Ah, doesn't work like that.
I'd like to see you try.
You rang?
Yeah, well, had a bit of work done.
Yep. Top secret heart of the War Office, right under London.
Late?
Really? Sorry, sorry. It's a Type Forty Tardis, it's. I'm just running her in.
Why?
Such as?
History.
That wasn't human. That was never human technology. That sounded like. Show me. Show me. Show me what that was!
What are you doing here?
What?
Stop this. Stop now. Now, you know who I am. You always know.
Your what?
They're Daleks. They're called Daleks.
Invented them? Oh, no, no, no.
Shush. He didn't invent them. They're alien.
And totally hostile.
Why won't you listen to me? Why did you call me in if you won't listen to me?
Yes. Right. So destroy them. Exterminate them.
I am imagining.
Amy, tell him.
About the Daleks.
Everything. They invaded your world, remember? Planets in the sky. You don't forget that. Amy, tell me you remember the Daleks.
That's not possible.
So, they're up to something. But what is it? What are they after?
Amy. Amelia!
Winston. Winston, please.
Wait till the Daleks get started.
Yeah. Try the Earth in flames.
You're resisting, Winston. The whole world knows you're resisting. You're a beacon of hope.
Shut it. Listen to me. Just listen. The Daleks have no conscience, no mercy, no pity. They are my oldest and deadliest enemy. You cannot trust them.
What does hate look like, Amy?
It looks like a Dalek. And I'm going to prove it.
All right, Prof. Now, the PM's been filling me in. Amazing things, these Ironsides of yours. Amazing. You must be very proud of them.
How did you do it? Come up with the idea?
But you get a lot of these clever notions, do you?
And are these your ideas or theirs?
I don't know what you're up to, Professor, but whatever they've promised, you cannot trust them. Call them what you like, the Daleks are death.
Yes, Winston, and death to everyone else too.
Stop this! What are you doing here? What do you want?
To do what?
Really? Which war?
This war, against the Nazis, or your war? The war against the rest of the Universe? The war against all life forms that are not Dalek?
Oh, yeah? Okay. Okay, soldier, defend yourself.
Come on. Fight back. You want to, don't you? You know you do.
What are you waiting for? Look, you hate me. You want to kill me. Well, go on. Kill me. Kill me!
You are my enemy! And I am yours. You are everything I despise. The worst thing in all creation. I've defeated you time and time again. I've defeated you. I sent you back into the Void. I saved the whole of reality from you. I am the Doctor. And you are the Daleks.
I am the Doctor. And you are the Daleks.
Testimony. What are you talking about, testimony?
Transmit what, where?
I am the Doctor. And you are the Daleks.
Get back, all of you.
I wanted to know what they wanted. What their plan was. I was their plan.
Testimony accepted. That's what they said. My testimony.
This is what I do. yeah, and it's dangerous, so you wait here.
Safe as it gets around me.
Come on. Bingo!
How about that cuppa now, then?
Wait, wait, wait. I wouldn't if I were you. Tardis self-destruct, and you know what that means. My ship goes, you all go with it.
Try me.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. No scans. No nothing. One move and I'll destroy us all, you got that? Tardis bang bang, Daleks boom! Good boy. This ship's pretty beaten up. Running on empty, I'd say, like you. When we last met, you were at the end of your rope. Finished.
And you fell back through time, yes. Crippled, dying.
Progenitor? What's that when it's at home?
Oh? That's deep. That is deep for a Dalek. What does it mean, though?
Okay, but there's still one thing I don't get, though. If you've got the Progenitor, why build Bracewell?
But why? I get it. Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh ho! This is rich. The Progenitor wouldn't recognise you, would it? It saw you as impure. Your DNA is unrecognisable as Dalek.
Yes, yes, yes. Me. My testimony. So you set a trap. You knew that the Progenitor would recognise me, the Daleks' greatest enemy. It would accept my word. My recognition of you. No. No, no. What are you doing?
Who are you kidding? This ship is a wreck. You don't have the power to destroy London.
Turn those lights off now. Turn London off or I swear I will use the Tardis self destruct.
Oh, that's it. That's your great victory? You leave?
No, no, no. I won't let you get away this time. I won't.
Blimey. What do you do to the ones who mess up?
Don't mess with me, sweetheart.
Which would be you, I'm guessing. Well, you know, nice paint job.
I'd be feeling pretty swish if I looked like you. Pretty supreme.
Question is, what do we do now? Either you turn off your clever machine or I'll blow you and your new paradigm into eternity.
Occupational hazard.
All right, it's a Jammy Dodger, but I was promised tea.
I don't know.
Oh ho! Winston, you beauty.
Loud and clear, Danny Boy. Big dish, side of the ship. Blow it up. Over.
The Doctor to Danny Boy. The Doctor to Danny Boy.
I can disrupt the Dalek shields, but not for long. Over.
The Doctor to Danny Boy. The Doctor to Danny Boy. Destroy this ship. Over.
I'll be okay.
Ah ha. What, and let you scuttle off back to the future? No fear. This is the end for you. The final end.
I'm not stupid, mate. You've just played your last card.
You're bluffing. Deception's second nature to you. There isn't a sincere bone in your body. There isn't a bone in your body.
No. This is my best chance ever. The last of the Daleks. I can rid the Universe of you, once and for all.
Yeah, and if I let you go, you'll be stronger than ever. A new race of Daleks.
The Doctor to Danny Boy. The Doctor to Danny Boy. Withdraw.
Withdraw. Return to Earth. Over and out.
There's no time. You have to return to Earth now. Over.
Ow. Sorry, Professor, you're a bomb. An inconceivably massive Dalek bomb.
There's an Oblivion Continuum inside you. A captured wormhole that provides perpetual power. Detonate that, and the Earth will bleed through into another dimension. Now keep down.
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Never seen one up close before.
Oh no, not wired him up. He is a bomb. Walking, talking, pow, exploding, the moment that flashes red.
You're not helping.
Someone else's stolen thoughts, implanted in a positronic brain. Tell me about it. Bracewell. Tell me about your life.
Tell me, and prove you're human. Tell me everything.
And your parents? Come on, tell me.
What was that like? How did it feel? How did it make you feel, Edwin? Tell me. Tell me now.
Good. Remember it now, Edwin. The ash trees by the Post Office and your mum and dad, and losing them, and men in the trenches you saw die. Remember it. Feel it. You feel it because you're human. You're not like them. You're not like the Daleks.
Good. Good, good, brilliant. Embrace it. That means you're alive. They cannot explode that bomb because you're a human being. You are flesh and blood. They cannot explode that bomb. Believe it. You are Professor Edwin Bracewell, and you, my friend, are a human being.
It's not working. I can't stop it.
What was her name?
Dorabella? It's a lovely name. It's a beautiful name.
Welcome to the human race.
You're brilliant. (Bracewell) You're brilliant. (Amy) And you, I.
Now. Got to stop them. Stop the Daleks.
No. No! They can't. They can't have got away from me again.
I had a choice. And they knew I'd choose the Earth. The Daleks have won. They beat me. They've won.
No, it's not too shabby.
No.
Tying up loose ends. I've taken out all the alien tech Bracewell put in.
Exactly.
Oh, it doesn't work like that, Winston, and it's going to be tough. There are terrible days to come. The darkest days. But you can do it. You know you can.
The world doesn't need me.
The world's got Winston Spencer Churchill.
Too right.
Oh, shall we say adieu?
Moment?
Is it? Oh. Er, yeah.
No, you're dead right, Professor. A hundred percent right. And by the time I get back here in what, ten minutes?
Fifteen minutes, yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to do. You are going to be so de-activated. It's going be like you've never even been activated.
More like twenty, if I'm honest. Once Pond and I see to the urgent thing we've got to see to. The, the. See?
Easily. So no running off, that's what I'm saying. Don't go trying to find that little Post Office with the ash trees or that girl. What was her name?
Dorabella. On no account go looking for her. Mind you, you can get a lot done in half an hour.
Come along, Pond.
Everyone's got enemies.
Suppose so.
Yep. Very. Is that a problem?
I'm always worried about the Daleks.
It's not that. There's something else. Something we've forgotten. Or rather you have.
You didn't know them, Amy. You'd never seen them before. And you should have done. You should.

Improbable as it may seem, dear boy, I think the child, Dorothea
Oh yes, of course, my dear. Dodo is right.
Well, I can't tell you just yet. All I can say is that it's more likely to be Earth than anywhere else and it's very strange indeed. You know, I've been taking a look at my instruments in there and it's really very strange.
Well, it's just as I said. It's all very, very strange. That is an Indian elephant.
Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, dear boy.
Exactly, my dear.
Yes, you're quite right, my boy. Yes, and top of everything else, it's a jungle without a sky.
No sun, no clouds, merely a metal roof radiating some kind of light.
Yes, and plus something else.
The earth, this, this ground we're standing on. It appears to be trembling.
No, it's too regular for that. No, it's more of a mechanical vibration. Yes.
Extraordinary.
There's only one thing that strikes me. This could be some kind of indoor nature park.
Yes, yes, improbable dear boy, but possible. Definitely possible.
Mmm?
Oh, bless you my dear.
You have a handkerchief, I hope?
Well then, use it, my child! We must do something about that cold of yours. That reminds me, why are you dressed in these stupid clothes? Have you been footling about in my wardrobe? Is that what it is? What do you think you're playing at, crusades?
Yes, you do my dear. Now you take care of them because you never know when we might use them. Now, I suggest we take a last look round and we'll get you off to bed.
Home? Ho, ho! What an idea. I couldn't send you home even if I wanted to.
Ah, fab, hmm. My dear child, if you're going to be with us for any length of time, you'll have to do something about that English of yours.
It's terrible, child. Oh, it's most irritating. Well, look at that now. Isn't that extraordinary? Ah, very interesting. It looks like a zebra with two heads.
Hmm, perhaps and perhaps not. What then. Yes, we've already established this place as illogical. Why shouldn't there be animals with two heads?
Yes!
Yes, yes. What do they look like, dear boy?
Shh. You'll frighten the child. Come on.
Now, don't worry child. You're quite safe with us.
Now, let's try and get back to the Tardis. Take care. This might be dangerous.
Just do as he says, child. This may be very difficult.
Why, yes, of course. Yes! I know where I am now. Yes, indeed!
No, no, no, dear boy. All this is a spaceship!
Yes, exactly!
Oh, rubbish, rubbish. With all our imperfections, I can assure you, sir, if you were to cut my skin, I would bleed, the same as you would.
There you see, complete with chills.
A virus fever which used to be quite common to the human being.
Including the Daleks.
Segment? To use your phrase, sir, what segment are we in now?
Good gracious! We must have jumped at least ten million years.
Seven hundred years, but why travel that far? Surely
Yes, but where, sir? I can only see but a few people.
Oh yes, indeed!
Thank you.
Now tell me, that noise we heard just now. Was that a flight adjustment?
We may be able to help.
Do you realise what this means, dear boy?
All? All? These people, this generation, have never experienced the common cold for the simple reason it was wiped out many generations ago before they were born. They have no resistance to it.
I don't quite know, I don't know. But it might be fatal and we shall be to blame. Yes, it's all our fault and I should have foreseen it.
But I
Well, I'm not sure, dear boy. We shall just have to wait and see.
Well you did come, my dear, so it's too late to be worry about that. And stop snivelling!
But of course they care, my dear. Now don't worry. It's not your fault at all. If it's anybody's, it's mine.
Oh, I don't want to think it about it, dear boy. It's too horrifying. Though I must say that we're usually very healthy.
Well, that depends on the strength of the virus infection.
Oh, do blow your nose, child. It's running all over the place.
Well, look, my dear, do try and rest. You know you may be feeling better but you're far from cured. Oh, if only those wretched Guardians would let us out of here. I might be able to help.
I don't know.
Yes, my dear, and we are the accused.
Of course.
What?
Very well then, if only they'll listen.
My dear, I only want to help.
I hope so, my dear, I hope so.
Well, I'm afraid he may have. It appears that this virus is more virulent than I suspected.
Stop! I demand fair play. This young man is as ill as any one of your own people. How do you expect him to plead in his own defence?
Are you aware that you might be committing your entire community to a slow extinction? Trust me. Allow me, help me to find a new cure for this fever of yours.
At last we're near a solution. We must waste no more time. Now you two, get the boy up to the table.
Yes, cover him. We must keep him warm at once.
My dear young lady, please do as you're told. Now, where is that other young woman I want?
Oh good, now look here. Go to the Tardis and bring these things back for me, will you?
Yes, certainly, fine, fine.
Well open your eyes, my dear child, otherwise you won't be any use to me, will you?
What did you say?
Yes, I thought you did. Now once this crisis is over, I'm going to teach you to speak English.
Right, off you go.
Yes, I
Yes, now I want you to find all the sick people in this spaceship and give them the same treatment.
Exactly, my child. Yes.
Oh, and my child?
That also includes your father.
Now, this germ. This germ is
Yes, I know I'm a bit of a quack, but the combination of these two membrane fluids, a little at a time, should do the trick.
Ah, thank you, thank you. You know, you're far more knowledgeable than most people realise, aren't you?
Now, my dear Dodo, how is he?
Well, I don't see why not, yes. Now where is that sterilised postule?
Oh, thank you, thank you, yes. You know, I don't know what I would do without you.
Well, I don't see why not, my dear, providing I've mixed these properly.
Oh, don't let that cross our minds, for heavens sake. Now then, here we are.
What, with a hypodermic needle? Good gracious, no. That went out a long time ago. There we are. Now all we have to do is to wait and watch. Come along.
I'm going to treat the others precisely the same way as I've treated Steven.
Well it's going to be much dodgier my child, as you say, if I just sat and did nothing. Come along.
There now. Just relax and rest.
No, it's just a matter of time, my dear. Come along.
Yes, I think I've given him the right treatment.
Well, it's about an hour, my dear. He seems to be reacting quite normally. Yes, he's fighting it.
The fever's down and the temperature's dropped.
I mean he's going to be all right, my dear.
You have nothing further to worry about, sir. The sick have been tended to and the others immunised against further attack.
Oh, splendid, splendid.
Now, you can continue with the building of your statue and when it's finished, I'm sure it's going to look very beautiful.
Well, we must be off. Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, my dear.
Remember your journey is very important, young man, therefore you must travel with understanding as well as hope. Goodbye, Zentos.
You really must let me go first, child.
Oh. Well, that's strange. Something must have gone wrong. It appears we've landed back in the same place.
Take a look at this, my boy. Isn't it extraordinary? Well, now, that's inexplicable.
What is it, my dear? What have you found?
Well I'm not sure, dear boy. However, the statue's finished. That means seven hundred years must have passed since welast stood here.
Yes, I know, my dear. It's pretty hard for you to understand.
Yes, I think you're right.
I don't think that will be necessary, dear boy. It appears they've introduced some form of automatic guiding device.
Yes, well now, let's have a look at the scanner and see if that may help.
Yes, he's not the only one who's doing that.
Yes, it appears the Monoids have become overlords.
We are visitors to this spaceship. We were here many centuries ago. We come as friends.
To all whotravel in this spaceship.
Well, er, yes. But when we were here some time ago we also were friends of your forebears. They were called Monoids. Things were very different then.
I see, and the human beings?
Shush, child.
And what do you mean by that?
If I were to tell you, young man, you wouldn't believe me.
He'll probably die one unless we do something quickly about this situation.
Yes, we shall have to be pretty urgent too. Time is running out.
Let us return to the launcher and send a message back to the Ark. Tell them they can make their landings quite safely. I'm sure they'll be extremely delighted to hear it.
We were all wrong. This place is inhabited. Come, see for yourselves.
Shall we find out?
Strange. Strange indeed.
How can you be so sure?
Put that thing down! That is no way to establish friendship!
I think it comes from within this room.
(the weapon) You won't need that now.
And that was their aim, to land there and recreate life on this planet.
I see. Just to make us comfortable? I didn't think you needed places like this for yourselves.
But can you see each other?
Nothing, my dear. We shall just have to wait until the next party lands.
Well, in that case we shall just have to stay here.
Yes, yes, I can quite understand that. That is why you destroyed the Launcher?
Yes, that's true my dear but, you mustn't think they were perfect. Oh, no. Sometimes they were extremely intolerant and selfish.
Exactly.
Yes. One day. Thank you.
Quite so, my dear. Quite so.
Now.
This is Refusis contacting spaceship Ark.
Oh, thank heaven, Steven, my boy, you're safe. Now listen. The Ark is about to blow up!
No, I do not, but I'm going to find out from the Monoids. In the meantime, I'll send back some of the launchers to the Ark. Now, continue with the search!
Oh, I'm glad you heard that. You know, these launchers are simple to operate and I would like to suggest, my friend, that you fly them back to the Ark.
Yes, the Monoids won't know who's taking them. And as for me talking to them, or speaking to them, as you say, well, the problem's quite simple.
Thank you.
Ah, so we meet again. Welcome to Refusis.
Delighted, delighted.
Well, to tell the truth, neither have we.
I don't know. I haven't seen one.
Thank you. It's very kind of you.
What is more important, is the Ark still all right?
We have found the bomb. We must warn them immediately. Come along.
Splendid! Come along.
To the Launcher!
Now, you fly us back to the Ark. Meanwhile, I'll contact Steven.
He's right. A long time ago, your ancestors accepted responsibility for the welfare of these Monoids. They were treated like slaves. So no wonder when they got the chance, they repaid you in kind.
Yes, you must travel with understanding as well as hope. You know, I once said that to one of your ancestors, a long time ago. However, we must be going. Goodbye.
Good. That means the gravitational bearing must have rectified itself.
What do you mean, dear boy? I'm still here.
What? Oh, nonsense, child. Nonsense!
You're wrong! This is something far more serious. We're in grave danger. This is some form of attack!

Further than we've ever gone before.
It's the year five billion and twenty three. We're in the galaxy M87, and this? This is New Earth.
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Apple grass.
Yeah, yeah.
Me too. Come on.
So, the year five billion, the sun expands, the Earth gets roasted.
We had chips. So anyway, planet gone, all rocks and dust, but the human race lives on, spread out across the stars. Soon as the Earth burns up, oh yeah, they get all nostalgic, big revival movement, but then find this place. Same size as the Earth, same air, same orbit. Lovely. Call goes out, the humans move in.
New New York.
It is. It's the city of New New York. Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New New New New New New New New New New New New New New York. What?
New New Doctor.
Well, I thought we might go there first.
Some sort of hospital. Green moon on the side. That's the universal symbol for hospitals. I got this. A message on the psychic paper.
Someone wants to see me.
I can't help it. I don't like hospitals. They give me the creeps.
No shop. I like the little shop.
The human race moves on, but so do the viruses. It's an ongoing war.
Now, don't stare. Think what you look like to them, all pink and yellow. That's where I'd put the shop. Right there.
Ward 26, thanks!
Oh, too late. I'm going up.
Ward 26.
And watch out for the disinfectant.
The disinfectant!
The disin. Oh, you'll find out.
Nice place. No shop, downstairs. I'd have a shop. Not a big one. Just a shop, so people can shop.
A shop does some people the world of good. Not me. Other people.
That's Petrifold Regression, right?
I doubt it. Petrifold Regression? He's turning to stone. There won't be a cure for oh, a thousand years? He might be up and about, but only as a statue.
No, I think I've found him.
Oh, I think my friend got lost. Rose Tyler. Could you ask at reception?
We met just the once on Platform One. What's wrong with him?
Of what?
Oh, I don't know. I like impossible. I'm here. I look a bit different, but it's me, It's the Doctor.
You're the one working.
Am I the only visitor?
What does that mean?
Tell me the rest.
Rose, where are you?
Where've you been? How long does it take to get to Ward 26?
You'll never guess. I'm with the Face of Boe.
Remember him?
I'd better go. See you in a minute.
No, thanks. You had Petrifold Regression, right?
But that's impossible.
How on Earth did you cure him?
What's in that solution?
Then tell me what it is.
I'm the Doctor.
There you are. Come and look at this patient. Marconi's Disease. Should take years to recover. Two days. I've never seen anything like it. They've invented a cell washing cascade. It's amazing. Their medical science is way advanced. And this one.
Pallidome Pancrosis. Kills you in ten minutes, and he's fine. I need to find a terminal. I've got to see how they do this. Because if they've got the best medicine in the world, then why is it such a secret?
What's, what's. what's with the voice?
Well, I can talk. New New Doctor.
Yep, still got it.
Nope, nothing odd. Surgery, post-op, nano-dentistry. No sign of a shop. They should have a shop.
You're right. Well done.
What if the sub-frame's locked?
Yeah. Of course. Sorry. Hold on.
Intensive Care. Certainly looks intensive.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
All of them. Every single disease in the galaxy. They've been infected with everything.
The air's sterile. Just don't touch them.
They're not patients.
They were born sick. They're meant to be sick. They exist to be sick. Lab rats. No wonder the Sisters have got a cure for everything. They've built the ultimate research laboratory. A human farm.
Plague carriers. The last to go.
Novice Hame, When you took your vows, did you agree to this?
What, by killing?
What's the turnover, hmm? Thousand a day? Thousand the next? Thousand the next? How many thousands? For how many years? How many!
These people are alive.
If they live because of this, then life is worthless.
I'm the Doctor. And if you don't like it, if you want to take it to a higher authority, then there isn't one. It stops with me.
Hold on. I can understand the bodies. I can understand your vows. One thing I can't understand. What have you done to Rose?
And I'm being very, very calm. You want to be aware of that. Very, very calm. And the only reason I'm being so very, very calm is that the brain is a delicate thing. Whatever you've done to Rose's head, I want it reversed.
These people are dying, and Rose would care.
What's happened to you?
Who are you?
Cassandra?
Let me out! Let me out!
You've stolen Rose's body.
Just let Rose go, Cassandra.
What've you done?
Don't touch them! Whatever you do, don't touch!
What the hell have you done?
One touch and you get every disease in the world, and I want that body safe, Cassandra. We've got to go down.
Run! Down! Down! Go down!
Keep going! Go down!
No, the lifts have closed down. That's the quarantine. Nothing's moving.
Someone will touch him.
I'm sorry, I can't let her escape.
Well, for starters, you're going to leave that body. That psychograft is banned on every civilised planet. You're compressing Rose to death.
Not my problem. You can float as atoms in the air. Now, get out. Give her back to me.
Oh, my. This is different.
Goodness me, I'm a man. Yum. So many parts. And hardly used. Oh, oh, two hearts! Oh, baby, I'm beating out a samba!
Oo, he's slim, and a little bit foxy. You've thought so too. I've been inside your head. You've been looking. You like it.
What do we do? What would he do? The Doctor, what the hell would he do?
Out of the way, blondie!
Yap, yap, yap. God, it was tedious inside your head. Hormone city.
Go and play with a ball of string.
Now what do we do?
You mean this thing?
Well, I don't know how. That Doctor's hidden away all his thoughts.
Hold on tight.
Not till you get out of her.
I order you to leave her.
No matter how difficult the situation, there is no need to shout.
But I can't go into you, he simply refuses. He's so rude.
Oh, I am so going to regret this.
(to Rose) Nice to have you back.
That was your last warning, Cassandra!
We're safe! We're safe! We're safe! We're clean! We're clean! Look, look.
Look, clean. Look, if we'd been touched, we'd be dead. So how's it going up here? What's the status?
You can't do that. If they forced entry, they'd break quarantine.
We can't let a single particle of disease get out. There is ten million people in that city. They'd all be at risk. Now, turn that off!
All right, fine. So I have to stop you lot as well. Suits me. Rose, novice Hame, everyone! Excuse me, your Grace. Get me intravenous solutions for every single disease. Move it!
How's that? Will that do?
Not moving. Different thing. Here we go.
I'm going down! Come on!
I need another pair of hands. What do you think? If you're so desperate to stay alive, why don't you live a little?
Going down!
Now, listen. When I say so, take hold of that lever.
Hold that lever! I'm cooking up a cocktail. I know a bit about medicine myself.
Now, that lever's going to resist. But keep it in position. Hold onto it with everything you've got.
I've got an appointment. The Doctor is in.
I'm in here! Come on!
Pull that lever!
Come and get me. Come on!
I'm in here! Come on!
Hurry up! Come on!
Come on, come on.
All they want to do is pass it on. Pass it on!
Pass it on!
No. That's your way of doing things.
I'm the Doctor, and I cured them.
That's right. Hey, there we go, sweetheart. Go to him. Go on, that's it. That's it. It's a new sub-species, Cassandra. A brand new form of life. New humans! Look at them. Look! Grown by cats, kept in the dark, fed by tubes, but completely, completely alive. You can't deny them, because you helped create them. The human race just keeps on going, keeps on changing. Life will out! Ha!
The Face of Boe!
You were supposed to be dying.
Shh!
There are legends, you know, saying that you're millions of years old.
Wouldn't it just. I got the impression there was something you wanted to tell me.
So the legend says.
Oh, does it have to?
That is enigmatic. That, that is, that is textbook enigmatic. And now for you.
You've lived long enough. Leave that body and end it, Cassandra.
No one does.
I can't.
Don't you dare. He's got a life of his own.
You can't, Cassandra, you
Oh! You all right? Whoa! Okay?
Hello. Welcome back.
You can't stay in there. I'm sorry, Cassandra, but that's not fair. I can take you to the city. They can build you a skin tank and you can stand trial for what you've done.
Are you all right?
I can take you to the city.
Come on. There's one last thing I can do.
Just go. And don't look back.

Your clothing's a little anachronistic for this time period, and that doesn't help.
Strange.
You're not carrying any Nitro Nine explosives in there?
What do you make of that van?
No. Wrong type of aerial. For this time period, that's a very sophisticated piece of equipment.
Lack of food makes you obstreperous. Why don't you go and buy some consumables? There's a cafe down there. While I undertake a detailed and scientific examination of that van that has so singularly failed to grab your attention.
Ace!
Money.
She doesn't talk to strangers. Very wise.
The source of magnetic fluctuation, perhaps.
I thought so. Any possibility of natural phenomena?
So, it's artificial in origin.
Yes?
The Doctor.
How do you do? I'm sure I've heard of you.
Ace, get in here!
What's the situation?
I'm the Doctor and this is Ace. You must be with the military.
I'm very perceptive.
No evidence of tissue damage. Ah, massive internal displacement.
His insides were scrambled. Very nasty.
No. A projected energy weapon.
Very succinct. I presume you've got reinforcements coming?
What a predictable response.
Whatever fired that weapon's trapped in there. There's no way out.
I've been here before.
I don't think you realise what you're dealing with here.
Down!
That was your death ray.
Yes?
You must pull your men back now. It's their only chance.
Listen to me, Brigadier.
Nothing you possess will be effective against what's in there!
Captain, you're not dealing with human beings here.
No, Little green blobs in bonded-polycarbite armour.
Group Captain Gilmore.
Humans.
It doesn't matter how many men you get here. It isn't going to make any difference.
That's the point group, Group Captain, it isn't even remotely human.
Aim for the eyepiece! Ace, give me some of that Nitro Nine that you're not carrying. Quickly.
And another.
I should hope so, too. Er, how long, the fuse?
That's long enough.
Oi, Dalek! It's me, the Doctor. What's the matter? Don't you recognise your mortal enemy?
Three, four, five, six.
Ace, you said ten seconds.
Yes, of course I am. Can you drive?
Good, I thought so. Get in there.
A Dalek. Only trouble is, it's the wrong Dalek.
Yes. Choke.
Borrowing your van.
Daleks.
From Skaro. At least, originally. They're the mutated remains of a species called the Kaleds. Left here.
No. Turn left here.
No, left! You've missed the turning.
Why don't you concentrate on where you're going?
The Kaleds were at war with the Thals. They had a dirty nuclear war. The resulting mutations were then accelerated by their chief scientist, Davros. What he created them he then placed them in a metal war machine, and that's how the Daleks came about
Exactly. And ever since the Daleks were created, they've tried to conquer and enslave as much as the universe as they can get their grubby protuberances on.
Nothing so mundane. They conquer the Earth in the twenty second century. No. They want the Hand of Omega.
One thing at a time, Ace.
Good afternoon.
The Doctor. And you?
References?
Oh, no. We're here for a completely different reason.
Well, we would like to look round your school, if you don't mind?
We've got reason to believe there is a great evil at work somewhere in this school.
Thank you.
Yes, they're following me.
You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.
Come and look at this.
What do you make of that?
The burn marks. See them? Well?
Very good.
Do you remember the Zygon gambit with the Lock Ness Monster? Or the Yetis in the Underground?
Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched by only its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself .
When I was here before, I left something behind.
Yes.
Something very dangerous.
Shush. Whoever it was landed the spaceship in the playground.
More Daleks.
Ah, the cellar. It could be down in there.
Good place to put things, cellars.
So do I.
The unknown.
Probably. But then if I knew what was down here, I wouldn't have to look.
Yes. Very elegant, very advanced. Flux circuitry elements.
It's a transmat. A matter transmitter. But transmitting from where? Within about three hundred kilometres.
Very likely. It has an automatic activator. What? You're right. Something is beginning to come through.
Excellent.
I sincerely doubt that. If I can just get the transmitter to de-phase at the critical point.
Any moment now. Quick! Down!
Yes, the de-phase must have caused an overload.
Well, I persuaded one half of the Dalek to materialise where its other half was materialising. The two halves tried to co-exist at the same point. The resulting reaction destroyed it. Dangerous things, transmats.
Well, it'll slow them down a bit until the operator can repair the systems.
Yes, the Daleks usually leave an operator on station in case of any malfunctions.
Yes.
The stairs!
Ace! Ace! Open the door! Ace! Open
What's the matter with him?
School dinners. Give me a hand.
Ace!
What are you doing here? Oh, never mind. Get this thing out of here.
ATRs. Anti-tank rockets.
It's not the Daleks we're after, it's the transmat.
Come on.
Quite possibly. Stay close behind.
Ace, get down!
You destroyed it.
No.
It is not good. Nothing about this is good. I've made a grave error of judgment. Oh, I'm going to wish I'd never started all this. Group Captain, I must ask you to evacuate the immediate area.
I've reason to believe a major Dalek Task Force could soon be operating here.
One certainly is in place hidden somewhere in this vicinity. The other probably from a mothership in geostationary orbit.
Do you doubt the non-terrestrial nature of the Daleks? I mean, examine this one. Or better still, ask your Scientific Advisor.
Splendid.
I shouldn't touch it if I were you. It may not be completely dormant yet.
So have I. I'll return in the morning.
To bury the past.
It is not your past. You haven't been born yet. Would someone look after Ace for me?
I'll borrow this.
A mug of tea, please.
Yes, it is. Bitter, very bitter. Where's Harry?
Of course. It'll be twins.
Ah. A decision. Would it make any difference?
Yes, but beyond the confines of my tastebuds, would it make any difference?
But
What if I could control people's tastebuds? What if I decided that no one would take sugar? That'd make a difference to those who sell the sugar and those that cut the cane.
Exactly. Now, if no one had used sugar, your father wouldn't have been a cane cutter.
See? Every great decision creates ripples, like a huge boulder dropped in a lake. The ripples merge, rebound off the banks in unforeseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences.
Did you see that?
Nothing. What would you do if you had a decision, a big decision?
Saving the world.
Really.
Let's hope I make the right decision. Things could get unpleasant round here. I'd take a holiday if I were you.
Two or three days. After that, it won't matter one way or the other. Thanks for the tea.
Good morning. I believe this belongs to you.
The door was open so I thought I'd just pop in and collect my casket.
Yes, that would be perfectly all right.
Doctor.
Yes. Now, if I might be alone with the
Thank you.
Yes.
Hello. Open.
Now, let's see what you can make of this.
Come on, now. Give it up.
Goodbye. Close.
Follow me.
Thank you.
It's very good of you to do this at such short notice.
I had to leave suddenly.
Yes, it has changed. Several times.
Yes.
No. It's only just beginning.
Working, unlike some people.
Have a nice sleep?
I was not wandering the streets. I was merely contemplating certain local cartographic anomalies.
Ah, Ace, I have a present for you.
Higher technology, and no, I can't tell you how.
You're not ready for it. No one on this planet is.
I'll meet you outside.
Ace, I'm trying to convince Group Captain Gilmore to keep his men out of trouble, otherwise there'll be a lot of needless deaths.
Yes.
No.
Will you obey me this once? I'll explain everything when I return.
I haven't got the time!
Trust me.
Yes?
Or?
Group Captain, the evacuation?
With respect, Group Captain, your career's magnificently irrelevant. Now, let's see. Any more transmission sites?
Good. I want a direct line to Jodrell Bank. Let's see. 1963. The Fylingdale installations and the Royal Observatory. Order them to search these localities for any signs of high orbital activity.
Now, I want the detector vans moved so they can cover this area here and here. Order all air and ground forces to avoid engaging the enemy at all costs. We must act with extreme caution.
Goodbye civilisation as you know it.
Twenty six by zero zero one. A big mothership of some kind, with maybe as many as four hundred Daleks on board. Well, at least we know where it is.
That ship has weapons capable of cracking open this planet like an egg.
Good. Over here.
For one group, at least. I believe we're dealing with two antagonistic Dalek factions.
From another planet in a distant future. We must try and contain them, let them destroy each other.
Have you been listening to me, Group Captain? That spaceship up there has surveillance equipment capable of spotting a sparrow fall at fifteen thousand kilometres. Any sign of a military build-up and they may simply decide to sterilise the area.
Frightening, isn't it, to find there are others better versed in death than human beings.
Well, at best it will interfere with the Dalek's control systems. I rigged something like it on Spiridon.
It'll do absolutely nothing.
Where?
Mike, phone up Ace and tell her someone will come and collect her.
Multiple? They've got the transmat working again.
More Daleks.
Get a vehicle ready. Load it up with plastic explosives and integral detonators.
Well, that thing merely disorients and weakens them. What do you expect me to do then, talk to them sternly?
It works. It works!
There were living beings in there.
Yes, Sergeant.
Hmm?
Oh? Let's see, Professor.
Allison, it's dead. Thank you.
They've mutated again. Here, come and have a look. Compare that to the destroyed Dalek at Totter's Lane. Note the difference.
Sergeant Smith must have found some more Daleks.
You two go down and check the cellar, but don't touch anything. I'll look after Ace.
When I say stay put, I mean stay put, not take on an entire Dalek assault squad single-handed. What were you doing here, anyway?
Where is it?
Good.
That tape deck was a dangerous anachronism. If someone had found it and discovered the principles of its function, the whole microchip revolution would take place now, twenty years too early, with incalculable damage to the time line.
So? Ace, the Daleks have a mothership up there capable of eradicating this planet from space, but even they, ruthless though they are, would think twice before making such a radical alteration to the time line.
There, you ought to be able to get up and walk about now.
Lovely flowers, begonias.
It's a link for the Daleks, allowing them to beam death squads onto Earth without anybody knowing. And I don't want them here just yet.
Weapons. Always useless in the end. Oh, you look hungry. How about lunch?
Concentrating.
Group Captain, we need to establish a forward base at the school. Can it be done?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Well, now that I've disabled the transmat, absolutely nothing. As long as the renegade Daleks have got the Hand of Omega, then the Imperial Daleks' attention will be focused on that.
Yes.
Yes?
Keeping an eye on Group Captain Chunky Gilmore. Although why his men call him Chunky, I've no idea.
That's the general idea. I want to keep the military fully occupied and out of the way.
A long time ago, on my home planet of Gallifrey, there lived a stellar engineer called Omega.
Ace!
It was Omega who created the supernova that was the initial power source for Gallifreyan time travel experiments. He left behind him the basis on which Rassilon founded Time Lord society, and he left behind the Hand of Omega.
No, no, not his hand literally. No, no, it's called that because Time Lords have an infinite capacity for pretension.
The Hand of Omega is a mythical name for Omega's remote stellar manipulator, a device used to customise stars with. And didn't we have trouble with the prototype.
They.
Oh yes, Daleks have got time corridor technology, but it's very crude and nasty. What they want is the power that Time Lords have, and they'll get that with the Hand of Omega, or so they think.
No, Ace, I want them to have it.
My problem is trying to stop Group Captain Gilmore and his men getting diced in the crossfire.
A massive deception, yes.
Just one thing.
I didn't expect two Dalek factions, and now I've got to make sure the wrong ones don't get their grubby little protuberances on it.
No. Dalek hunting is a terminal pastime.
Dalek hunting.
This way.
The main staging area must be in that warehouse.
Might as well.
Daleks.
Be quiet.
The Hand of Omega's inside this box. The most powerful and sophisticated remote stellar control manipulator device ever constructed.
Absolutely. You know what you've got to do, don't you?
Yes, of course you do.
In a manner of speaking, yes.
Some kind of biomechanoid control system, for a small human. Of course, it's a battle computer!
The Dalek's major drawback is their dependency on rationality and logic. The solution? Get a human, preferably young, imaginative, plug the child into the system, and their ingenuity and creativity are slaved to the battle computer.
It's obscene. Ah, now for the time controller.
It's a device the renegade Daleks use to travel through time. They've come a long way.
No, no, no, I don't want to lumber Earth with a load of desperate Daleks. I've merely put it out of phase. They'll be able to fix it, but it'll slow them down.
With a bit of luck, the Imperial Daleks will wipe out the renegade faction. Besides, I can't just roll up and give it to them. They get suspicious.
Shush!
Yes?
No, no, no, we've got work to do. Anyway, here come the military.
Dalek hunting. Now it's the other way around. Is Gilmore back at the school?
Good. We'll go back and smooth his troubled brow.
Moderately so. I'm afraid we've brought back some Daleks with us.
How did you know that, Sergeant?
It can wait.
On a re-entry curve from low orbit?
That'll be the Imperial Dalek shuttlecraft.
Here? No. We're much too far from the main action.
Ace, get away from the window! Down!
I think I might have miscalculated.
No, that's a shuttle. The mothership's much larger. Are you willing to cooperate with me now?
Well, you could go down there and make a gloriously futile gesture, yes.
A little bit of piracy.
Elementary piracy, my dear Allison. Dalek shuttles have massive ground defences and an unguarded service hatch on top. Now once I'm down there, I'll attempt to open that hatch. Ace, you come after, then Gilmore, followed by Allison and Rachel. Any questions? No? Good.
I'm not human.
Yes.
Correct.
Goodbye.
You can come down now!
I shorted it out. Daleks are such boring conversationalists.
Yes, they're not known for their aesthetic sense. Let's see what they were up to.
Ah, the planet Skaro. So, the Daleks are returning to their ancestral seat. I think we've seen enough. Time to leave. Er, get off the grill.
We'll go back through the playground.
Oh, I've turned those off. Come on, jump.
I rigged the communications relay to the shuttle control system. We can monitor the Daleks on the transmat in the cellar.
I can do anything I like!
He'll be fine. Rachel and Allison, I need your help.
Ah, you brought it then. Put it down there.
Yes?
Ace.
Blobs?
Result?
Well, er, Ace, let's go and see which blobs are winning.
Do what?
It's easy when you have nine hundred years experience.
He's got the time controller. Typical human. You can always count on them to mess things up. Get after him. Stay with him. See where he's going.
Oh, Ace.
No heroics. I've got enough problems already.
Provided everything goes according to my plan.
It's a surprise.
How do I look? Don't answer. Do you mind? You're in my shot.
Hello, hello, hello? Dalek mothership, come in please. Come in, please.
Ah, there you are. This is the Doctor, President Elect of the High Council of Time Lords, Keeper of the legacy of Rassilon, Defender of the Laws of Time, Protector of Gallifrey. I call upon you to surrender the Hand of Omega and return to your customary time and place.
Davros. I should have known. I see you've discarded the last vestige of your human form. Still no improvement.
Will you return the Hand of Omega or not?
Every time our paths have crossed, I have defeated you.
Oh, Davros, I am far more than just another Time Lord.
Davros, the Hand of Omega is not to be trifled with.
I sincerely doubt that.
Powerful. Crush the lesser races. Conquer the galaxy. Unimaginable power. Unlimited rice pudding, et cetera, et cetera.
Oh, wonderful. What power, what brilliance. You can wipe out the odd civilisation, enslave the occasional culture, but it still won't detract from the basic fundamental truth of your own impotence!
(covers the microphone) Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
Davros, I beg of you, don't use the Hand.
You're making a grave mistake.
No, Davros. You tricked yourself.
Do you think I would let you have control of the Hand of Omega?
Nothing can stop it now.
I have pity for you.
Goodbye, Davros. It hasn't been pleasant.
I programmed the Hand of Omega to fly into Skaro's sun and turn it supernova.
The resulting explosion destroyed Skaro, and the feedback destroyed the mothership. The Hand of Omega is now returning to Gallifrey.
Not this time. I started this.
Dalek, you have been defeated. Surrender. You have failed.
Your forces are destroyed. Your home planet a burnt cinder circling a dead sun.
Even Davros, your creator, is dead.
You have no superiors, no inferiors, no reinforcement, no hope, no rescue.
You're trapped a trillion miles and a thousand years from a disintegrated home.
I have defeated you. You no longer serve any purpose.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Time to leave.
Yes?
Perhaps. Time will tell. It always does.

Genius.
Get out.
Get out!
Admit it. You've all had this exact nightmare.
So,anyone for dodgems?
Of course, the
Proposition. Davros is an insane, paranoid genius who has survived among several billion trigger-happy mini-tanks for centuries. Conclusion? I'm definitely having his chair.
I'm guessing his personal forcefield only works in one direction.
Doesn't he? Ah, listen to your little hearts beat!
Ask me what I want.
I've been at the heart of your empire for forty two minutes, and I own it, and I haven't even got out of my chair. Ask me what I want.
Clara Oswald.
I want Clara Oswald, safe, alive, and returned to me immediately. You bring her back. You do that. You do that now. Unharmed. Unhurt. Alive.
I saw what happened. I was there. And I'm hoping, for all of our sakes, that it was a trick.
Because if Clara Oswald is really dead, then you'd better be very, very careful how you tell me.
Who's going to tell me?
Who's going to go first?
All the power Davros had is mine.
Everything he had, I have.
Who's going to tell me that Clara Oswald is really dead?
Davros. You're up. Sorry, this seat's taken.
You neither.
I gave it up. Bad memories.
You keep saying that, you keep not dying. Can you give it some welly? Come on.
We have no business.
They don't have much respect for you, do they? Your kids. Have you seen the state of this place? I mean, this is exactly where you dump a smelly old uncle slash family pet slash genius scientist who couldn't even invent legs. Seriously, how do your boys take it when everybody else has got two eyes?
Oh, yes. It's a hyperspace relay, with some kind of a genetic component.
Ooo. Nice. Vampiring off your own creations, just to eke out your days. I'm surprised the Daleks allow it.
What defect?
Er, why would you be telling me this?
There's no such thing as the Doctor. I'm just a bloke in a box, telling stories. And I didn't come here because I'm ashamed. A bit of shame never hurt anyone. I came because you're sick and you asked. And because sometimes, on a good day, if I try very hard, I'm not some old Time Lord who ran away. I'm the Doctor.
Always.
I hope so.
I wouldn't die of anything else.
Yeah, well, if you're going to put your hand on my knee, it isn't going to go well.
Well, because I did.
It's a boring place, Gallifrey. I was going out of my mind.
Ah, well, I'm inconsistent.
What lie?
I do.
Don't you dare!
Some things matter to me, Davros. Not many, but a few. And you don't put your fingers anywhere near them.
And they'd better not be scratched. These are my best ones.
Well, by now that should make you nervous.
How long has it been, you and I?
And now you ask me a personal question?
My people are alive. They didn't die. I brought them back. I found a way.
Gallifrey is back in the sky. I don't know where, I may never know. But Gallifrey is back and it is safe from both of us.
I'm sorry?
Why are you saying that?
I don't, I don't understand this. Why are you
You've seen it often enough.
You really are dying, aren't you?
Yes.
What?
How did you get it back?
No, like you. Everything you are, they are.
I'm trying to pep this up, but you've been going a long time. Every Dalek on Skaro isn't enough any more.
I'm not helping you. I'm helping a little boy I abandoned on a battlefield. I think I owe him a sunrise.
Come on, chin up.
Any minute now
Here it comes.
Look, the sun's coming up. We're on the same side now.
Okay, don't ever tell anyone that I did this.
A little bit of regeneration energy. Probably cost me an arm or a leg somewhere down the line. Or I'll just be really little.
Should be enough, just to
What are you doing?
No! No! No, please! No!
Please you must, you must stop this. You must stop this!
Stop!
Where's Clara?
You're alive, so she is too. Where is she?
Three.
Two.
One.
I knew exactly what you were doing, and I let you do it. You transmitted regeneration energy into every Dalek on this planet. Every single one.
One word. Er, no, two words, actually. First word, moron.
Second word, sewers.
Generations of Daleks just woke up very cross, and they are coming up the pipes. Or to put it another way, bye!
This city is about to be sucked into the ground. Your own sewer is about to consume you. There's no way you can win, there is nothing you can do, so just tell me, where is Clara Oswald?
Yes, you're a Dalek. Where is Clara?
Yes, I know that you're a Dalek. Where is Clara Oswald?
Is Clara dead?
You shouldn't be able to say that.
That word shouldn't exist in your vocabulary. How did Davros teach you to say that?
Why aren't you trying to kill me?
I'm putting the gun down. Open your casing.
Just think the word "open". It'll work.
Missy, run.
I'm sorry, Clara. I'm so sorry!
I said, run.
Where was the Tardis? It was over there somewhere, wasn't it?
Dalek Supreme, your sewers are revolting.
Oh, well, go on, then. Exterminate away.
Oops, sorry. Tardis force field is still here. We get in, you don't.
Ah, don't be silly, of course it hasn't. It just redistributed itself for a moment. Hostile Action Dispersal System. I'll give it a quick blast from my sonic, and the real time envelope will reassemble right here.
Oh, yeah, I'm over screwdrivers. They spoil the line of your jacket. These days, I'm all about wearable technology.
Oh, same old, same old. Just the Doctor and Clara Oswald in the Tardis.
It doesn't make sense.
When you were in the Dalek, you made it saymercy.. It shouldn't have understood the concept, it shouldn't have been able to say it. How did a tiny piece of mercy get into the DNA of the Daleks?
From the future.
I'm going to save my friend the only way I can. Exterminate!
Come on, I'll take you home.
I'm not sure that any of that matters, friends, enemies. So long as there's mercy. Always mercy.

Ah, well, now, that would be me.
Hello. Surprise. Boo. Et cetera.
Well, then. A new form of Dalek. Fascinating and very clever.
How did you end up in 1930?
Oh, that must have roasted up your power cells, huh? Time was, four Daleks could have conquered the world, but instead you're skulking away, hidden in the dark, experimenting. All of which results in you.
What does it feel like? You can talk to me, Dalek Sec. It is Dalek Sec, isn't it? That's your name? You've got a name and a mind of your own. Tell me what you're thinking right now.
Good. That's good.
No, that's not what humanity means.
All right, so what have you achieved then, with this Final Experiment, eh? Nothing! Because I can show you what you're missing with this thing. A simple little radio.
Well, exactly. It plays music. What's the point of that? Oh, with music, you can dance to it, sing with it, fall in love to it. Unless you're a Dalek of course. Then it's all just noise.
Run!
Come on! Move, move, move, move, move!
And you, Tallulah! Run!
Come on! Everyone up! Come on!
They're splicing themselves onto human bodies, and if I'm right, they've got a farm of breeding stock right here in Hooverville. You've got to get everyone out.
I'm sorry, Solomon. You've got to scatter. Go anywhere. Down to the railroads, travel across state. Just get out of New York.
Daleks are bad enough at anytime, but right now they're vulnerable. That makes them more dangerous than ever.
It's started.
We can't. They're on all sides. They're driving everyone back towards us.
Oh, Martha, they're just the foot soldiers.
That's not going to work.
Leave them alone. They've done nothing to you!
No, Solomon. Stay back.
Solomon, don't!
Daleks. All right, so it's my turn! Then kill me! Kill me if it'll stop you attacking these people!
Then do it! Do it! Just do it! Do it!
What's going on?
I've got to go. The Daleks just changed their minds. Daleks never change their minds.
One condition! If I come with you, you spare the lives of everyone here! Do you hear me?
Martha, stay here. Do what you do best. People are hurt. You can help them. Let me go. Oh, and can I just say, thank you very much.
Those people were defenceless! You only wanted me, but no, that wasn't enough for you. You had to start killing, because that's the only thing a Dalek's good for.
I'm sorry?
And that's good?
Is it me or are you just becoming a little bit more human?
What do you want me for?
Yeah, I found one of your experiments. Just left to die out there in the dark.
Is he dead?
Dalek ideas.
All of these people. How many?
Is there any way to restore them? Make them human again?
So they're like shells. You've got empty human beings ready to be converted. That's going to take a hell of a lot of power. This planet hasn't even split the atom yet. How're you going to do it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Empire State Building. We're right underneath that. I worked that out already, thanks. But what, you've hijacked the whole building?
What for?
Gamma radiation? What are you. Oh, the sun. You're using the sun.
The army wakes. I still don't know what you need me for.
Removing the emotions makes you stronger. That's what your creator thought, all those years ago.
He was what?
But you wouldn't be the supreme beings anymore.
So you want to change everything that makes a Dalek a Dalek.
But you're the template. I thought they were getting a dose of you.
To make them even more human?
Hold on a minute. There's no way this lot are going to let you do it.
Oh, and that's enough for you, is it?
There's no room on Earth for another race of people.
When's that solar flare?
Right then. Better get to work.
There's no point in chromosomal grafting, it's too erratic. You need to split the genome and force the Dalek human sequence right into the cortex.
These pig slaves, what happens to them in the grand plan?
Laszlo, I can't undo what they've done to you, but they won't do it to anyone else.
I know that one man can change the course of history. Right idea in the right place at the right time, it's all it takes. I've got to believe it's possible.
Then it's all systems go.
We'll be ready for it.
That compound will allow the gene bonds to reconfigure in a brand new pattern. Power up!
There goes the gene solution.
What's that?
No, no, no. The gene feed! They're overriding the gene feed!
What have you done with the gene feed?
After you.
We've only got minutes before the gamma radiation reaches the Earth. We need to get to the top of the building. Laszlo, what's wrong?
First floor, perfumery.
Oh, come here.
No, no, no. See, never waste time with a hug. Deadlock seal. I can't stop it.
Right down to the Daleks. And they're not going to leave us alone up here. What's the time?
Six minutes to go. I've got to remove the Dalekanium before the gamma radiation hits.
Oh, that's high. That's very. Blimey, that's high.
That's not we, that's just me.
No, you're going to have your hands full anyway. I'm sorry, Martha, but you've got to fight.
Oh my head.
Hi. You survived, then.
The Daleks will have gone straight to a war footing. They'll be using the sewers, spreading the soldiers out underneath Manhattan.
There's only one chance. I got in the way. That gamma strike went zapping though me first.
We need to draw fire. Before they can attack New York, I need to face them. Where can I draw them out? Think, think, think, think, think. We need some sort of space. Somewhere safe. Somewhere out of the way. Tallulah!
The theatre! It's right above them, and, what, it's gone midnight? Can you get us inside?
Is there another lift?
That'll do. Allons-y!
This should do it. Here we go.
Not now, Tallulah. Sorry.
If the Daleks are going to war, they'll want to find their number one enemy. I'm just telling them where I am.
I'm telling you to go. Frank can take you back to Hooverville.
Martha, that's an order.
It's all right, it's all right. Just stay calm. Don't antagonize them.
Oh, and what a world. With anything just the slightest bit different ground into the dirt. That's Dalek Sec. Don't you remember? The cleverest Dalek ever and look what you've done to him. Is that your new Empire, hmm? Is that the foundation for a whole new civilization?
Your own leader. The only creature who might have led you out of the darkness and you destroyed him. Do you see what they did? Huh? You see what a Dalek really is?
If I'm going to die, let's give the new boys a shot. What do you think, eh? The Dalek humans. Their first blood. Go on, baptise them.
What are you waiting for? Give the command!
No, you're not. And you never will be. Sorry, I got in the way of the lightning strike. Time Lord DNA got all mixed up. Just that little bit of freedom.
Get down!
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. You did it. You're free.
No! They can't! They can't! They can't! They can't!
They killed them, rather than let them live. An entire species. Genocide.
Oh, yes. In the whole universe, just one.
Now what?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just think about it, Dalek what was your name?
Dalek Caan. Your entire species has been wiped out. And now the Cult of Skaro has been eradicated, leaving only you. Right now you're facing the only man in the universe who might show you some compassion. Because I've just seen one genocide. I won't cause another. Caan, let me help you. What do you say?
Oh, Tallulah with three Ls and an H, just you watch me. What do I need? Oh, I don't know. How about a great big genetic laboratory? Oh look, I've got one. Laszlo, just you hold on. There's been too many deaths today.
Way too many people have died. Brand new creatures and wise old men and age old enemies. And I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, I am not having one more death! You got that? Not one. Tallulah, out of the way. The Doctor is in.
What did they say?
I don't know. Anywhere else in the universe, I might worry about them, but New York? That's what this city's good at. Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, and maybe the odd pig slave Dalek mutant hybrid too.
The pig and the showgirl.
Maybe.
What for?
Oh, yes. One day.

(singing.) 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves, Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
Come on, Bessie, be more co-operative. All mimsy were the borogroves, And the mome raths
Outgrabe. Oh, hello, Liz.
Oh, don't you be so disrespectful. I'll have you know this is a car of great character. I was very lucky to get her.
Yes, certainly. I've nearly finished my modifications. I thought we'd take her out for a trial run in a minute.
Now I wonder what that's for. Oh, well.
Oh he's away, isn't he, investigating some scientists?
My dear Miss Shaw, I never report myself anywhere. Particularly not forthwith.
No, I'm sorry, Liz. I won't go. I'm far too busy.
Twee. Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Caves? What caves?
Oh. Is it?
Oh, all right then. I'll drive you up there in Bessie.
There, Bessie.
Well, there we are. Here, hold that, Liz, will you?
There you are at last.
And just where are we?
Why? More security?
Look, may I ask you, why am I here?
Hello, Doctor Quinn.
Why?
Yes, well, that's all very well, but what is going wrong?
Naturally.
It's the most extraordinary thing. I can't seem to find my sonic screwdriver anywhere.
Well, it's not worth fifteen million pins if it doesn't work, is it?
Splendid. Come on, Liz. Doctor Quinn, which way do we go?
To the left.
You have your own nuclear reactor then?
What happens if one of these power losses occurs at a particularly crucial time?
Your nuclear reactor could turn into a massive atomic bomb.
A decision he might be reluctant to make?
Are you all right, Liz?
I'll join you later, Liz.
No, no, please do.
Quite an achievement, building this centre in these caves.
No, not for a very long time.
Until what?
You have your own doctor?
This technician, was he badly hurt?
I wonder why.
I said, I wonder why. Doctor Quinn, these power losses, do they take any particular pattern?
I see. Well, I wonder whether I could possibly check. A fresh eye, you know.
Doctor Quinn?
This log seems to be incomplete.
Hmm.
No, Doctor Quinn. I don't think it does explain it. Look.
There at the bottom of the page, by the string, the binding? You'll see a tiny shred of paper. Some of those pages have been torn out.
Ah, Liz, any luck with those records?
Yes. Depressing, isn't it.
Oh, splendid. Just the chap I wanted to see. Now look, this patient of yours, Spencer, the one who was injured in the caves. May I see him?
Oh, really? Why's that?
Doctor Meredith, as an associate of UNIT, I think you will find that I have the authority to do precisely as I please. May I now see your patient?
Thank you.
How long has he been behaving like this?
Astonishing. It's quite astonishing.
Was he much of an artist before the accident?
Excuse me. It's absolutely amazing.
Yes, all right, Liz.
What's this one, old chap?
It's all right, old chap. It's all right.
Take it easy.
Keep away, Doctor. Leave this to me. It's all right, old chap. Now calm down. Settle down now.
Calm down. That's it. Steady down now. That's it. Calm down. Nobody's going to hurt you.
Yes, I'm all right. He's just frightened, that's all.
Some kind of fear. It's absolutely incredible. It's thrown his mind back millions of years!
Oh, yes, very homely.
Where exactly is his office?
He's very conscientious, isn't he?
I wish him joy of it.
On the contrary. I've found enough to make me very, very worried.
Of course it's evidence.
Which turns him into a brilliant Paleolithic cave artist? What about the logs, then? Those torn out pages?
Ah!
Lethbridge-Stewart, what on earth is the point of my trying to discover things for you if you keep turning them down all the time.
You're not exactly a little Sherlock Holmes yourself, are you?
What the devil's that?
They're trying to close down the cyclotron without the nuclear reactions getting out of control.
Yes. Keep out of the way, I should think.
Sector three shut down.
Now what about those records, Liz.
Any pattern?
Really? In what way?
You know, it's obviously something that only affects some humans. Otherwise they'd all crack up.
No, well, not really, but it is the deepest part of the centre. And it's the nearest to those caves.
Everything leads back to those caves, Liz. Davis was killed there. Spencer was frightened into becoming a cave man.
Oh, yes?
Let's have a look.
Oh good. (reads) Immediate cause of death, fracture of the cranium. Further observations, unusual abrasions on the body, strangely resembling scratches or claw marks. Presumably caused during fall. Claw marks?
Well, this all looks very exciting. May I come too?
Anybody would think you were disappointed that I didn't get lost.
Well, it produced results, didn't it?
Oh, so you don't believe me?
Well, I hardly had time to draw its picture, did I? All I can tell you is that it was something very, very large, and something very, very alive.
Well, it was certainly some kind of dinosaur. Certainly nothing that I've ever seen before, though.
No, I do not mean in museums. Well, on second thoughts, perhaps, perhaps I do, yes.
Well, it's a possibility. I suppose.
Liz, this time I think he's right.
That's typical of the military mind, isn't it? Present them with a new problem, and they start shooting at it.
It's not the only way, you know, just blasting away at things!
I found the footprint over here somewhere.
Well it was here. Well, it's dried up, isn't it. Anyone can see that.
Come on!
It's all right, old chap. Take it easy. Take it easy.
It's all right, old chap. Take it easy. Hold him there.
Well, obviously Baker shot at something he thought was a man. Then something else attacked Baker.
Oh, it seems very likely, doesn't it.
No. I'll get back to the hospital with these blood samples. In any case I can give a hand to carry Baker.
Brigadier! You'll be careful, won't you? After all, you don't really know what you're following, you know.
Well, see for yourself.
Certain of the larger reptiles?
Precisely.
Oh, no.
Yes, I suppose so.
No, not yet. So far our tests have proved inconclusive.
Poor chap. Mind you, he was behaving very irresponsibly, blazing away like that.
Yes, but not by the thing that he shot at. Seems to me, Brigadier, that you're missing the most important point.
That when Baker was attacked, and when I was attacked, the thing was called off before it could do any real harm.
Yes, I know, but in my opinion there are two kinds of creature down in that cave. A large and ferocious one, and a smaller, much more intelligent kind that controls the first, and may not be hostile.
Yes and by that time it might be a little too late.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was looking for Doctor Quinn.
Is he in his quarters?
Don't worry, my dear. We're all under a bit of a strain at the moment.
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I'm sure he does. It's just that I'd rather like another word with him myself. It's about those power losses.
Well, that's it then. There's nothing wrong with it.
With any of it. Cyclotron, remote control mechanisms, all of them functioning perfectly.
My dear man, it's a perfectly simple piece of machinery.
The power from your reactor, like the mental state of your staff, has been affected by some outside influence.
It's more a question of what you propose to do about it. Until this influence has been discovered and dealt with, this establishment should be closed down completely.
And to your career?
Pompous idiot! Never could stand that man. Well, Brigadier, all set to start playing soldiers, are we?
And?
Poor chap.
Oh no, these were made by something quite different. Smaller perhaps, but very powerful.
Yes, but I imagine that Squire attacked him with this. (pitchfork) May have been cornered. What about the man's wife?
Yes, well, I'd like a word with her. Perhaps you'd like to stay and do some forensic tests, Liz.
Those claw marks. They weren't the cause of death, you know.
Heart failure. You might say he died of fear.
Now please, I want you tell me. What happened to your husband? Can you remember what happened to him?
She was found in the barn, paralysed with fear. She may have seen something. Have you got a pen?
And the chart please. Chart!
Now, I want you to take a look at this. Have you ever seen anything like this before.
Yes? What?
Yes?
What happened then? Where did he go?
Where?
In the barn?
Still there!
All right, officer. We can manage.
Well, give her a moment. She's just coming round.
Now, Liz, this thing. What did it look like?
Here you are, Liz. Come and sit on this. There we are. How are you feeling now?
Well, I'm not surprised.
Doctor Quinn. How did you get here?
Ah, so you're feeling better then?
I understood you didn't feel too well.
Whereabouts is your cottage?
Well, we don't know. Yet.
Doctor Quinn. I wonder whether you'd mind giving Miss Shaw a lift.
But I thought you were going straight back there.
Hmm?
Well?
Hmm. What direction did it come from?
Yes. I'm sure it came from over there. Let's go and have a look.
No, this is smaller. These are the footprints of a biped.
Here, look at these.
Anyone bringing a car here would be miles out of his way.
Oh nothing. Just a thought.
I thought you were going straight back to the research centre.
Only I saw your car was still parked outside. I thought perhaps you might have been taken ill again.
What a charming place. Mmm, charming. Lovely old grandfather clock. Is this the living room? Oh yes, very nice. Very nice. Had the place long, have you?
Centrally heated too, eh?
Yes. Still, you do keep it very warm though, don't you?
Perhaps you'd like me to look at it for you, I like tinkering with these gadgets.
Good, good. Only it is rather like the reptile house in the zoo, isn't it?
Nothing. I was just referring to the temperature of the room.
Oh? Yes, yes, of course. I'm so sorry to have taken up so much of your time.
My word, it's just as hot out here, isn't it? You really must get that thermostat fixed, you know. Anything wrong?
You'd save yourself a lot of trouble if you'd let me help you. They didn't catch it, you know.
Anything. I must know more about Doctor Quinn.
Hand me that paper knife, Liz, will you?
Thank you.
Breaking open the cabinet, m'dear. He's not going to leave anything important just lying around, is he? There we are. Now then, what have we got here? Pitons, notes. What's this? Let's have a look at these.
Some kind of a ball. It's got some markings on it. Have a look.
What's that? Let me have a look at that. Of course. This is the world as it was before the great continental drift, two hundred million years ago. And these notes, well, they're calculations on the age of the earth, with particular reference to the Silurian era.
That won't help Doctor Quinn, will it?
I'm talking about the caves, Miss Dawson.
There's something down there, and I think Doctor Quinn knows what it is. Now look, you must tell me what you know, Miss Dawson, before anybody else gets killed. Maybe even Doctor Quinn.
Warned him? Warned him about what?
Yes, Miss Dawson?
Never mind, Lethbridge-Stewart, it's too late now.
Look, I tell you, gentlemen, that the interference is definitely coming from those caves!
That, Major Baker, is precisely what we must not do at this present time.
I must say, Brigadier, that I'm delighted that you didn't agree with him.
Now look if you'd just give me a little more time
Stupid bumbling idiots, the pair of them.
To see Doctor Quinn. I must persuade him to trust me before it's too late.
Doctor Quinn? Doctor Quinn?
Doctor Quinn? Quinn?
Hello! Are you a Silurian?
Look, do you understand me? (a nod) Well, what do your people want? How can we help you? How many are there of you? Tell us what we can do!
No, wait! Wait! Wait! Unless you Silurians tell us what you want, the humans will destroy you!
Hello.
No. No, I'm afraid not.
He was, is very interested in potholing, I thought his experience with the caves might have been useful.
Oh, yes. That this establishment should be closed down completely.
And a planned, cautious, scientific investigation of those caves. Not an invasion by a lot of big-booted soldiers.
Sit down, Liz. Quinn's dead. He's been killed.
By a Silurian.
Probably the same creature that attacked you.
I spoke to it. And it understood me.
Reptilian. Biped. A completely alien species.
Liz, these creatures aren't just animals. They're an alien life form, as intelligent as we are.
Because I want to find out more about these creatures. They're not necessarily hostile.
Yes, but only to escape. It didn't kill you. It didn't attack me when I was in Quinn's cottage. Well, don't you see? They only attack for survival. Well, human beings behave in very much the same way.
Well, I'm going back down into those caves, see what I can find out.
No, Liz.
All right. Have it your own way. But the fate be on your own head. Here, you take a look at this.
It's a map of the caves that I found in Quinn's office. And look here. He's marked a special route to somewhere.
I think this is right. Hang on a minute, I'm not so sure.
No, Quinn's marked a completely different route, look.
Yes, all right. Here, wait a minute.
Look at that. A cartridge. Just been fired, too.
Well, that's Baker's.
Liz, wait a minute.
Yes, well, from now on I think we'd better stick rigidly to Quinn's route.
Come on.
What's the matter?
Yes, I know. It's very odd.
Well, well, well.
Yes, well, anyone can see that. The question is, how do you open it?
I can't understand why it didn't see us.
What's the matter?
Well, the Silurians are reptilian, you see. They've presumably created an environment inside there that suits them.
Well, I wish I knew. There's only one way of finding out, that's to get in there and see.
Yes, of course.
As a matter of fact I have. Quinn's.
(sotto) Baker!
I'm sorry, but we're alone.
Have they harmed you at all?
They can talk to you?
What do they ask?
Look, if they speak to you again, co-operate with them a little. Find out all you can about them.
They're trying to revive a Silurian from some sort of deep hibernation. Maybe that explains the power losses in the research centre.
All right, we'll get back for you as soon as we possibly can.
Good luck.
Let's try this way.
That's the creature that attacked me in the caves! They must turn it loose sometimes and use it as some kind of a watchdog.
Apparently not, Liz.
Ah, Doctor Lawrence. Just the man I wanted to see. Now tell me, have you just had a power failure?
I see, thank you.
Yes, well, I've got no time to chat to under-secretaries, permanent or otherwise. I must find the Brigadier.
You may ask.
Ah, there you are.
Brigadier, you are not to take your men into those caves. I've been down there and I know what's happening.
Huh. Spoken like a true soldier.
Well, we don't know. Maybe there are thousands.
Look, Mister Under-Secretary, surely this is a government matter. It cannot be decided at this level.
If you go down there with a party of armed men there's bound to be fighting.
Well, leave them alone. Let me try and make contact with them.
Well, so far they've only attacked in self-defence. At least let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
Miss Dawson, did these Silurians tell Doctor Quinn anything about their intentions?
There's only one thing I can do. I've got to get down into those caves and warn the Silurians.
If the Brigadier won't listen to reason, Liz, maybe the Silurians will.
Ahem. I'm sorry to burst in on you like this.
I came here to warn you that humans are about to enter your caves.
No. You don't understand. No, I've come here to I've come here to warn you.
Don't worry, help's on the way. I only wish it weren't.
I came here because I want to help you.
Look, people are coming. Many people are coming here. I want you to meet them in peace.
Well, they're soldiers, but they won't attack you unless you attack them first.
Because I want there to be peace between you and the humans. This is their planet now.
I was simply trying to prevent a massacre.
I had to take that risk. At least there's a chance they won't start killing each other.
Have you seen the humans yet? Have you spoken to them?
Please, you must listen to me. I want to talk to you.
You're making a terrible mistake. I can stop you from being destroyed.
Look, you've got no idea of the fighting power of the humans.
They've got bombs now that can wipe out whole continents.
Please, please, let me out of here. Let me out of here. Can't you see I can do you no possible harm?
But you must see this is a highly-developed and overcrowded planet which now belongs to man.
Then why did you stay down here?
A small planet? Yes, of course. But don't you see, that small planet was drawn into the Earth's orbit and became the moon? Your catastrophe never happened.
But I still don't understand why you stayed down here.
The power station at the research centre?
No, you mustn't, otherwise there'll be the most terrible war.
But if you trust me, I think I can persuade the humans that you are prepared to live with them on this planet in peace.
Oh yes, I think there is. You see, your people are used to living in extreme heat, whereas these areas on Earth are of little interest to man. I believe with your advanced technology that you could build cities in parts of the world that man has hitherto completely ignored.
Well, they're not my people, but I think I could convince them, on the condition that you release those trapped men first.
And you to them. Someone has to make a move, otherwise this whole thing will end up in complete catastrophe.
Thank you for your trust in me. I only hope it will not be in vain.
You have my assurance that I shall tell them of your desire for peace, yes.
Thank you.
You once had a great civilisation. I didn't realise how advanced.
Baker? Why, that's splendid.
But this is diabolical.
Is there any cure for this disease?
Yes. Yes, of course, but you must release me at once.
That is precisely what we must not do.
Now everyone move well away from Major Baker. Now keep right back from him. Right back.
Major Baker, you are ill. You are very, very ill.
Keep back from him! Look at your wrist. Look at it!
This whole place should be closed down and put in strict quarantine immediately.
Yes, and about time too. Well I've got to get down to the research centre and try to find an antidote.
You just don't understand, do you, Doctor Lawrence?
That is precisely what I want. But if this bacteria isn't contained there won't be anybody left to negotiate.
That's the worst thing that could have happened. Why didn't you stop him?
Brigadier, we've got to go down to the hospital straight away before Baker spreads that infection.
Meredith does not know what he's dealing with. Nobody does! Now please, do as I say.
Yes, the first one.
This man is dead. He was killed by an alien disease.
Right, you'd better get this place quarantined. I'm going back to the laboratory.
Have you finished with those prophylactic injections yet?
It's all we can do at the moment.
Well, now wait a minute, Liz
Liz
Yes, all right, have it your own way.
Did what hurt? Oh yes, it was agony.
No, not yet, I'm still waiting for that scanning microscope.
It's supposed to be on its way.
Well, I'm glad to hear it. Now then, how about that hospital?
Good, and your own men?
Splendid. Has anybody else gone down with the infection?
Yes, well, I'd be very happy to lose him. What about that chap from London, Masters?
We may be able to contain it. The question is, can we cure it? Excuse me.
Can't be sure, Brigadier. We can't be sure of anything.
Thank you.
Gone where?
Liz.
Go with him, please. Anyone who's been in contact with Masters has got to be quarantined. He may spread that disease all over the country.
Look, please hurry, this is very important, you know.
Yes, I think so. Now then, have they found Masters?
Yes, well, he's got to be found and put into quarantine at once.
No, I don't think you are. So far the antibiotics have held the disease in check. Have you finished? Good, splendid.
Thank you.
Well, it's hard to say really. I think they'll lie low for a while, and let the disease really get to work.
Brigadier, at all costs we must avoid a pitched battle.
Well don't forget that one of them released me, which is giving us our only chance of defeating this disease.
Yes. Look, Brigadier, I've got a great deal of work to do!
That's excellent, thank you.
One of those drugs, maybe a combination of them, will probably cure this disease. The question is, which?
By finding out more about that bacterium. I've already analysed it, but I need to know more about its effect. Can you get me a blood specimen from someone who's been infected?
I only hope I shan't be too late.
Good, splendid. Who did you take it from?
Oh. How is he?
I've no idea. We may be getting somewhere now, though.
My dear girl, some of these drugs are so new they don't even know their properties yet.
Right. Here goes.
No, that's no good. Let's try the next one.
No, that's no good. You know, I'm beginning to lose confidence for the first time in my life. And that covers several thousand years.
Yes, that's a possibility. Let's try.
Liz, watch what. You all right?
Yes, well, I expect those antibiotics are wearing off. You'd better get down to the sick bay and have another jab.
I'm all right.
Liz, I am all right!
Eureka!
I think I've found it.
Well, it works in the laboratory. Now let's see whether it works in practice.
You wanted to see us, Liz?
That's excellent, excellent! Yeah, there's a good chap. That's it. Now you'll want to telephone that formula to London. I'll go and write it out for you straight away.
They will all survive.
Yes, and soon all the humans will be immune to your epidemic. Your plan has failed, as your leader wanted it to fail.
But you can't do that! You can't exterminate a whole species.
I'm afraid you won't be able to do that. Thanks to you, the humans are no longer making power. Their generator has been switched off.
Do as he says, Brigadier, or they'll kill us all.
Miss Shaw is a scientist. If I am to do what you want, I shall need her help.
Stop!
No!
Any more killing I shall refuse to help you! You'll have to kill me too!
Very well. I'll do as you want.
Stop! Stop! I said there was to be no more killing! Stay where you are! This centre is now in the hands of the Silurians. They need the use of the generator. Now if you follow carefully the instructions, I shall give you, your lives may be spared.
Trying to save your lives. Now keep out of the way and keep quiet.
The power source is over here.
What is the purpose of this machine?
If I'm to help you, I must know.
Oh, for what purpose?
But if this process gets out of hand, it will destroy all life on the planet.
Yes, well, we'll need to stoke up the reactor. Miss Shaw, I'll need your help, please.
Miss Shaw, I want you to feed uranium into the reactor, all right?
(sotto) When I tell you, lower all the rods in at once.
Liz, I know what I'm doing. Please do as I say.
All technicians to your usual sectors, please. To your usual sectors, please. All right, Liz?
Lower in number one rod.
Lower in number two rod.
Sector one, increase your power level. Lower in number three rod.
Now you should be getting enough power now to get your disperser unit into operation.
As you wish. Liz, now!
Yes, I know.
Liz, keep away from those controls! Get back!
The reactor is now permanently overloaded.
There's going to be a massive explosion, and a colossal radiation leakage.
Well done, Brigadier.
I can't.
Well, I exaggerated a bit, but I had to push the reactor past the critical stage or they'd never have believed me. We'd better get out of here at once.
Why not?
Give me time, Liz, give me time. There you are. Try that now.
Yes, I know. I'll try fusing the control of the neutron flow. Now stand well back and cover your eyes.
Well, that seems to have done it.
I managed to close down the reactor.
Well done, Brigadier. Now then
I'm trying to find out how this hibernation unit works. I must know if we're going to revive them again.
Yes, not all at once, you understand. One at a time, so that we can reason with them. There's a wealth of scientific knowledge down here, Brigadier, and I can't wait to get started on it.
Yes, well, everything seems to be working quite smoothly. I don't think they'll be any more trouble.
Now, don't forget, Brigadier, nobody is to go into that Silurian base.
Miss Shaw and I will be back as soon as possible with some testing equipment and probably some other scientists.
Yes. Don't forget, Brigadier. Nobody is to go into that base, all right? I'll see you tomorrow.
No, no. No, it's just a minor technical fault. We'll soon put that right.
There you are. That's fixed it.
The Brigadier. He's blown up the Silurian base.
And you knew?
But that's murder. They were intelligent alien beings. A whole race of them. And he's just wiped them out.

Right, let's put these two together and go and find the third. Er. Oh, I see.
What?
Puzzles? You don't call that a puzzle, do you?
It certainly isn't.
Right.
Ahem. Romana, I've just decided to go and find out where our next destination is.
Have I got a treat in store for you, Romana.
Yes.
Oh, much better than Calufrax. You'll love it, I promise you. You'll love it.
Oh, sorry. Not yet. Not yet? What does she mean, not yet? What do you mean, not yet?
Oh. Oh, sorry.
(without looking) Ravishing.
Oh yes, very nicely, I should think, except for those shoes.
Well, you please yourself. I'm no fashion expert.
It's a warning, and a reminder.
If she'd been meant to know, he would have told her.
What?
If something happened to me? Yes, I suppose you have a point. Yes, I don't really think it's fair.
Romana, you were not sent on this mission by the President of the Supreme Council.
No, no, you weren't.
The voice you just heard and the being you saw in the shape of the President was the White Guardian, or to be more accurate, the Guardian of Light and Time as opposed to the Guardian of Darkness, sometimes called the Black Guardian. They can assume any shape or form they wish.
Yes. That's why our mission is so vital. Romana, the Key of Time is so powerful that it must not be allowed to fall into the hands of any one being. It's been broken up into six segments and the segments scattered through the universe and disguised as other objects.
Because there are times when the forces within the universe upset the cosmic balance so badly that the entire universe is in danger of eternal chaos.
That's what the White Guardian said. When it's fully assembled and activated, it stops everything.
Yes. So that the White Guardian can restore the balance.
Rapidly.
Hello, K9.
Hello, my dear old thing. My
That's your surprise. We've landed.
Come here. (whispers) Earth.
I thought you'd be pleased.
How do you know that?
I didn't tell everybody that.
You'll like it. It's pretty civilised, on the whole.
Do you mean it's raining?
Ah well, that's what the locals call a soft day.
Any one for tennis?
Yes, it's an English expression. It means, is anyone coming outdoors to get soaked?
Guard duty for you, K9. We don't know if the natives are friendly yet.
You know, I do believe it's going to be a nice day after all.
Yes. Pretty, isn't it?
Let's go.
Very strange.
These are.
Exactly.
Why? They don't have very heavy elephants around here. It must weigh at least three and a half tons.
Would you?
Yes. You know, I
Yes, that looks promising.
Let's go and have a look. Come on.
Well, here we are. Yes. What do you think? Fascinating, eh?
Well, it's a stone circle.
Well, it's a sort of megalithic temple cum observatory.
Just stones? Yes, they're just stones. They're all aligned with various points on the horizon, giving you sunrise and moonrise at different times of the year.
What? Primitive? No, not now. Thousands of years ago, when these were built.
Very. And clever. With some of these circles you could even calculate eclipses.
I don't know. Try.
I beg your pardon?
Ah.
Well
Doctor.
Fougous?
Who are you?
Oh! The definitive work on the subject.
What was obvious?
I do beg your pardon. That's my assistant, Romana.
So is this.
Dried blood, and quite a lot of it. Almost as if something had had it's throat cut.
How do you do? You move very quietly, Miss Fay. I didn't hear you approach.
(sotto) The leader of a Brownie pack. Doesn't the blood upset you, then?
Shush. You mean there have been sacrifices before?
Why, has there been trouble?
Really?
So you don't have anything to do with them, then.
How would I see this Mister De Vries?
I think I'll look him up.
Yes.
Well, very few people do, in my experience. Oh, by the way. Over there we noticed some indentations in the ground made by something very heavy.
Ah, very probably, yes. Over this way, you say?
How far is it?
Well, I did warn you about those shoes.
She wouldn't be told. Look, I tell you what. Why don't you hang on here and I'll stop off on the way back and bring you some boots, right?
(sotto) Listen. Keep an eye on those two. There's something very odd going on.
Right, I won't be long. Goodbye.
Farm machinery? Huh.
Anybody there?
Hello? Anybody home? Any? Nobody home except us Druids.
Thomas Borlase 1701 to 1754. Oh. Oh, so that's the good doctor.
Mister De Vries.
How did you know my name?
What?
No.
What? Maybe we should warn the Professor.
Ah. What about them?
No, I'm afraid I haven't.
Really?
Really.
Hmm. Was there a Senor Camara?
Yes, thank you, thank you. I'd like that.
That's rather an unusual pet, isn't it?
You know, Mister De Vries, you never told me how you knew my name.
No.
That's true. I'm looking for something.
Part of a key.
Oh, it's just a key. It's been mislaid. Tell me, you're not really a Druid, are you.
That must be very boring.
Well, I mean there's so little of it that's historically reliable, is there. The odd mention in Julius Caesar, Tacitus, no great detail. I always thought that Druidism was founded by John Aubrey in the seventeenth century as a joke. He had a great sense of humour, John Aubrey.
Oh. Oh, well that's a pity. What's your interest in the stones?
To whom?
The Goddess? What goddess is that?
Ah, Celtic, of course.
(to Quoth, the raven) You don't really believe that, do you, hmm?
[OC]: Romana!
Romana! Romana!
Romana!
Hello. I hope that knife's been properly sterilised.
No, no, no, no. You can catch all sorts of things off a dirty knife, you know. Lockjaw, tetanus, not to mentions staphylococcal infections
Good for you.
Hold it. Does your Cailleach ride a bicycle?
Yes.
It's just that I can see a bicycle approaching, unless I'm very much mistaken. Over here!
Help! Over here!
Phew.
Well, you know how it is, Professor. I often get tied up in my job.
Careful.
Yes, thank you. Well, I don't think they'd quite made up their minds, but that was definitely one of their options. Why have you come back?
But I thought she was with you.
What? Then where is she?
Romana! Romana! Nothing.
Yes, thank you. Ro! Look.
Yes. Romana!
Dog! Professor Rumford. May I call you Emilia? Emilia, you're a genius.
Have I got a dog.
Yeah, something like that. Come on, K9.
Look, I'll try and meet him halfway. You stay here in case Romana comes back.
Yes?
What? Yes, yes, of course. Let's hope it doesn't get too exciting, eh?
Shush. What? K9, why don't you bark or something?
Yes, well, listen, never mind about that. I've got a job for you. Now, you've always wanted to be a bloodhound
Yes, you have. Yes, you have.
Shush. Now here's your chance. Find Romana.
Don't just talk about it, K9, do it. Do it!
Good dog. Good dog. Well, go.
Romana, where are you?
What? What are you talking about?
Stop messing about down there. Here, catch hold of this.
Stop messing around down there. Come on, come on.
Come on.
Me? Never. Come on. Come on.
What's the matter?
What? You know very well who I. K9, who am I? Well, go on, K9. Tell her who I am. K9?
There you are. I'm the Doctor.
What, it looked exactly like me?
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Get you a decent pair of shoes.
Better?
Still got the tracer.
Good. I want you to check the stone circle again.
Well, it's got to be somewhere.
Well, of course it can. How's your interspatial geometry?
Good. Come on, let's go then.
Try the tracer again. Now.
Yes, that's what I thought.
This is my dog. He's called K9.
No, no, no, no. They're all the rage in Trenton, New Jersey.
Yes.
No.
Oh, that's just a little gadget.
Here somewhere.
I think I'm beginning to. Professor Rumford, er, Emilia? Come over here.
You've done a lot of research on the circle, haven't you?
Legends, folklore, history?
No, no, no, no. Where do you keep your notes?
Would you show them to Romana?
Good.
I'm going to see Mister De Vries.
Because of what he did to me. I think that Mister De Vries is a very worried man, and worried men often sing worried songs. Come along, K9.
What?
Come on, K9.
Dead. Skull smashed to pulp. So much for serving the Cailleach.
What?
I wonder where that came from?
Steady, K9.
Shush.
Seems all clear, K9.
Stone. K9?
K9?
Shush.
I'll know in a moment.
What was it?
What?
Globulin deficient.
His entire circuit's nearly all burnt out.
Oh, nonsense, K9, nonsense. We're not going to turn you into scrap yet, are we, Romana?
His only chance is an entire circuit regeneration. How can we do that in time to save him? It might be kinder to remove the cerebral core now.
What can we do?
What?
Yes, of course it was. All Type Forty's were.
Brilliant!
What? Well, I mean, it's quite ingenious. Anyway, it's worth a try.
Right. You get him back to the Tardis and connect him up. I'll stay here with the Professor and look for those bodies.
De Vries and the woman. They've been killed by that creature. You heard what K9 said.
It's globulin deficient.
It's a protein found in blood plasma. The creature that kills them lives on blood.
Anything?
Nothing. I've searched the whole house. Completely empty. No secret passages, no hidden rooms, nothing. It's got to be here, though.
Well, the Cailleach.
Yes.
Yes, I know. And so was Troy until dear old Schliemann dug it up. Morrigu, Cerridwen, call her what you like. In four thousand years I expect she's had quite a few names, but where is she? Hmm? No statues, no images, no pictures. Of course! The missing paintings! They must be here somewhere.
What? Then why have they been hidden? Tell me that. Why have they been hidden? Beware of the birds, he said. The raven and the crow. The raven and the crow. Birds!
Phew.
Well, certainly. The place is old enough. Come on!
Now mind these stairs. (bump.)
Look. Lady Montcalm, painted by Allan Ramsay.
Lady Montcalm, Senora Camara, Mrs Trefusis.
So you should. It's your friend, Miss Fay.
She isn't. She is the Montcalm family, and the Trefusis family and the Camara family. And no doubt she's the managing director of the firm that owns the circle now. These three portraits are of the same person.
So? What's a hundred and fifty years when you've been around for more than four thousand?
Yes. She's the Cailleach.
Run. Come on. Quick.
Come on, we're not clear yet. On you go.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Yes, and it's closing on us fast.
No, it isn't. We're standing still.
Maybe it doesn't realise that.
What is it, what is it?
How? Have you any plans?
Come on!
Ole!
How do you kill a stone? Let's go and find it's mistress, shall we? Come on.
There's no need to wear a mask for our sake, Miss Fay.
Well, it's all over now, Miss Fay.
Where is she?
Ah, well, you see, I can't do that, Miss Fay, because you've got something that I need, you see.
Oh, absolute nonsense.
Oh! Static electrical charge. That's a very primitive forcefield.
Why?
Three of the stones are missing.
One went over the cliff, remember?
Yes. She called them the Ogri. Ogri. Of course! The Ogri. How silly of me.
Yes, from Ogros, their home planet. That's in Tau Ceti. Repulsive place covered in great swamps full of amino acids, primitive proteins which they feed on by absorption. Hence their need of globulin
Which is the nearest equivalent on Earth, hence the blood sacrificed on the stones. Anyway, you know all about the Ogri on Earth.
That's right.
Gog, Magog, Ogres. They can't be far away. Anyway, you and I have got work to do. Listen. Do you by any chance have any tritium crystals?
Yes, tritium crystals. Tritium crystals.
Professor, listen. You go back to the cottage and see if you can find any crystals. I'll go back to my Tardis and see if I can pick up a few things.
Professor, I don't know. That's why I need the crystals.
Mmm. Well done, Professor. I knew she must have them somewhere, it's the only way she could power that wand of hers.
Yes.
Hyperspace.
Now, now, K9. K9, don't overstrain your databanks. You're not fully recovered yet.
Yes, well, didn't I give you some calculations to be getting on with?
All right, all right. Why don't you stop interrupting me and let me get on with it then? He's a terrible old gasbag.
Well, who does?
Oh, shut up, K9. It's all to do with interspatial geometry.
Well, I'm not surprised. They gave up teaching it two thousand years ago, even on Gallifrey.
Here. Look, how can I explain? Listen, Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity said
Yes. Yes, well, he was nearly right.
Yes. Absurd, isn't it?
I always thought it was fun, myself. I did try to explain the realities to poor old Albert, but he would insist that he knew best.
No, that's all right. I mean, apart from space warping, which he couldn't possibly understand, there is a theoretical way of avoiding the time distort.
Yes. Just pass me that screwdriver, will you? Yes, you operate in a different dimension, you see, in another kind of space.
Yes.
Listen. They're still in the circle, or whatever occupies that space in the other dimension.
Good. Perhaps you'll explain it to me sometime when you've got a few minutes to spare.
Yes?
Well, I don't see how I can stop you asking.
No.
I'm more from what you'd call inner time.
Yes, well, never mind about that now. K9, what do you think of this? Hmm? Well?
Yes, but will it work?
What, only on that end of the scale?
That means it'll burn out the circuits in about ten and a half seconds flat.
Thirty one point two seven. Is that long enough to get me into hyperspace?
Thank you very much, K9.
Good point, K9. Thank you. Come on, Emilia. I need your help. K9, let's go see if this works.
Now, you understand what you've got to do?
Right. Now remember, you've only got thirty seconds and then pow!
Yes. Pow. Pow. Pow is a technical expression, Professor. It means that all the microcircuitry will fuse into one great urgh of molten metal.
Ah, well that's where K9 comes in. You see, he'll generate a forcefield a touch more sophisticated than Miss Fay's, and that should keep them out for a while.
There you are. Now, if they should break through, run as if something very nasty were after you, because something very nasty will be after you.
Don't worry about me. I'll be doing plenty of that in any case.
You just switch on for thirty seconds, say, every half hour.
Well, of course it'll work and even if it doesn't work, what does it matter? You know what they say about hyperspace.
They say it's a theoretical absurdity, and that's something I've always wanted to be lost in. Ready? Now switch on.
Now!
Switch off! Switch off!
All right, all right, all right. We're not all programmed for perfection, you know. Ah, there's the fault.
Nearly finished. There, that should do it. Let's hope it works this time.
Now remember, do exactly as you did last time.
Yes.
Now!
Romana? Romana?
All change at Venus for the Brighton line.
Well, in strict order of asking, busy, nothing, hyperspace. Your friend doesn't look too well. What happened to you?
Why not?
Yes, except, apparently, the people who built this ship four thousand years ago. It's a hyperspace vessel.
Come on.
There's your answer.
Because it exists in a different kind of space from the circle.
Yes.
Maybe it ran out of fuel.
Why?
Perhaps someone's been spring cleaning.
Yeah. Romana. Romana, there's plenty of fuel. The drive unit's still working.
On what?
Yes. We'd better search the ship. The third segment must be here somewhere, to say nothing of our friend Miss Fay.
What, after four thousand years? I shouldn't think so. Mind you, I'll tell you something. If there is anything still alive, it'll be furious at all the delay. Oh!
You know, I think this must have been a convict ship.
First class in hyperspace?
I don't know. I can't read the script. Probably just says, do not open, penalty fifty pounds.
Can't see.
Open it.
I don't know.
I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. What's the Megara?
Well, it's a great relief to know that the law is in such capable hands. We have to be going now.
Never mind, just keep moving.
I did. I feared for your safety.
I'm sorry, I didn't realise I needed authorisation. You see, I'm a stranger here myself. But I promise I'll never break any other seals without authorisation ever.
What do you expect? They're justice machines. Come on. X marks the spot.
The projector Professor Rumford's using has got a very small spread. If we're not in exactly the right place when she switches on, we'll never get back. Come on, Professor.
Mmm. Are they friends of yours?
Well, yes, I'm afraid I did.
Oh, no, no, please, don't rush on my account. I'm so sorry to disappoint you.
What sentence?
No, no, no, no, no. Please, be my guest. I wouldn't want you to miss my execution.
Objection!
How can there possibly be a sentence when there hasn't been a trial.
There has been a trial. There has?
But I wasn't there.
I demand the right to defend myself.
Why not?
Machine law.
Ah. I see. Just a minute.
I wish to appeal against my sentence.
How do you know? You haven't heard my case yet.
Ahem. Could we get back to my appeal, please?
Your Honours are too kind.
Ha!
I just don't
I don't think, I don't think it would do any good. They're justice machines, remember? I knew a Galactic Federation once, lots of different lifeforms so they appointed a justice machine to administer the law.
They found the Federation in contempt of court and blew up the entire galaxy.
Thank you, Your Honour.
I call as my first witness, Miss Romanadvoratrelundar.
Hmm.
Your Honours, I'm sure that my witness wishes to withdraw that last remark, don't you.
Miss Dvoratrelundar, when we opened the hyperspace capsules, what did we find inside?
Dead things?
And when we found the hyperspace capsule in which their Honours were travelling, could you see what was inside?
What did you think was inside?
What, even creatures still alive?
No further questions.
Your Honours, I call as my second witness Miss Vivien Fay.
That's for their Honours to decide. I call Miss Fay.
I call Miss Fay.
Ha! Ha!
Trying to find out who she really is.
Well, it might just save my life.
Why else do you think the Megara are here?
Well, who else has been around for four thousand years? It's got to be Miss Fay.
Because they're justices, not policemen.
Yes. It's a pity they're also dead.
Shush. All the Megara will have is a name on the charge sheet.
Good girl.
Yes, but not for long.
I beg your pardon, your Honours. I was consulting with my associate.
Oh come, what does it matter where she goes. As we all know, no one can escape the Megara. Am I not right, your Honour?
Yes, thank you. I request that this witness be attached to the truth assessor.
What? But why? The previous witness was attached to the assessor.
I demand that this witness be treated in exactly the same way as the previous one.
Request, then.
I submit most respectfully that your Honours are in error.
But you have ruled that this witness need not be attached to the assessor because she wasn't present when the seals of your capsule were broken.
How do you know that?
That is not proof.
No, no, I don't say that. I say that she will never tell us anything approaching the truth unless she is forced to. I don't think that she'd even tell us her real name, except from fear of the assessor.
What does that mean?
Are you sure?
How do you know? You've been locked in that capsule for four thousand years! Even the finest piece of machinery deteriorates after that time. Rust, dust, pieces of fluff. Think how you'd feel if you condemn an innocent humanoid to death just because you got a bit of fluff stuck in your sprocket wheel or whatever it is you've got in there.
Very well. If you're so perfect, test yourselves, I dare you. Ask her her real name.
I thought you were on my side.
Great lawyer you've turned out to be.
Objection!
I haven't finished presenting my case yet. I have another witness I wish to call.
You're wrong, your Honour. There's one other witness I can call.
You.
Why not? Why not? I only want to put my counsel on the stand. There's nothing in the law that says I can't do that, is there? Well, is there?
Very well, I call the Megara!
I shall of course, your Honour, dispense with the oath.
Well, that's handy. Why were you sealed in your capsule?
Travelling to where?
What was the nature of your business?
Ah. A female humanoid criminal?
Of what crime had the female humanoid been accused?
Ah. And did the Great Seal of Diplos, by any chance, have any special powers?
Ha. Exactly as I thought.
Well it is to me, your Honour, yes. What is this female humanoid called?
And her description?
You have none. How do you expect to identify her, then?
You do not.
But all the officers are dead.
Then you have no way of knowing who she is.
She is Cessair of Diplos!
Why else is she here in hyperspace? What's the ship doing here?
Do you usually execute your own clients?
Mmm. Well, it certainly adds a new dimension to the role of defending counsel. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be offering me a last toffee apple or something? A blindfold, a hearty breakfast, a free pardon? No?
Ah. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
Hello. Did I short-circuit?
Is she all right?
Well, I know, I know, but can you reach her memory cells?
Well, her brain might be damaged.
You see? All you had to do was read her memory cells.
Too late. I've just been executed.
There's an Ogri behind you.
Those, Professor, are the Megara. Justice machines. They're about to carry out their sentence. I'd stand back if I were you. (to Vivien) Hello.
Oh, I wouldn't go as far as that. Excuse me, gentlemen, I think this belongs to me.
Well, that's your business completed.
What do you mean, not quite?
Delayed? Oh, I wouldn't bother about that, if I were you.
Bye, bye. Happy journey!
Back to Diplos. I took the liberty of fixing the controls on their ship before we popped back here. It should give us a couple of thousand years grace. Come on, we can't stand around here. We've got things to do. Come along.
Come on, K9.
Professor, you could write a monograph about it.
The tracer.
Sometimes it's even exciting.
Now.

Hold that one down!
Well, hold them both down.
Oi! I promised you a time machine and that's what you're getting. Now, you've seen the future, let's have a look at the past. 1860. How does 1860 sound?
I don't know, let's find out. Hold on, here we go!
You're telling me. Are you all right?
I did it. Give the man a medal. Earth, Naples, December 24th, 1860.
All yours.
Not a bad life.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Go out there dressed like that, you'll start a riot, Barbarella. There's a wardrobe through there. First left, second right, third on the left, go straight ahead, under the stairs, past the bins, fifth door on your left. Hurry up!
Blimey!
You look beautiful, considering.
That you're human.
I've changed my jumper. Come on.
Ready for this? Here we go. History.
I got the flight a bit wrong.
It's not 1860, it's 1869.
And it's not Naples.
It's Cardiff.
That's more like it!
Fantastic.
Did you see where it came from?
Be careful! Did it say anything? Can it speak? I'm the Doctor, by the way.
What's wrong with this jumper?
Gas! It's made of gas.
Rose!
Yeah, mate. Not now, thanks. Oi, you! Follow that hearse!
Why not?
Well, get in, then. Move!
Come on, you're losing them.
What did he say?
Dickens?
Charles Dickens?
The Charles Dickens?
Charles Dickens? You're brilliant, you are. Completely one hundred percent brilliant. I've read them all. Great Expectations, Oliver Twist and what's the other one, the one with the ghost?
No, no, no, the one with the trains. The Signal Man, that's it. Terrifying! The best short story ever written. You're a genius.
Honestly, Charles. Can I call you Charles? I'm such a big fan.
Fan. Number one fan, that's me.
No, it means fanatic, devoted to. Mind you, I've got to say, that American bit in Martin Chuzzlewit, what's that about? Was that just padding or what? I mean, it's rubbish, that bit.
Ah, well, if you can't take criticism. Go on, do the death of Little Nell, it cracks me up. No, sorry, forget about that. Come on, faster!
My friend. She's only nineteen. It's my fault. She's in my care, and now she's in danger.
Attaboy, Charlie.
The ladies do.
I told you, I'm your number one
Having trouble with your gas?
There's something inside the walls.
The gas pipes. Something's living inside the gas.
That's her.
I think this is my dance.
No, we're not. The dead are walking. Hi.
Charles Dickens.
My name's the Doctor. Who are you, then? What do you want?
Oh, Charles, you were there.
If you're going to deny it, don't waste my time. Just shut up. What about the gas?
Means it's getting stronger, the rift's getting wider and something's sneaking through.
A weak point in time and space. A connection between this place and another. That's the cause of ghost stories, most of the time.
Checking for strings?
Oh, come on, Charles. All right. I shouldn't have told you to shut up. I'm sorry. But you've got one of the best minds in the world. You saw those gas creatures.
And what does the human body do when it decomposes? It breaks down and produces gas. Perfect home for these gas things. They can slip inside and use it as a vehicle, just like your driver and his coach.
Not wrong. There's just more to learn.
But it's getting stronger, more powerful, is that right?
You grew up on top of the rift. You're part of it. You're the key.
Well, that should help. You can show us what to do.
We're going to have a sance.
Humbug? Come on, open mind.
Now, don't antagonise her. I love a happy medium.
Come on, we might need you.
Good man. Now, Gwyneth, reach out.
They can't get through the rift. Gwyneth, it's not controlling you, you're controlling it. Now, look deep. Allow them through.
Yes, you can. Just believe it. I have faith in you, Gwyneth. Make the link.
The other side of the universe.
What do you want us to do?
What for?
Why, what happened?
So that's why you need the corpses.
Why not?
Not decent? Not polite? It could save their lives.
They do need you, Gwyneth. You're they're only chance of survival.
Aliens.
Pretty foreign, yeah. From up there.
Close. And they've been trying to get through from Brecon to Cardiff but the road's blocked. Only a few can get through and even then they're weak. They can only test drive the bodies for so long, then they have to revert to gas and hide in the pipes.
But she can help. Living on the rift, she's become part of it. She can open it up, make a bridge and let them through.
Good system. It might work.
Why not? It's like recycling.
Seriously though, I can.
Do you carry a donor card?
It is different, yeah. It's a different morality. Get used to it or go home. You heard what they said, time's short. I can't worry about a few corpses when the last of the Gelth could be dying.
You don't have to do anything.
We need to find the rift. This house is on a weak spot, so there must be a spot that's weaker than any other. Mister Sneed, what's the weakest part of this house? The place where most of the ghosts have been seen?
Urgh. Talk about Bleak House.
Time's in flux, changing every second. Your cozy little world can be rewritten like that. Nothing is safe. Remember that. Nothing.
I'll take you somewhere else after the transfer. Somewhere you can build proper bodies. This isn't a permanent solution, all right?
Okay, where's the weak point?
I think it's gone a little bit wrong.
Gwyneth, stop them! Send them back now!
I trusted you. I pitied you!
Not while I'm alive.
I'm sorry.
Time isn't a straight line. It can twist into any shape. You can be born in the twentieth century and die in the nineteenth and it's all my fault. I brought you here.
What about me? I saw the fall of Troy, World War Five. I pushed boxes at the Boston Tea Party. Now I'm going to die in a dungeon in Cardiff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm so glad I met you.
What're you doing?
Brilliant. Gas.
Fill the room with gas, it'll draw them out of the host. Suck them into the air like poison from a wound!
Plenty more!
Gwyneth, send them back. They lied. They're not angels.
Look at me. If your mother and father could look down and see this, they'd tell you the same. They'd give you the strength. Now send them back!
Charles, get her out.
Remember that world you saw? Rose's world? All those people. None of it will exist unless you send them back through the rift.
Rose, get out. Go now. I won't leave her while she's still in danger. Now go!
Come on, leave give that to me.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. She closed the rift.
I did try, Rose, but Gwyneth was already dead. She had been for at least five minutes.
I think she was dead from the minute she stood in that arch.
Right then, Charlie boy, I've just got to go into my, er, shed. Won't be long.
You've cheered up.
Good luck with it. Nice to meet you. Fantastic.
You'll see. In the shed.
Just a friend passing through.
Oh, yes!
Forever. Right. Shed. Come on, Rose.
Down boy. See you.
In a week's time it's 1870, and that's the year he dies. Sorry. He'll never get to tell his story.
But in your time, he was already dead. We've brought him back to life, and he's more alive now than he's ever been, old Charlie boy. Let's give him one last surprise.

The Citadel of Peladon, Sarah. One of the most interesting and
Well, no, not exactly.
Yes, well, with the scanner still on the blink, there was no way I could really check.
Come on. Let's go and see where we are.
Well, I think my spatial coordinates must have slipped a bit, too. We may not actually be in the Citadel, Sarah, but we're very close to it.
Yes. Yes, the Citadel is built on a mountain, you see, and the mountain is honeycombed with tunnels like this. Come on.
Oh, have a heart, Sarah. I've been meaning to pay a return visit to Peladon for ages.
Come along, Sarah Jane.
This way, I think.
Mislaid, possibly.
For two good reasons. One, that I don't want to leave Peladon without having a word with my good friend, the King.
And second.
We are lost. Come on.
Cheer up, Sarah. We're nearly there. I recognise this tunnel.
That'll be the palace guard. We'll be all right now.
Sarah! Sarah!
Oh no, we're not. Look.
Go on, in you go.
The temple of Aggedor in the Citadel of Peladon.
There must have been a misunderstanding. Probably startled.
Ah, look at old Aggedor. There he is, bless him.
Ah, that's just a statue. You wait till you've seen the real animal.
Yes, didn't I tell you about my first visit to Peladon?
Well, Peladon was just on the point of entering the galactic Federation, you see, when suddenly they started having this trouble.
Oh well, of course, if you don't want to hear about it.
Don't worry, Sarah. As soon as King Peladon turns up
May I first know whom I have the honour of addressing?
Your Majesty. But, er, where is King Peladon?
Oh, I see. That explains a great deal.
Yes, yes, in a moment, old chap. Your Majesty, I
Your Majesty, your father and I were very good friends before you were born. I am the Doctor.
You really are a suspicious fellow, aren't you?
The answer to all our troubles, Sarah.
Alpha Centauri.
Alpha Centauri, my dear fellow, what a very well-timed entrance.
Neither have you, my dear fellow. A touch of grey around the tentacles perhaps, but still the same old Alpha.
Sarah, Sarah.
Oh, I thought that would rankle a bit.
Actually, you owe Alpha Centauri a very great deal of gratitude. Without him you'd have been lucky to have got out of there alive. They go in for rough justice here on Peladon, you know. Chop off your head and apologise afterwards.
Yes, that's a point.
Well it seems to me, Eckersley, the Federation has brought a lot of its troubles on itself.
Look, it's fifty years now since Peladon joined the Galactic Federation, and what have the miners got to show for it? Harder work for the same rewards.
Yes, well, that's another thing that concerns me, this war. I thought the Federation was dedicated to peace?
Have you tried to negotiate?
It's possible, I suppose.
I think you'll find that they are.
When miners have to take up arms to protect their rights, they probably have their reasons. I'd like to know what those reasons are.
Right then, let's see what he has to say to Queen Thalira. Come on. You two, stay here.
Not all of them, your Majesty.
Now just one moment. I brought this man here to talk to the Queen.
You really are remarkably ungrateful, aren't you?
I've just saved you from a serious political mistake. May I address your Majesty?
Your Majesty, as you know, the miners are already on the point of armed rebellion. How would they react if their leader was killed by the Queen's guards? He'd become a martyr, a figurehead for a people's revolution. Revolution and civil war, your Majesty, unless you allow me to help you.
By proving my belief that the appearances of Aggedor are caused by trickery.
Thank you, your Majesty. I'd like to begin by inspecting where Aggedor last appeared, so if someone could show me the way?
Yes, splendid. Well, after you, old chap.
Oh, so this is it, is it? All right, let's take a look inside.
Well, don't tell me that you're frightened, a big chap like you. Come on. Come on.
No wonder the Federation was so keen to mine. A typical trisilicate vein, that.
Very high grade too. And you say the light that killed Vega Nexos came from in here?
Then there should be some trace.
Blor, are you all right? Come on, up you get. That's it.
What the blazes is it?
Yes, well something killed him, poor chap. And it would have killed me too if you hadn't come to the rescue.
Wait! I think I can help you if you'll let me.
For the good of Peladon. You see, I have a special interest in this planet.
Well, find out who's using Aggedor to frighten your miners, for one thing.
Possibly. But if you can persuade your miners to go back to work, I think I can persuade the Federation to improve conditions now, and not wait until the war is over.
Exactly, and that's just what somebody wants. Now, do you think it's just a coincidence that Aggedor appeared in that cave just as I started my investigations?
Yes, well, I don't believe all that. I think the Aggedor that we've seen is nothing but technological trickery.
I don't know, but I'm determined to find out.
Nothing! We don't want any more idiotic tricks like that attack on the armoury.
You didn't stand a chance! Those armoury doors are electronically controlled from the communications room. Now that sort of thing just gets people killed for nothing. Now, please, all of you. Just sit tight and give me a chance to work things out, hmm?
Thank you, Gebek.
Splendid. Now I'd like to have a talk to Queen Thalira, preferably without Ortron breathing down the back of my neck.
Ortron doesn't give up easily, does he? Can we lose him?
Come on.
Yes, don't worry about me, old chap. I think I know my way from now on. Good luck.
Do forgive me, old chap, but you've got it all wrong.
Yes, well, I very nearly was.
Yes, I know. I've just met him in the tunnels.
My dear chap, you're just not listening, are you. No one's admitting anything. But if you'll take my advice, you'll try and get on the right side of Gebek. Without him, you've got a full scale revolution on your hands.
Look, just take me to the Queen, there's a good chap.
Well? And what did he say?
Both?
Don't be a fool!
Are you all right, Sarah?
No, I think there's more to it than that.
Yes, I know. Now don't move, Sarah.
Come on, Aggedor, old chap. That's no way to greet an old friend.
You remember me, surely?
I don't believe this. He and I used to be the greatest of friends! Aggedor! Aggedor! Yes, of course.
Klokleda partha mennin klatch. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Klokleda sheena tirri natch. Haroon, haroon, haroon.
Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon. That's better. You remember me now, don't you, old chap.
A little bit of light hypnosis. It brings out his sweeter nature, doesn't it, old chap, hmm? Come and tickle his ears, Sarah.
Well, as we were shoved down here to receive the verdict of Aggedor, I would say that the result is very much in our favour, wouldn't you? Come on, Aggedor, old chap, here we go.
Come on, get us out of here!
Come on! Visiting time's over. Get us out of here.
Well, not at all, your Majesty. In fact I was delighted to meet Aggedor again.
Thank you.
That the miners are on the point of armed rebellion, your Majesty, and that Gebek is your only hope. He's a moderate. Civil war's the last thing that he wants.
Yes, that's the trouble. Ettis has scored a considerable success with that attack of his on the armoury. Now all the young hotheads are keen to follow him.
Send for Gebek at once, your Majesty. Promise him a better way of life for his miners and see that they get it. That will cut the ground from under Ettis' feet.
You've got to convince your people that the Federation means a better way of life for everybody, not just for a few nobles at court.
I'll do my best, your Majesty.
Thank you, your Majesty.
I'll just have quick word with the Ambassador and then I'll be off. Sarah, why don't you, er, why don't you stay and have a few words with the Queen? I have an idea you could give her some good advice.
What on Peladon possessed you to do a thing like that?
Yes, well, Eckersley should have had more sense.
Yes, in a minute, Sarah. Sending for Federation troops is the one thing that is certain to make things worse. Well, I only hope I can get things sorted out before they arrive.
Yes?
Yes. And a very considerable power source too.
Yes, well it's certainly worth investigating. But first I've got to contact Gebek.
Oh, come on, Ortron, get out of my way.
(sotto) Right, I'll be off.
(sotto) Bye.
You're making a very grave mistake, Ortron.
Guard? Guard, could I have a glass of water, please?
Now, now, now, no need to be aggressive. There's no harm in trying, is there. Look, what about my glass of water?
Good health.
Ah, my glass of water at last, eh?
I say, guard. Oh, er, have you seen this?
Watch very closely. See the coin? Watch.
It's rather good, isn't it? Would you like to try it? Ah, there you are, Gebek.
Well done. Get his keys.
Give me the keys.
That'll have to wait for a while. Ortron's on the warpath.
I'd like you to take me to the Federation refinery. From what Sarah tells me, there's something singularly suspicious going on down there.
Well, I believe you, Gebek. That's why we've got to expose this Aggedor trickery before they arrive. What is it?
Yes, quite so, old chap, but still, we've got to think of first things first, eh? Come on, let's get on.
What?
Yes, well, don't worry, old chap. It's Eckersley's patent alarm system. I'll deal with the magic before we start.
Yes, that'll be it.
Yes, yes, stop worrying. I've just got one more connection to make.
That should do it. It should open now.
An excellent summing up, Commander Azaxyr. Do you know, you'd have made a very good judge?
Yes, but it's the situation on Peladon that is stopping you getting the trisilicate.
(sotto) That was different.
Commander Azaxyr. Supposing these terror methods of yours don't work. What then?
Do you see how they unite against you, Commander? It's no easy job holding down a hostile planet.
I just wanted you to see what you were up against. Thank you, Commander Azaxyr.
Don't I even get a trial?
Then I think you'd be very foolish to destroy the one person who could help you.
Yes, that's right. Gebek is the key, and I happen to be the only man that he trusts.
That's the professional attitude for you, Sarah.
And leave all our friends in the lurch? In any case, Commander Azaxyr would never let us reach the Tardis, even if we knew where it was.
Er, Sarah, you remember the first time that you went down to the refinery?
You told me that you saw something?
Well, er, go and take a close look at Sskel.
The Ice Warrior.
No, Sarah is absolutely right. Those two were in the refinery all the time.
Because Commander Azaxyr isn't acting on behalf of the Federation at all. He's up to something on his own.
Yes, that's right. (louder) Right, well, I must go and contact Gebek.
Now come on, Sskel. You heard what the Commander said. I'm to go and see Gebek, and get him to persuade his miners to go back to work. Now he can't talk to them unless I talk to him, can he?
Wait there, Sskel, I won't be a moment.
Your Majesty. Now listen to me, Gebek, we haven't got much time. I want your miners to cooperate by going back to work.
Well, it's nice to see the Peladonians all on the same side for once. (sotto) I don't mean really cooperate. I want the miners to pretend to cooperate to give us time to deal with the Ice Warriors.
Then you'll have to make them understand, won't you? Forgive us, your Majesty. Come on, we haven't got much time. Sskel?
I take it my death sentence has been lifted then?
Well, that's something, I suppose.
Oh, but of course. I've always been very keen on survival.
So much for stage one. Now for stage two, I think.
My dear Sarah, Azaxyr will kill me anyway as soon as he finds I'm no longer useful. It's just a question of my getting rid of him before he gets rid of me.
Warm things up a little. One thing Ice Warriors can't stand is heat.
I think things should be heating up nicely now.
Well, if they don't get out of the mines, they'll get groggier and groggier until
Right.
Right, it's time we were going, I think.
Won't be very safe up here once Commander Azaxyr finds out what we've been up to.
Come in here a minute.
Look, see what's going on down in the mine.
Good, the more warriors he sends down the mines, the better.
We'll lead a party of Pels back up here and recapture the Citadel.
Come on.
How are we faring?
What?
No, no, you stay here. You're the only one they'll follow. I'll go.
Well, tell me.
Yeah.
All right.
Thank you. Look after Sarah for me.
Ettis! Come away from that thing.
If you use that sonic lance, you'll be killing your own Queen and a lot of your own people. Now most of the Ice Warriors are in that mine. The Peladonians are fighting them, Ettis, soldiers and miners together, and they're winning!
Ettis!
Come on, Ettis, this is pointless.
No, Ettis, no!
Gebek.
Well, something did. The whole gun blew up.
I'm afraid he's dead. How are thing's going?
Yes, I've noticed. Well, they probably switched the ventilation system off.
Where's the ventilation controlled from, do you know?
Well, you'd better take me there straight away. And by the way, where's Sarah? Well, answer me, man. Where is she?
What?
Well, it's not your fault, is it. Now don't worry, old chap, we'll find her.
(silent) Stay there.
I'm afraid that it's Eckersley that has been summoning up Aggedor. And now he's using him to attack your miners.
No. If we show our faces in there, Azaxyr will wipe us out without a qualm. I'm sorry, Gebek. We've got to wait our chance.
How long will it take them to get back to the communications room?
That's how long we've got to get rid of our friend here, fix that alarm system and get back into the refinery.
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Luckily for me, that was Ettis.
My dear Sarah, there's nothing I like more than a quiet life. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got something very important to do in a very short space of time. Look, can you get him out of the light?
Nearly finished.
Right, that's the alarm fixed. Now for the door.
Right, that's it. In you go. (Gebek and Sarah enter the refinery as the Doctor closes up the box again.)
Right, the first thing we've got to do is switch the ventilation back on, and give those miners of yours some air.
There, that should do it.
Yes, I've seen it.
Mmm?
Oh, that's just a simple matter projector, linked to a directional heat ray. The projector sends an image of that, and the heat ray does the damage.
Yes, that's right. By Eckersley or one of his Ice Warrior friends. Very clever piece of work this. Quite an engineer, our friend Eckersley.
Directional coordinates are here.
Right, keep your fingers crossed. Here goes.
Right, we've got a chance to win now. Gebek, get back to the mines and rally your men.
Well, we'll have to make them think differently, won't we?
My dear chap, it's perfectly simple. Now all we have to do is to arrange a time and a place between us in advance. Then get all your men together.
Well, I hope Gebek's timing's right. Just about now, I think.
Oh, there are preset coordinates for almost everywhere. Eckersley's worked it out very well.
Ah. Then you must know that I'm in complete control of Aggedor. So may I suggest that you give yourself up straight away?
Ah, he's just bluffing.
Sarah, get out of here straight away. Warn Gebek. They're probably waiting for him. I'll try and help out with Aggedor.
Oh, this sort of nonsense doesn't worry me. You know that.
Sarah, please, go.
Sorry, old chap, I can't stop and talk now. I'm rather busy.
Tears?
Anyone would think you thought I was dead.
Well, even I couldn't stand the row from Eckersley's patent alarm system any longer, so I put myself into a complete sensory withdrawal.
Well, a sort of trance. I shut myself off.
Well, don't sound so aggrieved. Anybody would think you prefer me dead. Come on, let's go and find the others.
What?
How well does Eckersley know these tunnels?
Yeah, well, don't worry. I think I know a way we can track him down.
Don't move, Eckersley.
Oh, yes. Aggedor may be getting on a bit but he can still sniff out a trail. I'm sorry, old chap, but it's all over.
Get him!
Yes, well, as a matter of fact, your Majesty, I
Well, I know just the man, your Majesty. Gebek.
It's the man that counts, your Majesty. You can always give him a title.
Well, I shall always be grateful for the honour, your Majesty. But I'm quite certain that Gebek is the right man.
Well, that's splendid news. Splendid.
Yes?
Thank you, Gebek. Thank you very much. I'll go and check on it straight away. With your Majesty's permission?
In you get, Sarah. I think it's time I took you home.
In you go!

Like so.
See?
Oh, not so bad. Still a bit, you know, blah.
Sorry?
Really? What did I do that for?
Not me. I was here, in bed. Ask the nurses.
No, not any more. Just me.
Benjamin Franklin.
My mate, Ben. That was a day and a half. I got rope burns off that kite, and then I got soaked..
And then I got electrocuted.
Very good point. Brilliant, in fact. What was your name?
And it was Jones, wasn't it? Well then, Martha Jones, the question is, how are we still breathing?
Obviously we are, so don't waste my time. Martha, what have we got? Is there a balcony on this floor, or a veranda, or
Fancy going out?
We might die.
Good. Come on. Not her, she'd hold us up.
Just be glad it does.
You okay?
Sure?
Want to go back in?
Do you think?
Standing in the Earthlight.
What do you think?
I'm sorry.
I was there, in the battle.
It's not Smith. That's not my real name.
I'm the Doctor.
Just the Doctor.
Just the Doctor.
Yeah.
Well, I'd better make a start, then. Let's have a look. There must be some sort of
Forcefield keeping the air in.
How many people in this hospital?
One thousand people Suffocating.
Head's up! Ask them yourself.
Judoon.
Oh, look down there, you've got a little shop. I like a little shop.
They're like police. Well, police for hire. They're more like interplanetary thugs.
Neutral territory. According to galactic law, they've got no jurisdiction over the Earth, and they isolated it. That rain, lightning? That was them, using an H2O scoop.
No, but I like that. Good thinking. No, I wish it were that simple. They're making a catalogue. That means they're after something non human, which is very bad news for me.
Come on then.
Sonic screwdriver.
No, really, it is. It's a screwdriver, and it's sonic. Look.
I did, but it was stolen by Emily Pankhurst, cheeky woman. Oh, this computer! The Judoon must have locked it down. Judoon platoon upon the moon. Because I was just travelling past. I swear, I was just wandering. I wasn't looking for trouble, honestly, I wasn't, but I noticed these plasma coils around the hospital, and that lightning, that's a plasma coil. Been building up for two days now, so I checked in. I thought something was going on inside. It turns out the plasma coils were the Judoon up above.
Something that looks human, but isn't.
Like me. But not me.
Well, might be a shape-changer.
If they declare the hospital guilty of harbouring a fugitive, they'll sentence it to execution.
Oh yes. If I can find this thing first. Oh! You see, they're thick! Judoon are thick! They are completely thick! They wiped the records. Oh, that's clever.
I don't know. Say, any patient admitted in the past week with unusual symptoms. Maybe there's a back-up.
I've restored the back-up.
You did what?
Run!
When I say now, press the button.
Then find out!
Now!
Increased the radiation by five thousand per cent. Killed him dead.
Nah, it's only roentgen radiation. We used to play with roentgen bricks in the nursery. It's safe for you to come out. I've absorbed it all. All I need to do is expel it. If I concentrate I can shake the radiation out of my body and into one spot. It's in my left shoe. Here we go, here we go. Easy does it. Out, out, out, out, out. Out, out. Ah, ah, ah, ah! It is, it is, it is, it is, it is hot. Hold on.
Done.
You're right. I look daft with one shoe.
Barefoot on the moon.
It's just a Slab. They're called Slabs. Basic slave drones. See? Solid leather, all the way through. Someone has got one hell of a fetish.
My sonic screwdriver.
Oh, no. My sonic screwdriver.
I loved my sonic screwdriver.
Sorry.
You called me Doctor.
Funny time to take a snack. You'd think she'd be hiding. Unless. No. Yes, that's it. Wait a minute. Yes! Shape-changer. Internal shape-changer. She wasn't drinking blood, she was assimilating it.
If she can assimilate Mister Stoker's blood, mimic the biology, she'll register as human. We've got to find her and show the Judoon. Come on!
That's the thing about Slabs. They always travel in pairs.
What about me what?
Oh. Humans. We're stuck on the moon running out of air with Judoon and a bloodsucking criminal, you're asking personal questions? Come on.
And again.
They've done this floor. Come on. The Judoon are logical and just a little bit thick. They won't go back to check a floor they've checked already. If we're lucky.
How are you feeling? Are you all right?
Welcome to my world.
Nah, great big lung reserves. It won't slow them down. Where's Mister Stoker's office?
Drained him dry. Every last drop. I was right. She's a plasmavore.
Hiding. On the run. Like Ronald Biggs in Rio de Janeiro. What's she doing now? She's still not safe. The Judoon could execute us all. Come on.
Think, think, think. If I was a plasmavore surrounded by police, what would I do?
Ah. She's as clever as me. Almost.
Martha, stay here. I need time. You've got to hold them up.
Just forgive me for this. It could save a thousand lives. It means nothing. Honestly, nothing.
Have you seen them? There are these things. These great big space rhino things. I mean, rhinos from space. And we're on the moon! Great big space rhinos with guns on the moon. And I only came in for my bunions, look. I mean, all fixed now. Perfectly good treatment. The nurses were lovely. I said to my wife, I said I'd recommend this place to anyone, but then we end up on the moon. And did I mention the rhinos?
Er, that, that big er machine thing. Is it supposed to be making that noise?
But isn't that a magnetic resonance imaging thing? Like a ginormous sort of a magnet? I did magnetics GCSE. Well, I failed, but all the same.
Ooo, that's a bit strong, isn't it?
But er, hold on, hold on, I did geography GCSE. I passed that one. Doesn't that distance include the Earth?
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me, I'm a little out of my depth. I've spent the past fifteen years working as a postman. Hence the bunions. Why would you do that?
No, that's weird. You're talking like you're some sort of an alien.
No!
You're joshing me.
I'm talking to an alien? In hospital? What, has the place got an ET department?
So, those rhinos, they're looking for you?
Right. Maybe that's why they're increasing their scans.
Big chief rhino boy, he said, no sign of a non-human, we must increase our scans up to setting two?
What does that mean?
Well, you're welcome to come home and meet the wife. She'd be honoured. We can have cake.
Oh, that's nice. Milkshake? I like banana.
What are you doing?
Soddit.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, please. Come on, Judoon, reverse it.
It's raining, Martha. It's raining on the moon.
A bit more peaceful than down here.
The Doctor.
I'm a Time Lord.
I just thought since you saved my life and I've got a brand new sonic screwdriver which needs road testing, you might fancy a trip.
Well.
If it helps, I can travel in time as well.
I can.
I'll prove it.
Told you.
Crossing into established events is strictly forbidden. Except for cheap tricks.
It's called the Tardis. Time and Relative Dimension in Space.
Take a look.
Is it? I hadn't noticed.
Right then, let's get going.
Just me.
Well, sometimes I have guests. I mean some friends, travelling alongside. I had. There was recently, a friend of mine. Rose, her name was. Rose. And we were together. Anyway.
With her family. Happy. She's fine. She's. Not that you're replacing her.
Just one trip to say thanks. You get one trip, then back home. I'd rather be on my own.
That was a genetic transfer.
Now, don't!
Stop it.
Good. Well, then. Close down the gravitic anomaliser, fire up the helmic regulator. And finally, the hand brake. Ready?
Off we go.
Welcome aboard, Miss Jones.

No, the signal's definitely coming from the moon. I'm blocking it, but it's trying to break through. Donna!
I'm doing it.
Maybe. It's getting harder to tell. What's wrong with you?
They won't attack until there's enough of them. But they've got our scent now. They're coming.
There's a signal coming from somewhere, interfering with it.
It doesn't have a red setting.
It doesn't have dampers.
So, some time in the future, I just give you my screwdriver.
Why would I do that?
And I know that because?
Less emotional? I'm not emotional.
Young? Who are you?
Yeah, we're good.
Know what's interesting about my screwdriver? Very hard to interfere with. Practically nothing's strong enough. Well, some hairdryers, but I'm working on that. So there is a very strong signal coming from somewhere, and it wasn't there before. So what's new? What's changed? Come on! What's new? What's different?
It's a screwdriver. It works in the dark. Moon rise. Tell me about the moon. What's there?
What's a Doctor Moon?
Well, still active. It's signalling. Look. Someone somewhere in this library is alive and communicating with the moon. Or, possibly alive and drying their hair. No, the signal is definitely coming from the moon. I'm blocking it, but it's trying to break through.
Donna!
Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm trying to find the wavelength. Argh, I'm being blocked.
Hang on.
No, no, no. I just tinted her visor. Maybe they'll think they're already in there, leave her alone.
Maybe. I don't know. It's a swarm. It's not like we chat.
Just, just, just stay back. Professor, a quick word, please.
Down here.
Look, you said there are five people still alive in this room.
So, why are there six?
Run!
Professor, go ahead. Find a safe spot.
Five minutes.
You hear that? Those words? That is the very last thought of the man who wore that suit before you climbed inside and stripped his flesh. That's a man's soul trapped inside a neural relay, going round and round forever. Now, if you don't have the decency to let him go, how about this? Use him. Talk to me. It's easy. Neural relay. Just point and think. Use him, talk to me.
The Vashta Nerada live on all the worlds in this system, but you hunt in forests. What are you doing in a library?
In a minute. You came to the library to hunt. Why? Just tell me why?
Oh, hello.
Take it easy, you'll get the hang of it. Did not what?
Well, of course you did. Of course you came here.
From here?
But you hatch from trees. From spores in trees.
You're nowhere near a forest. Look around you.
You're not in a forest, you're in a library. There are no trees in a (the penny drops) library.
Books. You came in the books. Microspores in a million, million books.
Oh, look at that. The forests of the Vashta Nerada, pulped and printed and bound. A million, million books, hatching shadows.
Oh, Dave! Oh Dave, I'm so sorry.
Thing about me, I'm stupid. I talk too much. Always babbling on. This gob doesn't stop for anything. Want to know the only reason I'm still alive? Always stay near the door.
Spoilers. Nobody can open a Tardis by snapping their fingers. It doesn't work like that.
I am the Doctor.
How are you doing?
Not coming. Sorry.
I don't know. Maybe tinting your visor's making a difference.
Can I get you anything?
I'm all over it.
Safe.
Safe. You don't say saved. Nobody says saved. You say safe. The data fragment! What did it say?
Nobody says saved. Nutters say saved. You say safe. You see, it didn't mean safe. It meant, it literally meant, saved!
See, there it is, right there. A hundred years ago, massive power surge. All the teleports going at once. Soon as the Vashta Nerada hit their hatching cycle, they attack. Someone hits the alarm. The computer tries to teleport everyone out.
It succeeded. Pulled them all out, but then what? Nowhere to send them. Nowhere safe in the whole library. Vashta Nerada growing in every shadow. Four thousand and twenty two people all beamed up and nowhere to go. They're stuck in the system, waiting to be sent, like emails. So what's a computer to do? What does a computer always do?
The library. A whole world of books, and right at the core, the biggest hard drive in history. The index to everything ever written, backup copies of every single book. The computer saved four thousand and twenty two people the only way a computer can. It saved them to the hard drive.
In twenty minutes, this planet's going to crack like an egg.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What is it? What is Cal?
It's at the core of the planet.
I bet I like you.
The data core. Over four thousand living minds trapped inside it.
The computer's in sleep mode. I can't wake it up. I'm trying.
I know. You'd think it was dreaming.
Cal is a child? A child hooked up to a mainframe? Why didn't you tell me this? I needed to know this!
So you weren't protecting a patent, you were protecting her.
And then the shadows came.
And she saved them. She saved everyone in the library. Folded them into her dreams and kept them safe.
Because she's forgotten. She's got over four thousand living minds chatting away inside her head. It must be like being, well, me.
Easy! We beam all the people out of the data core. The computer will reset and stop the countdown. Difficult. Charlotte doesn't have enough memory space left to make the transfer. Easy! I'll hook myself up to the computer. She can borrow my memory space.
Yeah, it's easy to criticise.
I'll try my hardest not to die. Honestly, it's my main thing.
I'm right, this works. Shut up. Now listen. You and Luxy boy, back up to the main library. Prime any data cells you can find for maximum download, and before you say anything else, Professor, can I just mention in passing as you're here, shut up.
I know!
These are their forests. I'm going to seal Charlotte inside her little world, take everybody else away. The shadows can swarm to their hearts' content.
Best offer they're going to get.
They'd better take it, because right now, I'm finding it very hard to make any kind of offer at all. You know what? I really liked Anita. She was brave, even when she was crying. And she never gave in. And you ate her.
But I'm going to let that pass, just as long as you let them pass.
I counted the shadows. You only have one now. She's nearly gone. Be kind.
I'm giving you back your forests, but you are giving me them. You are letting them go.
Don't play games with me. You just killed someone I liked. That is not a safe place to stand. I'm the Doctor, and you're in the biggest library in the universe. Look me up.
I'm sorry. She's been dead a while now. I told you to go!
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on, what are you doing? That's my job.
Why am I handcuffed? Why do you even have handcuffs?
This is not a joke. Stop this now. This is going to kill you! I'd have a chance, you don't have any.
River, please. No.
You can let me do this.
Time can be rewritten.
River, you know my name.
You whispered my name in my ear.
There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could.
Any luck?
Maybe not.
Everything. Sorry, did I say everything? I meant to say nothing. I was aiming for nothing. I accidentally said everything.
I'm always all right.
Why?
Come on.
Donna, this is her diary. My future. I could look you up. What do you think? Shall we peek at the end?
Right.
Come on. The next chapter's this way.
Why? Why would I give her my screwdriver? Why would I do that? Thing is, future me had years to think about it, all those years to think of a way to save her, and what he did was give her a screwdriver. Why would I do that?
Oh! Oh! Oh, look at that. I'm very good!
Saved her.
Stay with me! You can do it, stay with me! Come on, you and me, one last run!
Sorry, River, shortcut!

There. That should immobilise her for the moment.
When making modifications, it's extremely important to shut everything down except that which is not necessary to shut down. Well, of course. Terribly easy to damage things otherwise.
Ow! Like me, for instance. I'd better disconnect that. Good, that should hold her steady.
How can it be? I just completely immobilised her.
Good, good.
What? But K9, how can it be?
What do you mean, he could be right? How could he possibly be right? He's only a dog, you know.
We do seem to be moving.
Yes. But everything's off. Except what's on, of course.
Well, I've just been trying out a little idea I had for a slight modification of the conceptual geometer.
So what?
No, I don't. What could possibly go
Ow! Wrong. You know, I've simply got to stop saying that. Every single time I say what could possibly go wrong, something goes
Oh! It's uncanny, isn't it?
There are no planets in the sector.
Romana, do you think I'd dismantle half the control systems including the conceptual geometer, the dematerialisation circuits
The dematerialisation circuits. Do you think I'd do that if there was the slightest risk of our being brought into a gravitational field?
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Stay calm. Watch.
There we are. Look. Nothing. Blackness.
Romana, we're moving very fast.
No. It's not pulling hard enough for that. Anyway, there's nothing charted.
Fascinating, isn't it? I wonder what it would be like to be crushed to a singularity?
Hmm? What?
Oh, right, right. K9. We'll put it together again. I need your help, K9.
Ow! You all right, K9?
K9? K9, are you all right? K9!
K9. Come on, boy. Sorry about this, K9.
K9, all you all right?
Good, good.
It's all right. It's only the defence shields.
Yes, of course. I can fix anything, given time.
What?
How interesting. Ha, looks like a spaceship.
It's no good. I can't fix them in time.
Yes.
What is it, K9?
What?
You were right, K9. We have arrived.
Well, we're jammed up against that spaceship. Pretty battered old ship. Been here for years. Centuries, probably. I think we'll go and take a look.
No. Ah, here's a notion. The defence shield on the door's on a different circuit. It might be possible to extrude it.
Watch.
There. What do you think of that?
It was nothing, nothing. K9?
Romana?
Let's go.
Ah ha.
Oh, how commonplace. It looks like a crystalline rock of some kind.
Yes, I do believe it is.
What?
Thank you, K9. And now?
Good. Now listen, K9. We're going to explore this ship and see what makes it tick.
Not that sort of ticking, K9.
Listen, I want you to go back to the Tardis control room and check out all the damage. Inspect all circuits so we see what we need to put right.
Off you go then.
Oh, yes. No one in his right mind would mix hymetusite and passengers.
Hmm. Door's locked.
Hello. How long have you been here, eh? Come, it's all right. Don't be frightened. Don't be frightened. Here, have a jelly baby. Go on, go on.
Oh, it's all right. Go on, you show them.
There we are. Now you have one. Go on, you can do it.
No, I'll have that one. Here, pass them round. One each. Now, how long have you been here?
Well, I'm the Doctor. This is Romana. Who are you?
Aneth! That's a charming place.
Yes, but not yet.
Nowhere.
Skonnos?
What?
No, that's all right. I heard what you said. I was just thinking what a curious thing to be.
What?
Yeah, well, here, as you so rightly say, we are. Huh.
Another thing's been drawn into the ship.
Yes. Sargasso Sea in space. Romana?
Suppose, just suppose, someone were beginning to create a black hole.
Artificially, I mean.
Oh, yes. Fix gravity beam, attract matter to one point in space, and when there's enough it starts to collapse to a singularity. But who'd want to do that?
I'd say it was increasing.
Unless we find a way of getting out of here, we're all going to be crushed to a singularity.
Oh, never mind about that. Seth, who's in charge of this ship?
Ah, pleased to see you.
Sacrifices?
No!
Well, that's a good question. Er, can you get us out of here?
I might be able to. Why don't you put that thing away and show me your controls?
Aren't you going to put that thing away?
Well, all right, if that's the way you want to play it.
Though how I'm going to mend the controls with my arms up in the air like this
Hello, who's that?
Ah.
What?
But the ship hasn't crashed.
I don't like the sound of that.
These engines have seen better days.
Well, the sooner the better. It's a right hodge-podge up there. Very old engines patched up with new equipment, a lot of it not really compatible.
Yes.
The odd thing is, the new equipment seems to be the product of an entirely different technology.
Have to noticed how people's intellectual curiosity declines sharply the moment they start waving guns about?
Yes. Oh yes, I can make it work. The question is, can we generate power soon enough to take the ship to escape velocity before we fall into a black hole with an event horizon.
Shush. You just hold the gun steady. Don't tax your mind.
Not with that fuel.
Brilliant! I wish I'd thought of that.
Ha ha. Take a look.
Now, I've got to go back to my own ship to get some things. I want you to fetch up two pieces of hymetusite to lower into the fuel cell. Look, why don't you give me the gun and then I can keep an eye on myself so that I don't get up to any funny business?
All right. What do you think, Romana?
Yeah. Well, listen. As soon as he brings the hymetusite
Good girl, Romana. Now listen. I'm popping back to the Tardis to get some gear. Here, take this. You might need it.
Oh, really? Really? You made this? Not bad. Bit basic though. Huh. Thank you.
Yes? Oh. Ha, ha. So sorry.
Now, be kind to them.
K9?
Ah, there you are. How's it going, K9?
And?
Well, I know that.
We're up a gum tree without a paddle.
Well, it's a tree that gives gum.
You wouldn't understand, K9.
How's the dimensional stabiliser?
Gravitic anomoliser?
Good, good. I'll take that, then, and one or two other bits and pieces. Oh, by the way, K9. Skonnon Empire. Does that mean anything to you?
We're almost there. Get back to the flight deck and switch on the engines.
Then you wait until I come and give you the signal to start building up power. Hurry! And don't forget to wait for the signal.
Right, now as soon as he switches on the power, you know what to do.
Good girl.
I'm going to move the Tardis into the hold of this ship, then we can ride out with it, park somewhere and repair it with as much time as we like.
Well, it would be if the dimensional stabiliser was working. It's all right, it's all right. K9 said it's just fused.
Hello. Have some more jelly babies.
Not that bit, K9, that bit.
Ow!
What is it, K9?
Yes, that's just what I thought.
We've been abandoned, K9!
The co-pilot.
The weasel.
Poor Romana.
What is it, K9?
Looks like an asteroid. What do you make of it?
Two hundred and twenty million tons? That's not an asteroid, that's a planet!
Nine point three? It's coming right for us!
Estimated time to impact?
How long have we got?
That's what I said.
Eighty nine point four seconds. No dematerialisation, no defence shields, and only half power on full drive. K9, I think we're going to find out what it's like to be a cricket ball. Well, it's been a great, great partnership, old girl.
Oh, come on, K9. This is no time for emotional quibbling, you two. You've been a good dog to me, K9.
The best I ever had.
It's a pleasure.
I wish you wouldn't say things like that, K9. Fifty eight seconds dead. Did I say cricket ball?
Brace yourself, K9. This is it.
K9? K9? Are you all right, K9?
How am I, K9?
Oh. Oh, good! Good, good. Well, let's hope the same is true of the Tardis. You're a good boy, K9.
Ha ha! We did it!
Well, I just put a lot of spin on the Tardis, and the asteroid simply sliced us up out of the gravity whirlpool. Oh, you know, K9, sometimes I think I'm wasted just rushing around the universe saving planets from destruction. With a talent like mine, I might have been a great slow bowler.
Right, K9. Without our gravitic anomoliser, this is the best we can do. Let's give it a try, shall we? Ah, come on, old girl.
That's very odd. Wouldn't you say that was odd, K9?
Right, here we go again. After five, four, three, two, one. (nothing) Come on.
Ah ha! Success at last, right, K9? Let's try and find our way to Skonnos and recover our gravitic anomoliser.
And Romana. Don't forget Romana. Tut, tut, tut.
There we are. Hello, that looks interesting. Reminds me of something. Yes, I think we'll take a look in there to start with.
Why should that be, I wonder, K9?
Yes, just as I thought. Oh well, never mind. We'll just have to land somewhere near it. Somewhere unobtrusive.
Ah, good morning. Or is it evening here? Lovely day, isn't it? Wasn't it? No?
Oh no, not again. How is it wherever I go in the universe there are always people like you pointing guns or phasers or blasters? Now don't do anything hasty. It's just a flying visit. Take me to your leader.
Ah, hello. I'm the Doctor.
Yes. I just dropped in.
Mmm. You must be Soldeed.
I thought so.
Thank you. I say, that looks interesting. Very interesting.
Having a little trouble with the neutrino converter?
Neutrino converter.
Oh, I've seen similar things here and there.
How very odd, how very extraordinary, then, you don't know what a neutrino conversion is. Did you know that someone's building a black hole on your doorstep?
Yes. I got stuck in it, along with one of your spacecraft.
Yes, yes. A good thing I got stuck in it, too, otherwise your ship would still have been there.
Yes, well, with a little help from my friend. Nice girl. I don't suppose you've seen her, have you? Blonde, about so big, always sticking her nose in things that don't concern her.
I just thought she was heading this way.
Oh, no idea what I'm talking about? How do you explain that, Soldeed?
It's my gravitic anomoliser from my Tardis. (to Sorak) Now, where's Romana?
Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I'd like to say one thing and let me make it perfectly clear, I stand before you desperate to find the exit. Can anybody help me?
Hello, is this a private party?
Or can anyone join in? So you're the mighty Nimon, eh?
Tell me, Nimon. Tell me, are you really terribly fierce. Hmm? Is it true that you're very, very, very fierce?
Hello. What are you doing skulking down here.
Oh yes, of course, yes.
Oh, I don't know. You call this a maze? It's a cheat!
Well, the walls keep changing.
Just a minute. I saw this place from above just before I landed. It reminded me of something.
I can't think what.
No, no, no. He'll be too busy repairing his furnace.
No, no, he has another use for those altogether.
Yes.
Looked like a nuclear reactor to me.
Yes, your tribute had a very practical purpose. I think there's something horribly evil going on here. Let's go, shall we? Where are the others? Well?
What! Come on. Come on!
It's this way, I think.
Why not?
That's right.
Well, of course not. Whatever gave you that idea?
That I was trying to find a way out. Oh no, we've got to go deeper into the complex.
Right. Come on, this way.
Maybe it's this way.
Ah ha! This is more like it.
Just as I thought.
It certainly is. What do you make of it?
Yes, of course, with the horns on the top as the antennae.
Energy.
Yes, but for what purpose?
Yes. I think it's about time someone else found out.
Give me that.
Seth and Teka, come here. Take that. I want you to guard the door and look out for the Nimon, hmm?
Tell me and then run, in that order.
Got it!
Now I know what this place reminded me of when I saw it from the Tardis.
A giant positronic circuit.
And the reason why the walls keep changing is when the circuit's in operation
Exactly.
Need a computer to find that out.
Got it! K9.
Certainly, certainly. Well, I should think so. I mean, he could follow our psychospores, couldn't he?
Got it! No, I haven't.
No. I thought for a moment it was a giant transmat.
That's right. It's a direction beam of some kind, though.
Yes. Wait a minute. That's some kind of bearing. Of course! It's focused on the black hole.
Well, we said it was artificially created.
Yes.
It could be a gateway towards hyperspace.
Yes.
I don't know, but I'll tell you something interesting. When I mentioned the black hole to Soldeed, he didn't seem to know what I was talking about.
Exactly. If Soldeed doesn't know about the black hole, what does he think all this if for?
Come on, K9.
That was quick. Good old K9.
Quick, come on. Hide! Hide!
I want to find out what he's doing.
I don't know what he's doing. Whatever it is he's doing, I think we're too late to stop him doing it.
What?
Yes.
It wouldn't need engines, would it, Romana.
Two black holes. One at the beginning of the journey, one at the end, and a hyperspatial tunnel in between.
Yes.
That's right.
So did Soldeed. They've been terribly clever. Fiendishly clever.
Invasion.
Yes, it happens all the time. When a race runs out of space or destroys its home, it has to find somewhere else to live.
Yes.
Yes.
Well
Millions.
Well, as more arrive, they'll build more transmats and increase exponentially. You don't imagine this is the only planet that's been tricked, do you? We've got to stop them.
Seth and Teka
Right.
We're going to have to be very clever. Power on this scale could blow the whole planet to bits if I touch the wrong thing. Romana?
I want to know everything about that capsule.
Everything.
It's all right.
I think I've found the main power control.
Yes. If I can reverse the flow, the energy will go back to where the space-time tunnel begins.
Yes. I might even be able to send the Nimons back again.
There, that should do it.
I said that should do it.
Come on. Ah ha. Romana? You're
She must have been inside the capsule.
Well, I'll have to switch the whole thing back. Let's hope we've got time.
It's all right, I can explain everything.
No, well, you see what happens is
Romana.
Seth, well done!
No, just knocked out. Right, now let's see what the damage is. Oh, I don't like the look of that. Sorry, Romana.
It's very bad. I might just be able to fix it if I can cannibalise one of the other circuits.
No, no. You've done enough. It's K9 I need now.
Oh, my gravitic anomoliser.
It might help. You see, it's an entirely different system but it just might be compatible.
Well, if it's compatible it'll work better than the original. On the other hand, if it's not compatible
There'll be a bang so big you won't even hear it.
He'll warn the Nimon. Quick, after him!
Ah.
Welcome back, Romana.
Oh, my prophetic soul!
Ah, hello there. I was just
Well, really, I was just standing admiring the view.
Well I hope you get it in the right order.
Yes, you see, well, that's what I was trying to explain. When I
No, but what I thought was
Thank you.
Thank you, Seth.
I'll do better than that. I'll lock it off for good. Romana?
I think we're going to be all right.
K9!
Well, you took your time getting here. Never mind, now you're here you can make yourself useful.
What do you mean, what is it? It's my dog.
He's called K9. K9? I want to modify the controls. I want to divert the space-time tunnel and send the Nimons back into the middle of nowhere. What do you think?
Good, good.
Well, if the Nimons got her, she'll be in the larder.
I'll meet you both there. Go on, off you go.
K9, this is going to be a bit sticky.
No, they're not, they're just paralysed. K9, get them out quickly.
Well, you're not saved yet. Come on, let's get out of here before the whole place explodes. Come on!
Halt. Shush.
Ah, but they didn't have a brilliant tracker dog like K9, did they. He can follow the scent all the way to the exit. Come on, K9. Come on.
What is it, K9?
What? Come on, K9. You can do it.
What? But it can't be. Try pointing the staff.
In the name of the Second Skonnon Empire!
K9, what do you make of that wall in front of you?
There! There in front of you.
No, no, the wall.
Shush. Just a minute. K9, is that a wall in front of us?
Then off you go, then.
Ah, a very clever illusion. Quick, everybody through. Quick! Quick!
Everybody take cover. The whole place is about to explode!
Well, I never finished the modifications to the conceptual geometer.
Yes, well, what could possibly go wrong out here?
I've said it hundreds of times before.
Oh, four or three.
Oh, not much better. Nasty race of people. Still, they're too busy fending for themselves to bother anyone else now.
Hmm?
Crinoth.
Good job, too.
I should hope so. I made Sorak give them a ship.
Poor old Seth.
Yes. Well, just imagine the legends Teka's going to build up around him. He'll have to spend the rest of his life trying to live up to them. It's terrible.
Yes. I'm glad this time I reminded them to paint their ship white. The last time anything like this happened, I completely forgot. Caused quite a hoo-ha.
Hmm? Oh, other times, other places. Well, come on, old girl. There's quite few millennia left in you yet.
Not you, the Tardis.

Ow!
What have I done?
Well, I can't get everything right.
One must always accept the unexpected.
Well, that's different. This is the second time I've missed the opening of the Brighton Pavilion.
What?
Well, I can't spend the rest of my life running away from the Black Guardian.
Do you have a better suggestion?
What?
Fascinating?
Argolis? Tell me about it.
It's got to be unreal transfer.
It's the only way to manipulate solid objects.
Then how is it done?
Yes. Nobody there did much with it.
Do you know, I'd completely forgotten about tachyonics. Some of those Argolin solutions are really quite neat.
Yes.
I suppose in theory a tachyon image could never be permanent.
Something's gone wrong!
I'm a doctor.
He's terribly hurt. Come on, clear the area. Clear the area!
His mother?
Yes, but who's in charge here?
His mother? Good. You, take me to his mother. Come, Romana on.
Hello. How do you do? (to Klout) Who are you? I've got something very special here. You'll like it.
Who am I? Ask him.
No, but it's a very understandable mistake.
Ah, well, we must have missed the usual channels, as usual.
Well, just a glimpse, perhaps.
You spotted that? Good. Let's get back to the Tardis.
No, thank you. We're just on our way out, actually. Oh, by the way, there are two unauthorised visitors on the premises. Keep an ear cocked for a description.
Don't let me interrupt you, gentlemen. Two discontinuous holograms have been edited together.
Yes, I noticed vague interference patterns.
What?
Oh, yes, yes, that too of course.
Why are they so competitive?
I wonder. I wonder.
Fascinating. Fascinating.
Well, you could try shorting the servo lock on the door.
Well, it's just a thought. Something wrong?
Handsome fellow, isn't he? One of your tachyon images. It'll disappear soon, look.
See?
Through a hole in the back.
There is now.
You see, a common fault with tachyon particles is that they can induce a certain temporal instability in surrounding matter.
What can I do for you?
Come on, Romana, quick.
Gallifrey?
Well, it's just an obscure little planet in the constellation of Kasterborous and we're overdue. I think we should be on our way.
Well, yes, but in a purely academic way of no interest to anyone.
Well, I'd like to
Yes, there you are, so sorry.
Well, just a glimpse, perhaps.
All right, but we'd better rerun the experiment, don't you think, Mister Hardin?
Yes. Radon 222 decays rapidly.
Really? Why, how long did the war last?
As long as that.
So it's not just a recreation centre.
Do you think the Hive's being interfered with?
We could do with that in the Tardis.
Yes. This Leisure Hive is the Argolin farewell gesture.
What is it?
Normal? But you're ill.
Shush.
Is that a Schrdinger oscillator?
Why?
Oh, really.
Ah, so that's how it's done.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Yes.
Arrest the scarf, then.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Evidence? Evidence? You couldn't hang a hat on that.
I'm sorry.
I've got an idea. There's a sort of blue box down the hall. You could imprison us both in that.
Are you sure about this, Romana?
Right. Then I'll take my chance.
Was I in there long? It felt like centuries.
Yes, I think so. A bit weak. Why? What are you all staring at?
No, not recently. Why, should I
Is that me? What happened?
I was just going to check something in there. I can't remember what.
I'm sick of being old. There must be some way of reversing the process.
Pangol's very young.
Yes. And everyone else is old, except Pangol. And he runs the Generator. When you were fitting the Schrdinger oscillator, did you notice there were two baryon shields?
I don't know. I didn't have time to look. Five hundred years goes by so rapidly.
Yes. Yes.
Really, it's astonishing how far the Argolins have come with tachyonics.
Really? Are you sure of that?
No, nothing except a sort of cabinet of illusions. And then the name of the thing. Has that struck you?
Recreation Generator. Re-creation.
Things, yes. Or people.
This way.
The radiation out there affected the Argolin metabolism.
Yes, and made them sterile.
The implications of that could be very unpleasant.
Yes, or else there might be, what do you call it?
Yes. Or even a plan would do.
Look at this, old thing.
Do you know, I had a feeling he wasn't quite ready for the rigours of warp mechanics.
Hadn't you better get him off to bed?
There's no doubt about it, all this rushing about takes it out of you, particularly when you're twelve hundred and fifty years old.
Who is he?
What? Doesn't make any sense to me.
Shush. Don't interrupt. He's a Foamasi.
I don't know. Ask him.
Of course. Of course.
I wish I knew what you wanted, friend.
Of course. Come on, let's go then. Come on.
Back to the boardroom. Our scaly friend's seen someone he wants to talk to.
Well, you can trust me, that's the important thing.
Oh no, I've got a surprise for you all.
Mmm, it looks genuine to me.
If it has ended.
Don't cross your bridges before they're hatched.
Please get on with it. There's so little time.
The Tardis.
Perfect. What a stabilising matrix.
The anti-baryon shield. Anti-baryon shield. Anti-baryon shield. Now, where was it, exactly?
It's terribly simple. It's a tachyon image. Outwardly Pangol, inwardly me. Unfortunately, these tachyon images are very unstable.
Or fortunately, depending on your point of view.
Come on, we've got work to do.
Shush, careful.
The first one, actually.
The first one out of the Generator.
It's hard to tell.
Yes, I feel real enough. Yes, it's holding up quite well so far.
That's me nearly complete. Where's my coat?
FIFO stack? Yes, I see what you mean. First in, first out. Where's my hat? Thank you.
Well, I had concluded that empirically, but it's nice to have some theoretical background.
What? Mena! Come on, quick.
I think I set it on rejuvenation.
It's too late. They've written out the override.
So Brock and Klout are kaput, little Pangol.
Hardin!
Have a baby.
I think we're redundant here. Let's go.
What about it?
Why not? I don't like not knowing where we're going to turn up next.
Some galactic hobo with ideas above his station. The cosmos is full of them. Anyway, there's been enough randomising on this job.
Well then, I'm going to be very glad to get back to work. And I'm missing K9.

Quite an arctic storm blowing out there. Come along, Polly, my child, with my cloak.
Yes, well I'm glad you approve, my child.
Oh now, now, now. Stop being so flippant. We don't know what we're in for outside there. Now come along, come along, come along.
Oh, like toast my dear. Now, did you find everything you want?
All right, well let's go outside and investigate. Go along.
Please stop that. Please, please stop that.
Can you tell us precisely where we are, please?
Doctor.
Why don't you speak up, I'm deaf! (sotto) Who's the CO?
We don't intend you any harm, General, I can assure you of that.
I don't like your tone, sir.
Well, I don't want to depress you both but I'm afraid we're not quite where you think we are.
Well, just take a peek at that.
Yes, I see. A rocket testing site.
Here we are. Well now, excuse me, my dear. Take this to your General please.
Very well, then, take me to the General. I think perhaps I can help him.
Now look here, Sergeant. This is urgent. I insist.
I think I know what you are going to see.
I've written down here what he will see. Now take your hands off me, please.
Well I'm not quite sure, sir. Let me have another look into this instrument.
General, General, yes, it's just as I thought. Come and have a look at these land masses.
Now, doesn't that remind you of anything?
And now, my dear Doctor Barclay, I suggest you look at that piece of paper I gave you.
Certainly.
Yes, sir, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can. You see, millions of years ago there was a twin planet to Earth and
Am I my dear? Yes, I'm afraid I am rather worried.
Well you see, Ben, I know what this planet is and what it means to Earth.
Well, that pretty soon we shall be having visitors.
Oh, quiet, boy, quiet!
May I ask who that was?
Yes, well, I'm afraid all that's going to be rather difficult.
Hot seat?
Well, I think if you allowed us to return where we came from
I can only repeat, sir, what I have already told you. You will get visitors from that other planet.
Yes, they must bring them down.
Because they can't last another orbit.
It's imperative that I talk to you, General.
(to Barclay.) You, will you pay attention? Will you?!
Hey!
Hmm?
Well how can we do that, boy?
Nonsense, nonsense, they'll burn us down in a flash.
No, Ben!
Terrible, terrible.
I'm afraid the spaceship exploded, my dear.
Save us?
Gather energy?!
And how are you going to stop this energy drain from Mondas?
How are we going to survive?!
His age is unimportant here!
You cannot for one moment
Emotions. Love, pride, hate, fear. Have you no emotions, sir?
Why? Why?!
I don't think you should have done that, General. We may have learned a very great deal.
I think you rather underestimate the Cybermen, General.
No need. I'm here.
Yes, yes, yes. Your plan is foiled, sir. You cannot fire the rocket.
I must protest.
Oh, I'm not sure, my dear. Comes from an outside influence. Unless this old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.
Oh, don't worry child, don't worry, don't worry. Oh, let's have a look, dear boy.
It cannot absorb much more energy.
General!
We owe you our lives. That man was going to have us shot.
That is so. We prevented it being fired at you. We helped you. Therefore, I suggest you help us.
Your planet is finished. It will disintegrate. We know why you came here, so why not stay and live with us in peace?
We have no chance. We must play for time. Be quiet. Well, sir, what have you decided?
A moment, please. Are you able to disarm this rocket?
It will give us the time we need.
Yes, now quiet! We accept your terms. The warhead will be removed from the rocket.
You must do as they say.
Let me handle this, my boy!
All of you, go with Barclay.
Go. I think it is wiser.
You give me your word that this young girl will be returned to me when that bomb is safely stowed away?
Very well, child, off you go. And don't forget your coat. I don't want you to get cold.
Didn't you hear?
Hello Geneva, Geneva.
I'm afraid the General isn't here at the moment, and, er, I've been put in charge temporarily.
I have no time to discuss it now, sir.
I do not understand your friend, sir. Evacuate? Surely you're not going to return to Mondas now?
What is your second objective? It's quite obvious, isn't it? The destruction of the Earth! Ben! Barclay! Do not help them.
They're going to use the Zed-bomb to destroy the Earth!
Well, gentlemen, stalemate I think, don't you agree? Well now, what about a little talk?
Oh, quite so, but I'm afraid that won't help save your planet, will it?
You will regret this.
What is it, child?
No, no. Wait. The vibrations. Perhaps it's coming from Mondas.
This spacecraft receives its energy from Mondas. Perhaps it's absorbing too much.
No, I don't know, child. It is an unknown power.
What did you say, my boy? It's all over. It's all over. That's what you said. No, but it isn't all over. It's far from being all over.
I must get back to the Tardis immediately!
Yes, I must go now.
No. No, I must go at once.
Ah, yes. Thank you. It's good. Keep warm.

Please save me from the monsters. Haven't done this in a while.
Making a house call.
Meaning the opposite.
The exact opposite.
Yes, it can. Course it can. Planets and history and stuff. That's what we do. But not today. No. Today, we're answering a cry for help from the scariest place in the universe. A child's bedroom.
That's what we're here to find out.
Exactly. A scared kid. A very scared kid. So scared that somehow its cry for help got through to us in the Tardis.
Exactly. Ah. Going up.
Hello.
Pardon?
Not the bins, no, Miss?
Can I come in?
I could be, but I'm not.
I'm the Doctor.
Three old ladies, a traffic warden from Croatia and a man with ten cats.
Ten cats. Scared kid, remember?
Er, try the next floor down. Catch you later.
Was it?
Yes. Yes.
You've got a problem. I've got a problem. I bet they're connected, I'm the Doctor. Call me Doctor. What can I call you?
Hello, Alex.
So, tell me about George.
Funny's good. We like funny, don't we?
How old is he?
Maybe. It's got worse, though lately?
Pantaphobia.
That's what it's called. Pantaphobia. Not a fear of pants though, if that's what you're thinking. It's a fear of everything. Including pants, I suppose, in that case. Sorry. Go on.
Understandable.
I'll do my best.
I'm the Doctor.
No, George. I just want to talk to you.
About the monsters.
Right.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, you don't want to do that.
Great. Reading's great. You like stories, George? Yeah? Me, too. When I was your age, about, ooo, a thousand years ago, I loved a good bedtime story. The Three Little Sontarans. The Emperor Dalek's New Clothes. Snow White And The Seven Keys To Doomsday, eh? All the classics.
Rubbish. Must be broken. I hate those things. Better tidy it away, though, eh? How about in here? No. Not in the cupboard. Why not in there, George?
And is that where the monsters go? Yeah. There's nothing to be scared of, George. It's just a cupboard.
Screwdriver.
A sonic one. And other stuff.
You may.
Ah, pretty cool, eh?
That's better. No tears from George, that's what I've heard. Go on, give us a smile, there's a brave little soldier. Bit rusty at this. Anyway, let's open this cupboard, eh? There's nothing to be
(sotto) Off the scale. Off the scale. Off the scale. How?
No! No, no, no, no, no. You don't want to do that.
Because George's monsters are real.
No, Alex. Responsible. Very. Cupboard bad. Cupboard not bare. Stay away from cupboard. And there's something else. Something I've missed. Something staring me in the face.
No.
You can't.
I'm not just a professional. I'm the Doctor.
It means I've come a long way to get here, Alex. A very long way. George sent a message. A distress call, if you like. Whatever's inside that cupboard is so terrible, so powerful, that it amplified the fears of an ordinary little boy across all the barriers of time and space.
Through crimson stars and silent stars and tumbling nebulas like oceans set on fire. Through empires of glass and civilizations of pure thought, and a whole, terrible, wonderful universe of impossibilities. You see these eyes? They're old eyes. And one thing I can tell you, Alex. Monsters are real.
First things first. You got any Jammie Dodgers?
What is it with these photos? Anyway. Good. Nice tea. Nothing like a cuppa, but, decision. Should we open the cupboard?
Should we?
Got to open the cupboard, haven't we. Course we have. Come on, Alex. Alex, come on. How else will we ever find out what's going on here?
Monsters. Yeah, well, that's what I do. Breakfast, dinner and tea. Fight the monsters. So this, this is just an average day at the office for me.
Or maybe we shouldn't open the cupboard.
We have no idea what might be in there. How powerful, how evil that thing might be.
Come on, Alex. Alex, come on. Are you crazy? We can't open the cupboard.
Right. That settles it.
Going to open the cupboard.
I don't understand it. It has to be the cupboard. The readings from the sonic screwdriver, they were
How old is George, Alex?
Yes. How old is George?
So you remember when he was born, then?
Course you do. How could you not? You and Claire. Christmas Eve, 2002, right?
Couple of weeks before George was born. Tell me about the day he arrived. Must have been wonderful.
Sure?
You don't sound sure.
What's the matter, Alex?
No, Alex, this is scary. Claire with baby George. Newborn, yes?
Less than a month after Christmas.
So look. Look. Claire's not pregnant.
Not pregnant.
Say that again.
Who are you, George?
George?
George! George, what's going on? Are you doing it?
George, no!
George, no!
George! George, don't do this. We want to help you, George.
More common than you'd think, actually. You're okay.
Obvious, isn't it?
Dolls' house. We're inside the dolls' house.
Yeah, in the cupboard, in your flat. The dolls' house.
Look. Wooden chicken. Cups, saucers, plates, knives, forks, fruit, chickens. Wood. So, we're either inside the dolls' house or this a refuge for dirty posh people who eat wooden food. Or termites. Giant termites trying to get on the property ladder. No. That's possible. Is that possible?
Perception filter. Some kind of hugely powerful perception filter. Convinced you and Claire, everyone. Made you change your memories. Now, what could do that?
So, Claire can't have kids and something responded to that. Responded to that need. What could do that?
Oi! Listen, mush. Old eyes, remember? I've been around the block a few times. More than a few. They've knocked down the blocks I've been round and re-built them as bigger blocks. Super blocks. And I've been round them as well. I can't remember everything.
It's like trying to remember the name of someone you met at a party when you were two.
And I can't just plump for Brian like I normally do.
Shush. What's that?
What?
Now you're getting it.
What do you tell George to do, Alex, with everything that scares him?
Exactly. And George isn't just an ordinary little boy, we know that now, so anything scary he puts in here. Scary toys, like the dolls' house. Scary noises, like, like the lift. Even his little rituals have become part of it. A psychic repository for all his fears, but what is he?
It's not a gun. Wood! I've got to invent a setting for wood. It's embarrassing.
Come on.
Massive psychic field, perfect perception filter, and that need. That need of Claire's to, to. Stupid Doctor. Ow.
George is a Tenza. Of course he is.
A cuckoo. A cuckoo in the nest. A Tenza. He's a Tenza. Millions of them hatch in space and then whoomph, off they drift, looking for a nest. The Tenza young can sense exactly what their foster parents want and then they assimilate perfectly.
Yep.
Of course he is. The child you always wanted. He sensed that instinctively and sought you out, but something scared him. Started this cycle of fear. It's all completely instinctive, subconscious. George isn't even aware that he's controlling it. So we have to make him aware. George!
George, you're the only one who can stop this
But you have to believe. You have to believe. You have to know you're safe.
I can't save you from the monsters.
Only you can. George, listen to me.
George, listen to me.
Rory!
Where's Amy?
Oh, no. George! George, you have to face your fears!
You have to face them now.
You have to open the cupboard, or we'll all be trapped here forever in a living death. George!
George, listen to me. George! George, listen to me. George!
Please! George, you have to end this. End this. End it. End it now!
George. George, you did it. You did it. Hey, it's okay. It's all okay now. Everything's going to be fine.
No! No! No, no, no, no, no. George, you created this whole world. This whole thing. You can smash it. You can destroy it.
Something's holding him back. Something's holding him back. Something.
I'm the Doctor.
That's what did it. That's what the trigger was. He thought you were rejecting him. He thought he wasn't wanted, that someone was going to come and take him away.
Yeah, and he heard you, Alex. A Tenza's sole function is to fit in, to be wanted, and you were rejecting him.
Yes, but George didn't know that. He thought you were rejecting him. He still thinks it.
Not what?
No.
Hello. You're Claire, I expect. Claire, (air kisses) how'd you feel about kippers?
Yeah, we had a great time, didn't we?
See? He's fine.
Yes. Trust me.
Sorry, yes. Bye.
It's sorted. You sorted it. Good man, Alex. Proud of you.
Well, apart from making sure he eats his greens and getting him into a good school, yes.
He's one of the Tenza, remember. He'll adapt perfectly now. Hey! Be whatever you want him to be. I might pop back around puberty, mind you. Always a funny time.
Come on, you two. Things to do, people to see, whole civilisations to save. You feeling okay?
Well, it's good to be all back together again, in the flesh. Come on.
Now, did someone mention something about planets and history and stuff?
Where do you want to go?
Mind's gone blank.
Excuses, excuses.
Or universes. Ooo, three wishes, like Ali Baba. How about that?

Achoo!
You know, this isn't nearly as bad as it looks.
Is the commandant's office painted a sort of green colour with a big flag on the wall?
I think the answer's probably yes.
Howdy.
Ha, ha! It's the Pond.
Hello, Pond. Come here.
Did you see me?
Stalker.
Rory the Roman! Ooo, come here.
I wear a Stetson now. Stetsons are cool.
Er, yes! I've got Easter Island.
Jim the fish.
Still building his dam.
I've been running, faster than I've ever run. And I've been running my whole life. Now, it's time for me to stop. And tonight, I'm going to need you all with me.
A picnic. And then a trip. Somewhere different, somewhere brand new.
Space, 1969.
Salud!
I'm eleven hundred and three. I must've drunk it sometime.
Oh, why it's horrid. I thought it would taste more like the gums.
And you've put on a couple of pounds. I wasn't going to mention it.
Ah, the moon. Look at it. Of course, you lot did a lot more than look, didn't you? Big, silvery thing in the sky. You couldn't resist it. Quite right.
No. A lot more happens in 69 than anyone remembers. Human beings. I thought I'd never get done saving you.
You all need to stay back. Whatever happens now, you do not interfere. Clear?
Hello. It's okay. I know it's you.
Well then.
I'm sorry.
Or hello, as people used to say.
I just popped out to get my special straw. It adds more fizz.
Hey, of course I'm okay. I'm always okay. I'm the King of Okay. Oh, that's a rubbish title. Forget that title. Rory the Roman! That's a good title. Hello, Rory. And Doctor River Song. Oh, you bad, bad girl. What trouble have you got for me this time?
Okay. I'm assuming that's for something I haven't done yet.
Good. Looking forward to it.
I was invited. Date, map reference. Same as you lot, I assume, otherwise it's a hell of a coincidence.
That's a bit personal.
Nine hundred and nine.
Who's Jim the fish?
I don't! What are we all doing here?
Recruited by who?
And who's that?
1969, that's an easy one! Funny, how some years are easy. Now, 1482, full of glitches. Now then, Canton Everett Delaware the third. That was his name, yeah? How many of those can there be? Well, three, I suppose. Rory, is everybody cross with me for some reason?
I'm being extremely clever up here, and there's no one to stand around looking impressed! What's the point in having you all?
Time isn't a straight line. It's all bumpy wumpy. There's loads of boring stuff like Sundays and Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons. But now and then there are Saturdays. Big temporal tipping points when anything's possible. The Tardis can't resist them, like a moth to a flame. She loves a party, so I give her 1969 and NASA, because that's space in the sixties, and Canton Everett Delaware the third, and this is where she's pointing.
Because that's not where we're going.
Home. Well, you two are. Off you pop and make babies. And you, Doctor Song, back to prison. And me? I'm late for a biplane lesson in 1911. Or it could be knitting. Knitting or biplanes. One or the other. What? A mysterious summons. You think I'm just going to go? Who sent those messages? I know you know. I can see it in your faces. Don't play games with me. Don't ever, ever think you're capable of that.
Trust you? Sure. But, first of all, Doctor Song, just one thing. Who are you? You're someone from my future. Getting that. But who? Okay. Why are you in prison? Who did you kill, hmm? Now, I love a bad girl, me, but trust you? Seriously.
Okay.
Are you being threatened? Is someone making you say that?
You're lying.
Swear to me. Swear to me on something that matters.
My life in your hands, Amelia Pond.
So! Canton Everett Delaware the third. Who's he?
Why?
Yeah, 1969. Who's President?
Not enough.
Archaeologist.
Okay, since I don't know what I'm getting into this time, for once I'm being discreet. I'm putting the engines on silent.
Did you do something?
Putting the outer shield on invisible. I haven't done this in a while. Big drain on the power.
Ha!
Er, did you touch something?
Good. You might learn something. Okay. Now I can't check the scanner. It doesn't work when we're cloaked. Just give us a mo. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. You lot, wait a moment. We're in the middle of the most powerful city in the most powerful country on Earth. Let's take it slow.
Oh. Hello. Bad moment. Oh look, this is the Oval Office. I was looking for the er, oblong room. I'll just be off, then, shall I?
Don't worry! It always does that when its cloaked.
Ah, no. Stop that.
Stop that! Argh! Oh!
River, have you got my scanner
Working yet?
No, you don't!
River, make her blue again!
Mister President, that child just told you everything you need to know, but you weren't listening. Never mind, though, because the answer's yes. I'll take the case. Fellows, the guns, really? I just walked into the highest security office in the United States and parked a big blue box on the rug. Do you think you can just shoot me?
Don't shoot. Definitely no shooting.
It's a police box. Can't you read? I'm your new undercover agent on loan from Scotland Yard. Code name the Doctor. These are my top operatives, the Legs, the Nose, and Mrs Robinson.
No, you don't.
Nah, boring question. Who's phoning you? That's interesting. Because Canton Three is right. That was definitely a girl's voice, which means there's only one place in America she can be phoning from.
Clever, eh?
Five.
Thanks, Canton.
Not so thanks.
I'm going to need a SWAT team, ready to mobilise. Street level maps covering all of Florida. A pot of coffee, twelve Jammie Dodgers and a fez.
There's where NASA is. She mentioned a spaceman. NASA's where the spacemen live. Also, there's another lead I'm following.
Are you all right?
DOCTOR; Yeah, and where's my fez?
Here! The only place in the United States that call could be coming from. See? Obvious, when you think about it.
It's a hobby.
There's no time for a SWAT team. Let's go. Mister President, tell her help's on the way. Canton, on no account follow me into this box and close the door behind you.
Jefferson isn't a girl's name. It's not her name either. Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton. River.
Lovely fellows. Two of them fancied me.
You see, the President asked the child two questions. Where are you and who are you? She was answering where.
Now, where would you find three big, historical names in a row like that?
Here. Come on.
Are you taking care of this?
About five miles from Cape Kennedy Space Centre. It's 1969, the year of the moon. Interesting, don't you think?
I don't know. Lost me a bit. The President asked the girl where she was, and she did what any lost little girl would do. She looked out of the window.
The only place in Florida, probably all of America, with those three street names on the same junction. And Doctor Song, you've got that face on again.
The he's hot when he's clever face.
Yes, it is.
Not a chance.
You haven't even got to space travel yet?
Brave heart, Canton. Come on.
You realise this is almost certainly a trap, of course?
Let's see if anyone tries to kill us and work backwards.
I don't know. Let's find her and ask her.
Which is odd, because look at this!
It's very contemporary. Cutting edge. This is from the space program.
Apparently.
Maybe because it's cooler? Look how cool this stuff is.
Well, what would you call me?
Oi!
Ah! Back with us, Canton.
That's my boy. So, come on. Little girl. Let's find her.
So where does that go?
Life signs?
Those are the worst kind.
Be careful.
Shout if you get in trouble.
Er, nothing. She's just a friend.
Okay.
Stupidly dangerous!
Rory, would you mind going with her?
Then I'd appreciate it all the more.
Amy?
What's wrong?
What, now?
Canton! Canton, are you okay?
Just unconscious. Got a proper whack.
Not a great moment.
What are you doing?
No!

Does this look like Brighton?
It's not even Hove. It could be Worthing.
Oh, not really, not failed. We're on the right planet, in the right time, roughly in the right general direction, assuming this is Worthing.
Because the localised condition of planetary atmospheric condensation caused a malfunction in the visual orientation circuits. Or to put it another way, we got lost in the fog. Never mind. Easy enough to pop back in and try again. That's odd.
A lighthouse without a light.
Oh, good. We'll just knock on the door, get directions and we'll be on our way.
Foghorn.
I said it's a foghorn! It warns the ships off these rocks. Mightn't spot the light in this fog. You know what ships are. We saw some on the Thames, remember?
Keeper?
The generator's working. I wonder what's happening to the power?
It could be shorting out, I suppose.
What, without asking permission? I wouldn't dream of it. Let's talk to the crew first. This way. Teshnician?
Anyone at home?
No, it isn't.
I'm the Doctor. How do you do. You seem to be having some trouble here.
We're mislaid mariners. Our craft's parked on the other side of the island.
Yes.
Good.
Worthing.
Yes.
Well, small in some ways.
What's the trouble here?
Tricky things, the early generators.
Ben? Who's Ben?
Just the two of you, are there?
Yes, I know the type. In the early days of oil, he'd have said there's nothing like a really large candle, eh?
Where's Ben now?
Ben. Why isn't he working on the generator?
No. No, I didn't.
No, that's all right, that's all right. What's your name?
I'll go, Mister Hawkins. I'm something of an engineer myself. I might be able to help. You look after the young lady.
Ben?
Ben? Ben! No Ben.
Curiouser and curiouser.
I'm over here.
Yes, I always find trouble.
I doubt it.
He's over there, dead. He's been dead some little time.
As far as I can tell, a massive electric shock. He died instantly.
Vince, you'd better go and tell old Reuben what's happened. Go on.
I thought there might have been something nasty in the coal hole. There's something nasty somewhere.
What, that can open and shut doors and doesn't so much as leave a wet footprint, and has the ability to drain off electricity?
That's Ben's lantern.
This is very interesting, Leela. It's called a Marconi Wireless Telegraph. You can send messages a long way with this.
Sorry. Shouldn't you be using it to report Ben's death?
No.
You do know how to operate it?
Was the expert.
Oh, very likely.
Reuben, do you think we had something to do with your friend's death?
Incontrovertible.
What are you going to do, clap us in irons?
Reuben, we're only trying to help.
Stubborn old mule.
I don't know.
I don't fancy playing tag in the fog with something that can do that. I think I'll go and have a word with Vince.
A fireball? A fireball?
What time was that?
How far away?
Yes. Yes, I noticed the cold. You're a good lad, Vince.
Of course, on Pharos they had slaves to keep the bonfires going.
Oh yes, and I'll tell you something else now. On Gallifrey
Yes, Galli.
Oh no, not a bit of it. Don't mind me.
Reuben, there's a light out there.
There's a light out there.
And going fast.
(to Leela) Keep that siren going.
No, I don't suppose it would. It seems to need electricity.
What was it like?
Luminous. Do you think you could show me the spot?
When I find out, I'll let you know.
The Beast of Fang Rock.
Where's Harker, your coxswain?
I'll wait.
Good.
And whose seamanship was it got you on the rocks?
No, but I'm full of ideas.
Yes, of course, Vince. Off you go. Leela?
You'd better go with him.
Yes.
One of the keepers was electrocuted earlier this evening, and since then Vince doesn't like going down there.
Just a moment! We haven't been introduced.
Where were you heading?
When your yacht struck?
What about the rest of the crew? Were any other boats launched?
Ah, you want to get to London?
You've no chance in this fog.
It's all right, Leela, he's a friend, aren't you, Harker.
It's all that's left of Ben. Where did you find him, Harker?
It wasn't the sea that did that.
There's some hot soup in the crew room, Harker.
The others are already there.
Quick, get that door closed.
What beast?
There's no such animal.
Leela, the people round here have been fisher folk for generations. They're almost as primitive and as superstition-ridden as your lot are.
Post-mortem.
Something wants to make a detailed study of human anatomy.
Quick, get it out.
Yes, I'm here, Vince.
Obviously I was wrong. The shock simply stunned him, he partly recovered, staggered out onto the rocks, fell into the sea and was drowned. You get on about your work, Vince. There's nothing supernatural going on round here.
Electricity has strange effects, Vince.
Hmm.
That's all right, Vince.
Because I don't know what the truth is, yet.
The inquiry's already begun. Move over.
Just you stay here, all of you. Harker, you try and get some rest.
What? A strong electrical field. Strong enough to kill a man on contact. Interesting. Probably explains the phosphorescent glow. And fish at a distance of several yards.
I don't know what it is, Leela. I think it's desperate and I think it's cunning, and I think it's time we were getting back.
I do. I think he was taking Ben's body away for examination when you saw it.
Under the sea. Earlier tonight Vince saw what he called a fireball fall into the sea not far away.
Not another Tardis. A spaceship, perhaps. Yes, an alien creature which has never before encountered human beings might just behave that way.
There's electricity. Perhaps that's what attracted it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Just a minute. It's behaviour pattern is furtive.
That means it keeps out of sight while it spies out the land, hoping to mount a successful attack.
No, but cunning. I don't think this fog's a freak of the weather.
I think it's been contrived to isolate us. That creature, or whatever it is, will be getting bolder by now. It's seen this primitive technology, it's had time to calculate the physical strength of its enemies. I think we're in terrible trouble.
What about the others? They'll think we're mad if we start talking about creatures from outer space.
Shush. Don't tell them that, whatever you do. What do you mean, do not be afraid.
Let go, Harker!
Come on, sit down. Sit down. All that can wait. Gentlemen, I've got news for you. This lighthouse is under attack, and by morning we might all be dead. Anyone interested?
Understand this. No one, but no one, is to leave this lighthouse for any reason. Is that clear?
You heard what she said.
Are you sure?
I believe you're right.
Leela's senses are particularly acute, and if she says it's getting colder, it's getting colder!
Reuben?
Don't talk to any strangers.
Well, there's nothing out there now. Were you calling?
Get that door shut. Do you know what I think?
Probably, probably.
This electrical
Got it! U by Q over R.
Shush.
Thinking.
Yes, it's certainly been here. You see, in the space surrounding an electrically charged body there occurs an electric potential which is proportional to the charge Q, and inversely proportional to the distance R from the centre. Where is he?
Reuben. I thought you said you'd seen him.
Then why didn't you tell me?
Why am I standing here wasting my time trying to work out its size?
If Reuben's seen it, he can tell us.
Come on, savage. Harker?
Try and find some way to secure that door, hmm?
Where's Reuben?
Groggy?
Thank you very much. Come on, Leela.
Reuben? Reuben, are you in there?
Can you hear me?
Reuben, open the door. I want to talk to you.
Solid oak.
Because he's not listening.
Shock can close the mind, Leela. He could be like that for hours. Days, even.
Someone's got to keep this place running. Go and tell Harker to stay where he is and keep the boiler pressure up.
Vince?
Vince!
You all right?
Good. I want to talk to you, Vince.
I don't know, Vince, but I think we'll find out by sunrise.
That's superstitious nonsense, Vince.
There are eight of us here. If it attacks again, we'll be ready and waiting. All the advantage is with us. Eight to one.
So then, Harker keeps the boiler stoked, and you stay on the siren.
I do.
No, no, no. You stay here, Vince. Do what you've got to do.
Stay here, Vince.
He'll come out when he's ready.
No. There's no one in the lamp room except the keeper. Go back to the crew room.
Get back to the crew room!
The Malicious Damage Act 1861 covers lighthouses.
Nothing.
Leela, get Harker up here, then try and find Palmerdale.
Yes.
Shush.
Survival, Colonel.
Yes. Yours, mine, all of us.
Do you find that difficult to accept, Colonel?
Quite so, quite so, and I don't believe in mythical sea creatures either.
Because somewhere out there is a hostile alien from a distant planet, and I believe it intends to destroy us.
Yes.
I've never been more serious, Colonel. We are facing an enemy of greater power than you can dream of.
Herbert may have a few unimportant facts wrong, but his basic supposition is sound enough.
You think your little speck in the galaxy's the only one with intelligent life, hmm? Yes? (listens) How very interesting.
That was Vince.
He says he thinks Lord Palmerdale's fallen from the lamp gallery.
I agree. The question is, do we go out and see?
I do. Leela, stay here. Come on.
Harker, secure the door. Come with me, Skinsale.
And what was he up to?
Ah. And so you came down here and wrecked the telegraph.
Of course. So to protect your honour, you've put all our lives in danger.
Oh, no. We're on our own now.
Murdered him? I wish you had.
Well, if you had murdered Palmerdale, everything would have been so much simpler. Unfortunately, he was dead before he hit the ground.
Electrocuted. He was killed by a massive electric shock, in exactly the same way the keeper was.
Oh, not only can it climb sheer walls, it's amphibious, it has some affinity with electricity and the technological ability to adapt its environment to optimum thermal levels. Are you following me?
It likes the cold.
Not enough data to place the species.
But heat might be a method of defence.
Harker.
Get her out of here!
Yes.
Rigor mortis.
He's been dead for hours.
Not Reuben.
The chameleon factor, sometimes called lycanthropy. Leela, I've made a terrible mistake. I thought I'd locked the enemy out. Instead, I've locked it in, with us.
It has. But it needed to study the human life pattern first.
Organic restructuring is elementary physiology for Time Lords.
What?
No, not a Time Lord. Elementary physiology for us is something that lesser species might master after a few thousand centuries.
We don't?
Yes, but it took Reuben's form for a reason.
What is it?
No, no, no, no. We can't. If we got within touching distance of it, we're dead. It packs too many volts.
It's some kind of power relay.
Yes, yes. Rule one after surviving a crash landing, set up distress beacon. To do that it would have needed a power source. That's why it came here. There must be a signal modulator somewhere, transmitting. To whom? To it's own kind. Leela, get the surviving humans to the lamp room.
Yes, that's the easiest place to defend.
I'll do the looking. Hurry, there isn't much time.
Where's Leela?
Shush. Now listen. When you reach the service room, you'll find a locker full of maroons. I want you to break them open and scatter the powder down the lamp room stairs. Vince'll help you. Off you go.
May I help you? Having trouble, Reuben, hmm? Not easy holding a human form stable, is it.
Good idea. You'll find it a lot comfier.
Now I remember. Reuben the Rutan.
Well, when you've seen one Rutan, you've seen them all.
Well, I expect you'll get better at it in time. What are you doing in this part of the galaxy anyway?
Got it! You're at last losing that interminable war with the Sontarans.
Is it? You used to control the whole of the Mutter's Spiral once. Now the Sontarans have driven you to the far fringes of the galaxy.
Rutan, that's the empty rhetoric of a defeated dictator, and I don't like your face, either.
Why invade an obscure planet like Earth? It's of no value to you.
But if you set up a power base here, the Sontarans will bombard it with photonic missiles.
And what about its people?
I can understand your military purposes, but why murder a hatful of harmless humans?
But you crashed, didn't you, just as you made your discovery. You failed.
You're not, you know.
I'm sorry to disappoint you. I fixed that as well, oyster face.
You can't be certain.
But by then, you'll be dead.
Well, if you'll just step this way, I'll show you.
I've brought someone to see you. Give me one of those fuses, quickly.
Probably not, but we've no choice. I'm so sorry to bother you. Could you oblige me with a light?
A match.
Thank you. Move over.
Oh, a little militant chit-chat.
What kept you?
Correct.
Unlikely.
It's an intelligent, highly aggressive species from Ruta Three.
It evolved in the sea, adapted to land. Any more gunpowder, Colonel?
Well, Ruta Three is an icy planet. Its inhabitants find heat intensely painful. Now, if we had a flame-thrower.
What?
It's an early Schermuly.
Yes, an early Schermuly. A Schermuly box that fires a rocket and line.
Yes. It won't do, though. Stay calm, Skinsale.
Here, take this.
Loaded with a few odds and ends it should cover the stairs. Empty your pockets, and mine.
Of course, it's not just this Rutan I'm worried about, it's the others.
Yes.
There's a whole battle fleet out there. By the time the Rutans and the Sontarans
Yes. By the time they've finished with it, this planet'll be like a cinder hanging in space.
Yes. Unless, of course, we could knock out both the mother ship and the scout ship. If we could do that, they just might conclude that this section of space was too dangerous.
I don't know. We've nothing here that would stop a Rutan spaceship in its tracks. Rutan ships have a crystalline infrastructure, you see. Shielded, of course. Still, landing on a planet like this, they might just cut off the energy fields to save power. No, I'd need an amplified carbon oscillator.
It's like a laser beam but much more destructive.
Yes.
Well, yes, put in it's simplest terms.
What?
That? Are you suggesting I convert the carbon arc beam?
Leela, that's a beautiful notion. Unfortunately I'd need a focusing device, a fairly large piece of crystalline carbon.
Yes.
No, that's too small. I'd need a much bigger one for the primary beam oscillator.
What?
He did?
The crew room.
Yes. Yes. Well, let's get this working first.
Are you sure you've got it?
Good.
That's not necessary.
All right. Remember, Leela, don't fire until you see the green of its tentacles.
With discretion. Come on, Colonel.
(sotto) Hurry. Hurry!
(sotto) Body belt. Body belt!
Ready, Leela?
Now!
You singed my scarf.
Dead with honour.
Yes.
Leela? Leela!
Been celebrating, have you?
Not in my opinion. I haven't got time to discuss morality. Look out there.
It is. When it gets within range, this will lock onto its carbon resonator and knock out its anti-grav, I hope. We've got about a hundred and seventeen seconds to get out of here. Understand?
Good. So when I switch on, you run for it, all right?
Come on. Whatever you do, don't look back. I said don't look back! Let's go. Now!
Leela, come on!
Leela!
Leela!
That'll teach them.
I thought I told you not to look back.
What?
You're neither old nor crippled. The effects of the flash will pass.
Mmm. Blink. That's interesting.
Pigmentation dispersal caused by the flash. Your eyes have changed colour. Leela, stop blinking now. Let's go.
Blue. 'Aye, though we hunted high and low, and hunted everywhere.'

Wilfred Gibson. 'Aye, though we hunted high and low, and hunted everywhere, of the three men's fate we found no trace'
'In any time, in any place. But a door ajar and an untouched needle and an over-toppled chair.'

Is there anything on my head?
Describe it.
Antlers?
Antlers! Hmm.
You are a time-space machine. You're a vehicle! I've never asked you to cheer me up with hologrammatic antlers!
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Close enough. Why?
I don't know.
Will there be singing?
Fine, then.
Sorry?
I'm never sure. I don't like being sure about things. One minute you're sure, the next everybody turns into lizards and a piano falls on you.
It's been a long day.
So what's the medical emergency?
What?
That's what? Oh, the flying saucer. Is that new?
Hello.
Well, that's an ongoing problem for me.
I've had a haircut. This is my best suit.
Do I know you?
River!
Well, it's a tiny bit complicated. People usually need a flowchart.
Which alphabet? (grin fades) Sorry, you really didn't want these questions, did you?
What seems to be the problem?
Your husband?
I think I'm going to need a bigger flowchart.
No, wait. That's your husband?
No, wait.
Yes, that's who you're married to? Not anybody else?
Right. So you don't recognise
Oh, no reason.
I don't like him. Do you like him?
He's a lying down person. I don't like lying down people. It's so untidy.
Oh, oh.
Because they cross, I've got cross arms.
(sotto) This might be an alarming question in the circumstance, but you really do think I'm a surgeon, don't you?
(sotto) Okay, calm down, keep it together. Don't make puddles.
(sotto) Any tiny hint of species he might be?
(sotto) Okay, never mind. You just stay there. (to a monk next to them.) You're probably going to need a mop.
Sorry, what?
Oh, no. I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I can't do that.
It's my back.
Yeah, my back's playing up. It simply refuses to carry the weight of an entirely pointless stratum of society who contribute nothing of worth to the world and crush the hopes and dreams of working people.
Well, that depends upon what's wrong with you.
You could have fooled me.
Oh, oh, sorry.
Sorry, just gallows humour. Probably the wrong word.
All right, enough of this. The joke's over.
Look at me.
I'm the Doctor.
It's not a bullet.
How did it get in there?
No!
The Halassi Androvar.
It's very small. It might be difficult to manoeuvre it.
His head?
Wouldn't that kill him?
Your husband?
Sort of?
Why?
Slash murderer slash thief.
Is this what you're like when I'm not
You're talking about murdering someone.
I need more information.
For my diagnosis.
I'll be the judge of that. I'm the Doctor.
Yes, probably a chap with a big
You married a cyborg and you didn't even know it.
Do not harm her! If you know what's good for you, do not lay a finger on that woman.
Garbage disposal, right? Get ready to say whee!
Back off from River Song. Give the order now. Get yourself under control.
Do you really have a shooty trowel?
Sonic trowel. You realise how ridiculous that sounds?
Look at that, your body's got a mind of its own.
Plus in-built flash drive and vernacular friendly interface.
Mobile life support.
It's not sexy.
Why is everything sexy now?
Sorry?
Stop shouting a minute if you want to go face-up.
We're being threatened by a bag! By a head in a bag!
I can't approve of any of this, you know, but I haven't laughed in a long time.
You know, don't you?
Stop pretending. You know who I am.
You know who I am. It's, it's, it's me.
Urgh! Doesn't it get dull after a while? As an activity, it's not hugely varied, is it?
Another one? Are you going to kill him, too?
Who's Damsel?
Damsel.
What if he has a face that you don't know about yet?
Off-world. People never say that. (laughs) Are you new?
Yes, he's probably off rebuilding a civilisation or defeating giant robot fish
From the ninth dimension. Sorry, what?
I'm sorry. The word steal. Somebody said steal.
You can't.
You can't just steal a Ta. A box.
Look, it says Police.
Okay. This er Damsel person. He sounds, he sounds pretty dangerous. Ish.
Yes, he will.
He'll just know.
Maybe he'll notice now.
Finally.
It's my go.
Oh. My, God! Oh, it's bigger!
On the inside,
Than it is
On the outside!
My entire understanding of physical space has been transformed! Three-dimensional Euclidean geometry has been torn up, thrown in the air and snogged to death! My grasp of the universal constants of physical reality has been changed forever.
Sorry. I've always wanted to see that done properly.
It seems to have powered down, conserving batteries. It's an in-built life-support system. I'm not sure what powers it, but
I don't know. A signal? Distress call?
Possibly.
He must be very cross. He's lost his head.
You're doing it wrong.
Not those levers.
You probably want to press that button.
Does it?
Better avoid deck seven then.
Maybe.
Maybe the engines are interfering with themselves. Wild theory, but what if this machine had certain safeguards. For instance, maybe it
Which would mean, and again, I'm just, I'm just wildly theorising here, that's the door would not engage properly.
Hence it can't take off. Not when someone is in and out at the same time. I mean, that just wouldn't be good manners, would it?
Yes. For a Doctor.
Seriously?
It's signalling. We have to assume the body is homing in on this.
Well, we could chop its head off. Oh, look.
Wouldn't it be a great universe if it did?
Yep.
You can't shoot the head in the face!
Go on, then, tell him to put his hands up.
Why, what are you going to do?
Burn what?
A perpetually stabilised black hole. That's your power source.
A really good one for doctors.
So you could wipe out this solar system.
So, why haven't you threatened this before?
You're endangering them now.
Put her down.
Where are we going?
You set the coordinates. Where for?
Where are we?
What about the box? Stop holding my hand, people don't do that to me.
Don't hush me. I'm not a hushing person.
Yes, he is.
No, you won't.
Sorry. It was my stomach. I have an irritable bowel.
It's having a day.
Two hundred?
So, what's the occasion?
I thought you were returning it to the Halassi?
Where did you find a buyer?
How did you know?
Deadlock seals can be broken.
You married him, though.
How?
To fall in love?
River, there's er, there's something I should probably tell you.
What's the book?
Is it sad?
I don't know. It's just that you look sad.
So?
He sounds awful.
Not somebody special then?
So, who is this buyer?
Who wants to know?
And could you either sit down or fetch us the wine list or something?
Just a thought, you probably shouldn't do that in a restaurant.
Block booking. That's clever.
Er, well, er. Awkward.
Yes, you will. Of, by jingo, you will, yes, of course. But obviously, we have to, you know, er, check some
Things. There are things that have to be checked before I get it to you. If we don't check the thing, then the, the
Yes, you will receive, and here it is. Now, on its way, over this small distance.
Here you go. And you can have the bag as well.
Well, it's going to be a funny old day. Oh, boy.
You know what? I just can't stand idly by and let this continue.
Death has been done this day! Noble blood has been spilled, and our tears will surely follow. The sky shall crack, the ground shall heave, and even the rocks and the stones shall weep their rage. Behold! The head of Hydroflax!
Rest now, sweet prince. Walk amongst us nevermore. Shall we start the bidding at two hundred billion? I'm sorry, Professor Song, but we really couldn't keep this treasure from the truly devout.
And shall we find out who is the most truly devout?
Two hundred fifty million by the sweet trolley.
Well, it doesn't say much for your king if you can't put a price on his head. Let us see what the king himself has to say.
River
River.
River
(sotto) Hello, sweetie.
What, the roots of the sunset?
I'll have to check with the stars themselves.
We need to get to work.
Four exits. Two concealed, one in the ceiling.
No, I don't like it.
A bit too tight.
Exactly here, I should think.
Your escape plan.
What do you think, by the way?
My new body.
A thing happened.
The diamond?
I'm not sure good's the word.
We need to get this ship stabilised. Where's the bridge?
We also need to stop that.
I'll take the robot, you drive.
Oh, don't stop for strangers.
What's the point? It's over.
What for? We're on a crashing spaceship and I don't even know if I can save it. You just shot your own king in your own face. You'd get beheaded if you had one.
Do you know what you need? Do you know what any decent headless king needs? Money. This connects every bank to every other bank in this galaxy. Right here in my hand, all the money you can eat.
With pleasure.
Welcome to all the best firewalls in the galaxy. Nothing is protected like money. Every stock market within a light year is arguing in your head.
Ha ha! That's the way it is for most people.
He had a bad day on the market.
Sorry, I appreciate that wasn't very funny, but I couldn't help saying it.
Where's everyone else?
We need to get the navcom back online. And re-route the thrusters.
So, King Hydroflax?
So you say.
Ramone.
Stephen Fry.
Same thing.
Well, that's nice. Maybe they'll name the crater after us.
Always good to know where we're going. Could you concentrate on your work, please?
Yes, I'll be sure to give them a wave as we zoom past.
I'd quite like to cancel this time too, if at all possible.
Yes. I can use the power cell to boost the thrusters.
Hold this, quickly.
Sorry, River. Crashing spaceships, that's my job.
More power. You can do it, you can do it.
No, River, no, no, no, no!
Get back in the Tardis! This is my job!
I've been doing it longer.
River, not one person on this ship, not one living thing, is worth you.
Yeah, sort of.
Yeah, good idea.
Indestructible as ever.
Married the diamond.
Yes, I did.
I doubt if you'd find any. And I don't think any of them would be worth it, if that's a comfort. Brave of you to try, though. Well done.
Those are the Singing Towers, aren't they?
The Singing Towers of Darillium. Here we are at last.
You know what? They should build a restaurant right here, with a view of those towers. You could make a lot of money that way. You should do that.
The Halassi Androvar. I think you'll find that the reward is pretty substantial.
(sotto) Restaurant!
Excuse me, um, I'd like a table on the balcony with a view of the towers.
Not a problem.
Down, girl.
Happy Christmas.
When I saw the sonic trowel, I thought it was just embarrassing, but, look.
You look, er, amazing.
Well, you've moved your hair about, haven't you?
So what do you think? The Singing Towers.
No. Just the wind.
No? It blows through the cave system and harmonises with the crystal layer.
Why are
Please don't.
Oh, I dread to think.
You really shouldn't do that.
Spoilers.
River, stop.
Don't.
Not everything can be avoided. Not forever.
Every night is the last night for something. Every Christmas is the last Christmas
No, I don't. Not always. Times end, River, because they have to. Because there's no such thing as happy ever after. It's just a lie we tell ourselves because the truth is so hard.
Mmm. What do you think of the towers?
Then why are you ignoring them?
No, you can't. They've been there for millions of years, through storms and floods and wars and time. Nobody really understands where the music comes from. It's probably something to do with the precise positions, the distance between both towers. Even the locals aren't sure. All anyone will ever tell you is that when the wind stands fair and the night is perfect, when you least expect it but always when you need it the most there is a song.
I didn't say that.
Twenty four years.
No, you don't.

I bring proof of courage and comradeship. What is this ship and why are you here? Identify yourselves by species and planet of origin.
Handles?
Handles? Argh. Handles?
Every ship I go on, they just shoot at me. Handles, I said, put me on a ship. I didn't say, put me on a Dalek ship.
Don't put me on a Dalek ship when I'm holding a broken bit of Dalek!
Ow!
Use your head.
It's not like you've got a lot of alternatives. They're all here. Daleks, Sontarans, Terileptils, Slitheen. And they're not even fighting, they're just parked. Why?
Yes, yes, the message, the message. Even I can't translate it. I mean, why is everyone here if they don't understand it?
Well, you know, I'm OCD. What's their excuse? What does this message mean?
Oh, no. And remind me I've got to patch the telephone back through the console unit. This is getting ridiculous.
Okay?
No, no. No, no, no, no. No, not now. Remind me later.
I don't know. Just later. Just pick a time.
I don't know. Just any old time. When you think I've forgotten.
Just pick a random number, express that number as a quantity of minutes, and when that time has elapsed, remind me to patch the telephone back through the console unit.
How those Cyber-evenings must fly.
Hello, the Tardis.
Ding dong. Okay, brilliant. I may be a bit rusty in some areas, but I will glance at a manual.
Oh, that was quick. It's a roller coaster this phone call.
Well, I hope you're nicer to the next one.
So?
Yeah, I did that once and there's no easy way to get rid of an android.
Yeah.
Handles, that's a new ship. Okay, we'll take the Tardis this time.
Sorry, missed that last bit. Got to dash.
Okay, don't be alarmed, I come in
Peace. No.
Argh! Sorry.
I'm being shot at by Cybermen!
Argh! Yeah, why not?
Clara!
Why? What is it? What's wrong?
Yes, I am naked. I wondered if you'd notice.
Because I'm going to church.
Better?
Hologram clothes, projected directly onto your visual cortex.
Everybody's naked underneath.
Hello, the Oswalds. Hello! Merry Christmas. Hello, hello.
Hello, handsome. Anyone for Twister?
Excuse me a moment. Listen, I've got an idea to break the ice. Why don't I project my clothes hologram onto their visual cortexes too?
Yes, and I'm starting to think it may be causing tension.
Eh? Sorry.
Oh, that's never going to work, is it?
I think a decent vet would give it an even chance.
An app?
Most certainly not. It doesn't do turkey. Nothing does turkey. You'd need a time machine. What?
You can't keep using the Tardis like this.
Missed birthdays, restaurant bookings. And please, just learn how to use iPlayer.
Yep, exposure to the time winds. It'll either come up a treat, or just possibly lay some eggs.
Oh, just a bit of a Cyberman. He'll get us to the church on time.
The organics are all gone, but there's still a full set of data banks. Found it at the Maldovar market.
Right, cool. Go on then. Okay, tell us, what is the planet? Go on.
Okay, in your own time, dear. Don't rush.
It's shielded. Even the Tardis can't break through it.
What did you say?
What are you talking about? Gallifrey? What do you mean?
You see that? Gallifrey is my home. I know it when I see it. That is not Gallifrey.
It's not Gallifrey. Gallifrey is gone.
Even if it survived, it's gone from this universe. That is not my home.
It can't be.
Papal Mainframe. It's like a great big flying church. The first ship to arrive. They are the ones who shielded the planet. They can get us down there.
Tasha Lem, the Mother Superious.
Oh, she's inviting us aboard.
Because I asked her. Swallow this.
Your hologram projector. You can't go to church with your clothes on.
I know. Relaxing, isn't it?
The Church of the Papal Mainframe, security hub of the known universe.
Yep. Keeping you safe in this world and the next. I venerate the exaltation of the Mother Superious.
Loving the frock.
Tash, this old thing? Please, I've been rocking it for centuries.
Clara, this is Tasha Lem, the Head of the Church of the Papal Mainframe. Tash, ho, ho, ho, ho. This is my, my associate, Clara Oswald. Miss Clara Oswald.
It was Tasha who shielded the planet. But you could sneak me down there, couldn't you, Tash?
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Clara. Well, quite a lot of it. Probably about half. Maybe a smidge under. Actually, Clara, would you mind waiting out here, please?
Yes, quite. No, stop it.
Well.
That altar looks like a bed.
Yep.
Feel?
What?
Right. What's the signal? Where's it coming from?
Right. Anyone been for a look?
Daleks, Cybermen, one of that lot, could break through your defences.
I do.
Are you okay?
When do I? Don't answer that.
What?
What can I do with a key? You, in, now.
The Tardis doesn't work by remote. Fine. If it makes you feel any better, there we are.
Okay, don't worry. There's a heat loss filter in your hologram shell. It'll kick in, just give it a moment. So, sweet little town covered in snow, half the universe in terror. Why? Why?
What?
What is it?
Okay, just stand back please, Clara.
Clara, step away from it!
Clara, keep looking at it. Don't look away. Don't even blink!
There is a Weeping Angel under the snow. It looks like a statue, isn't a statue. Can you get your foot out?
You're not wearing a shoe.
Okay, pull hard. One, two, three!
Keep looking at the. At all of them.
Quantum locked lifeform. It can only move if it's unobserved.
Same as everybody else. Must've got past Tasha's shield.
Keep looking!
I just need to bring the Tardis down.
No, but it can home in on the key.
She took one of them.
The old key in the quiff routine. Classic.
Okay, homing in on the mysterious message. Ooo yes, I like that. The mysterious message.
Yep. Clever plan to get us past the shield.
Yeah, tiny bit bored.
No, they're just delicate. Right, setting us down near the signal source. I'm going to turn the engines on silent. Don't want to make a fuss.
Why?
I know.
Now, what do we make of this place? It's two o'clock in the afternoon. Must be very short days here. The message is coming from that tower.
Hello! Hello, there. Right, we're a couple from the next town. My name's probably Hank or Rock, something like that.
Shut up. Hello, good to meet you. Nice snow.
I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. I stole a time machine and ran away and I've been flouting the principal law of my own people every since. That wasn't quite what I was meant to say!
Used to what?
I'm wearing a wig! No, ah, I see. Yes, of course. It's a truth field. Oh, that is so quaint. I haven't seen a truth field in years. I'm wearing a wig.
Doesn't that make life a bit difficult?
This town, what's it called?
It's July.
I don't know. How can an island be called Easter? Maybe it's just nice here. I almost hate to find out what's wrong.
There you are. What took you so long?
I knew. I always knew it wasn't over.
A split in the skin of reality.
A tiny sliver of the 26th of June, 2010. The day the universe blew up.
I rebooted it, put it all back together.
Well, it was my Tardis that blew it up in the first place. I felt a degree of responsibility. But the scar tissue remains. A structural weakness in the whole universe. Whoa! And someone's trying to get through it from outside our universe, from somewhere else. Of course. Of course. It makes sense.
Yes. If you were trying to break through a wall, you'd choose the weakest spot. If you were trying to break into this universe, you'd choose this crack, because. No. If you were trying to break back into this universe. (to Handles) You said Gallifrey. Why did you say Gallifrey?
No. I said it was in another universe. The message is coming through here. The truth field is too, at a guess. If it's the Time Lords. If it's the Time Lords.
Seal of the High Council of Gallifrey. Nicked it off the Master in the Death Zone. (Five Doctors) There is an algorithm imprinted in the atomic structure. Use it to decode the message.
It's a question. Why can't you just say it's a question?
The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.
A question only I could answer. A truth field to make sure I'm not lying. If I give my name, they'll know they've found the right place and that it's safe to come through.
Er, you need to take this to the Tardis and put it in the charger slot for the sonic.
Hell. All hell, that's what happens if the Time Lords come back. There's half a universe up there already, waiting to open fire. Now please, go to the Tardis and just do as I say.
Mother Superious, there is only one thing I need from you. This planet, what's it called?
If they return, they will come in peace.
They're asking for my help!
No, this planet is protected.
So, you lot, a quick word, thank you. Spot of news. Christmas has a new sheriff. Hello, everyone. I'm the Doctor.
There you go, Barnable.
Working fine. Nice action. Don't leave it out in the rain again.
Fixed the wheels and the antigrav.
Yeah, may have gone a bit far. Now then, what do we have today? Don't you move one step further. Wooden Cyberman. Nice. Like it.
Low tech, doesn't set off the alarms upstairs.
Only bit of tech allowed in. Got in before the truce. Now, I just sent an instruction to your firearm to reverse the polarity and fire out the back end. Now, as we're standing in a truth field, you will understand I cannot be lying. If you like, you can scan my screwdriver, verify that's the signal I sent.
Yes. I probably should have mentioned this doesn't work on wood. You send your friends up there a message from the Doctor. You tell them the Doctor stays.
Next.
And there's me arm-wrestling a Draconian. I remember that.
Christmas is defended.
You've got to be the drunk giraffe. You've got to commit! Don't be cool, guys. Cool is not cool.
And what's the dance we're doing?
The drunk giraffe. Yeah, it is. Merry Christmas. Give me a hug. Bring it in.
How's your father's barn?
Shush, they'll all want one.
Well. Where have you been for three hundred years? Ha!
It's my ship.
It's my Tardis. That's how I got here in the first place.
What are you doing here?
Well, you were in the time vortex. She must have extended the force field. No wonder. No wonder she's late, dragging you around.
I saved you.
I'm furious with you!
The turkey isn't done yet.
Oh, never stops. Come upstairs. It's almost time.
Dawn. The light here lasts only a few minutes. You don't want to miss it.
Well, it's a standoff. They can't attack in case I unleash the Time Lords, and I can't run away, because they'll burn this planet to stop the Time Lords. Hey, after all these years, I've finally found somewhere that needs me to stick around. A town called Christmas. Could've been worse. Right, there you go, buddy. Comfy?
How's that, is that better?
You just take it easy, buddy. He's getting old. I do my best for him, but I just can't get the parts, you know. Hey, I know the feeling.
I have a supplier. The pink ones are best.
Hey, don't you worry, Handles. you're just dreaming. The sun's coming up very soon. You just hang on in there.
Hey, Handles. Come on. Come on. One more dawn, you can do it. You've got it in you. Come on, just hang on in there.
Handles, what is it? What's wrong?
Come back. Handles? Handles. Oh. Thank you, Handles, and well done. Well done, mate.
What do you think of my new place? I come up here once a day for a few minutes, to remind myself of what it is I'm protecting.
Because if I hadn't, I'd have buried you a long time ago.
Ha! Everyone gets stuck somewhere eventually, Clara. Everything ends.
Have you been paying attention? I'm an old man now.
No, not for ever. I can change twelve times. Thirteen versions of me. Thirteen silly Doctors.
Ha. Are we forgetting Captain Grumpy, eh? I didn't call myself the Doctor during the Time War, but it was still a regeneration.
Well, number ten once regenerated and kept the same face. I had vanity issues at the time. Twelve regenerations, Clara. I can't ever do it again. This is where I end up. This face, this version of me. We saw this planet in the future, remember? All those graves, one of them mine.
I can't.
Ha! You think I'm just going to fly away, abandon everyone?
There is no one else to protect it.
Every life I save is a victory. Every single one.
Clara, I've been having that argument for the last three hundred years, all by myself.
Ah. Yes, well, that made it easier to stay. True.
Ah. Look who's woken up.
I'll be right up.
Nah, don't bother. I've got me motor back.
Yeah, well, the sun's gone down.
Everything ends, Clara. And sooner than you think.
Hmm. Are you guarding my Tardis, Barnable?
Oh, come on. You know me.
No, she's against ageing.
Confessional priests. Very popular. Genetically engineered so you forget everything you told them.
There you go.
Where are the pink ones?
It can't end, either.
Well, I did come to Trenzalore, and nothing can change that now. Didn't stop you trying though, did it?
So that's who blew up my Tardis. I thought I'd left the bath running.
The destiny trap. You can't change history if you're part of it.
Totally married her. I'd never have made it here alive without River Song.
They attacked here?
Why didn't you call me? I could have helped.
No.
No! No, no, no. Tasha, no, please, not Tasha. No. Fight it. Tash, fight it!
You shouldn't even know who I am.
Bet she never told you how to break through the Trenzalore forcefield, though. She'd have died first.
Well, you'd better kill me, then. Go on. But before you do
I'm a tough old bird. I'll be ages dying. Way enough time to answer a question. And, oh dear, what happens then, boys?
Fine, go on, kill her. Kill her! See if I care. But tell me, what you are going to do next?
You see, Tasha, that's what I'm talking about. That is a woman! I always knew you were a bit spineless, you and your pointless church. Why did I ever rely on you? Never trust a nun to do a Doctor's work.
And she's back!
You never could resist a row.
Well, you'd better ask nicely.
Right, get us back to the Tardis. Can you do that?
Fight it.
Listen to me. You have been fighting the psychopath inside you all your life. Shut up and win. That is an order, Tasha Lem.
Then this isn't a siege any more, it's a war. It's all up to you now. Fight the Daleks, inside and out. You can do it, I know you can.
Tasha, please. Please. Thank you.
It's done.
Your turkey. Either that or its woken up.
Go on, then.
Do you know, I've even got Christmas crackers.
Clara Oswald, I will never send you away again.
Yeah, smells great.
It's a reminder. Besides, I might leave tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the day after that.
Barnable?
Were you always so young?
Ah.
Merry Christmas.
Ah! Is there a joke? Ha?
Is it a knock knock one? Those are best.
Well, read it. Go on.
I don't get it.
Oh, all right, Barnable. Are you Barnable?
It's okay, Barnable, don't worry. I have got a plan. Off you pop.
I haven't got a plan, but people love it when I say that.
Oh, I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens, take the credit. That's generally how it works.
Not this time, though. This is it.
Yes. We saw the future, Clara. This is how it ends.
Ha.
I could have once, when there were Time Lords. Not any more.
No. You're going to stay here. Promise me you will.
I'll be keeping you safe. One last victory. Allow me that. Give me that, my impossible girl. Thank you. And goodbye.
The trouble with Daleks is, they take so long to say anything. Probably die of boredom before they shoot me.
Sorry I'm a bit slow. I may not be at my best right now.
Yes, I'm dying. You've been trying to kill me for centuries, and here I am, dying of old age. If you want something done, do it yourself.
You still can't work up the courage to shoot me, can you? You're still worried I've got something up my sleeve. Well, you knock yourselves out, boys. I've got nothing this time.
Sorry, what did you say? Did you mention the rules? Now, listen. Bit of advice. Tell me the truth if you think you know it. Lay down the law if you're feeling brave. But, Daleks, never, ever tell me the rules!
Oh, look at this. Regeneration number thirteen. We're breaking some serious science here, boys. I tell you what, it's going to be a whopper!
You think you can stop me now, Daleks? If you want my life, ha, ha, come and get it!
Love from Gallifrey, boys!
Hello.
Ha! It's started. I can't stop it now. This is just the reset. A whole new regeneration cycle. Ooo.
Taking a bit longer. Just breaking it in. Oh. Oh. Gah.
It all just disappears, doesn't it? Everything you are, gone in a moment, like breath on a mirror. Any moment now, he's a-coming.
The Doctor.
Yep, and I always will be.
But times change, and so must I.
Amelia?
The first face this face saw. We all change, when you think about it. We're all different people all through our lives. And that's okay, that's good, you've got to keep moving, so long as you remember all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this. Not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me.
Hey
Kidneys! I've got new kidneys. I don't like the colour.
We're probably crashing. Oh!
Stay calm. Just one question. Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?

This place is enormous and deserted. The majority of the race are probably still asleep. We need to find Amy. Looking for heat signature anomalies.
Must be getting closer to the centre of the city.
Front door approach. Definitely. Always the best way.
Apart from the back door approach. That's also good. Sometimes better.
We're not hostile. We're not armed. We're here in peace.
Argh.
Decontamination? No, no, no.
No! Argh!
I'm not an ape. Look at the scans. Two hearts. Totally different. Totally not ape! Remove all human germs, you remove half the things keeping me alive.
Oh, that's much better, thanks. Not got any celery, have you? No. No, not really the climate. Tomatoes, though. You'd do a roaring trade in those. I'm the Doctor. Oh, and there's Nasreen. Good.
Hello. Who are you?
Oh dear, really? There's always a military, isn't there?
Oxygen pockets, lovely. Ooo, but not so good with an impending drill. Now it makes sense.
Invasion force. Me and lovely Nasreen? No. We came for the humans you took. And to offer the safe return of Alaya. Oh wait, you and she, what is it, same genetic source? Of course you're worried, but don't be, she's safe.
Wait, wait, we all want the same thing here.
What's that?
Yes.
These must be the only ones awake. The others must still be in hibernation.
Their astronomers predicted the planet heading to Earth on a crash course. They a built life underground and put themselves to sleep for millennia in order to avert what they thought was the apocalypse, when in reality it was the moon coming into alignment with the Earth.
Long time ago, I met another tribe of Homo Reptilia. Similar, but not identical.
The humans attacked them. They died. I'm sorry.
Oh, lovely place. Very gleaming.
Amy Pond. There's a girl to rely on.
Don't you touch her!
I'm glad you're okay.
Homo Reptilia. They occupied the planet before humans. Now they want it back.
Not to interrupt, but just a quick reminder to stay calm.
Steady now, everyone.
Let Rory deal with this, Ambrose, eh?
There's no need for this.
Don't do this!
Rory. Hello.
She's fine. Look, here, she is.
No time to chat. Listen, you need to get down here. Go to the drill storeroom. There's a large patch of earth in the middle of the floor. The Silurians are going to send up transport discs to bring you back down using geothermal energy and gravity bubble technology. It's how they travel and frankly, it's pretty cool. Bring Alaya. We hand her over, we can land this after all. All going to work, promise. Got to dash. Hurry up.
I'd say you've got a fair bit to talk about.
You both want the planet. You both have a genuine claim to it.
Me? No. But they are.
Course you are. Amy Pond and Nasreen Chaudhry, speaking for the planet? Humanity couldn't have better ambassadors. Come on, who has more fun than us?
Oh Nasreen, sorry. Probably worth mentioning at this stage, Amy and I travel in time a bit.
There are fixed points through time where things must always stay the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity. A temporal tipping point. Whatever happens today, will change future events, create its own timeline, its own reality. The future pivots around you, here, now. So do good, for humanity, and for Earth.
Come on. Be extraordinary.
Okay. Bringing things to order. The first meeting of representatives of the human race and Homo Reptilia is now in session. Ha! Never said that before. That's fab. Carry on. Now, Mo. Let's go and get your son. Oh, you know, humans, and their predecessors shooting the breeze. Never thought I'd see it.
Elliot. There you are.
But why?
You've been down here working by yourself, all alone?
Malohkeh, I rather love you.
Elliot. I'm sorry. I took my eye off you.
Not bad for a first session. More similarities than differences.
Here they are.
Something's wrong.
No. Don't do this. Tell me you didn't do this.
What did you do?
I'm sorry. I didn't know. You have to believe me, they're better than this.
We had a chance here.
In future, when you talk about this, you tell people there was a chance but you were so much less than the best of humanity.
One woman. She was scared for her family. She is not typical.
One person let us down, but there is a whole race of dazzling, peaceful human beings up there. You were building something here. Come on. An alliance could work.
Why?
Don't do this. Don't call their bluff.
No!
Everybody, back to the lab. Run.
This is a deadly weapon. Stay back.
Take everyone to the lab. I'll cover you.
Ah, ah, Stop right there or I'll use my very deadly weapon again. One warning, that's all you get. If there can be no deal, you go back into hibernation. All of you, now. This ends here.
Like I said, one warning.
Elliot, you and your dad keep your eyes on that screen. Let me know if we get company. Amy, keep reminding me how much time I haven't got.
Tony Mack. Sweaty forehead, dilated pupils. What are you hiding?
You're not dying, you're mutating.
Decontamination program. Might work. Don't know. Eldane, can you run the program on Tony?
So, question is, how we do stop the drill given we can't get there in time? Plus, also, how do we get out, given that we're surrounded? Nasreen, how do you feel about an energy pulse channelled up through the tunnels to the base of the drill?
Yes. Sorry. No nice way of putting that.
Yes. Squeaky bum time.
Eldane, are you sure about this?
No.
But maybe it should be. So, here's a deal. Everybody listening. Eldane, you activate shutdown. I'll amend the system, set your alarm for a thousand years time. A thousand years to sort the planet out. To be ready. Pass it on. As legend, or prophesy, or religion, but somehow make it known. This planet is to be shared.
Yes. Fluid controls, my favourite. Energy pulse. Timed, primed and set. Before we go, energy barricade. Need to cancel it out quickly.
Ah ha, super-squeaky bum time. Get ready to run for your lives. Now.
Okay, everyone follow Nasreen. Look for a blue box. Get ready to run.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me too.
Go. Go! I'm right behind you. Let's go.
What?
But, Nasreen, you
The pleasure was all mine.
Come on.
No questions, just get in. And yes, I know, it's big. Ambrose, sickbay up the stairs, left, then left again, Get yourself fixed up. Come on. Five minutes and counting. Not here.
Not now. It's getting wider.
Two parts of space and time that should never have touched, right here.
And the Byzantium. All through the universe, rips in the continuum.
Some sort of space-time cataclysm. An explosion, maybe. Big enough to put cracks in the universe. But what?
The Angels laughed when I didn't know. Prisoner Zero knew. Everybody knows except me.
But where there's an explosion, there's shrapnel.
Why not?
Argh. I've got something.
I don't know.
Okay, get in the Tardis, both of you.
Rory, can you hear me?
If the time energy catches up with you, you'll never have been born. It will erase every moment of your existence. You will never have lived at all. At all. At all. At all.
Amy, move away from the light. If it touches you, you'll be wiped from history. Amy, move away now.
The light's already around him. We can't help him.
We have to.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Keep him in your mind. Don't forget him. If you forget him, you'll lose him forever.
They weren't part of your world. This is different. This is your own history changing.
It's going to be hard, but you can do it, Amy. Tell me about Rory, eh? Fantastic Rory. Funny Rory. Gorgeous Rory. Amy, listen to me. Do exactly as I say. Amy, please. Keep concentrating. You can do this.
You can. You can do it. I can't help you unless you do. Come on. We can still save his memory. Come on, Amy. Please. Come on, Amy, come on. Amy, please. Don't let anything distract you. Remember Rory. Keep remembering. Rory's only alive in your memory. You must keep hold of him. Don't let anything distract you. Rory still lives in your mind.
An eye for an eye. It's never the way. Now you show your son how wrong you were, how there's another way. You make him the best of humanity, in the way you couldn't be.
Are you okay?
You go in. Just fix this lock. Keeps jamming.

There we go. Perfect landing. Which isn't easy in such a tight spot.
The end of the line. No place like it.
In fact, the morning after we left, so you've only been gone about twelve hours. No time at all, really.
Yep, all in one night, relatively speaking. Everything should be just as it was. Books, CDs, laundry. So, back were you were, as promised.
Yeah, I should probably er
Yes, yes, we should. One trip is what we said.
Mmm. Seems to happen to me a lot.
It was my pleasure.
No, I'm sorry. Did he say he was going to change what it means to be human?
Oh, black tie. Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens.
James Bond? Really?
Oh, look, they've got nibbles! I love nibbles.
Hello.
So, this Lazarus, he's your boss?
So do you know what the professor's going to be doing tonight? That looks like it might be a sonic microfield manipulator.
Science geek? What does that mean?
Oh, nice.
It's lovely to meet you, Mrs Jones. Heard a lot about you.
Oh, you know, that you're Martha's mother and. Er, no, actually, that's about it. We haven't had much time to chat. You know, been busy.
Oh you know. Stuff.
Something's wrong. It's overloading.
If this thing goes up, it'll take the whole building with it. Is that what you want?
Get it open!
Oh, it's not a trick. I wish it were.
He just changed what it means to be human.
Energy deficit. Always happens with this kind of process.
Doctor. And well, no, not every day, but I have some experience of this kind of transformation.
Using hypersonic sound waves to create a state of resonance. That's inspired.
Enough to know that you couldn't possibly have allowed for all the variables.
That thing nearly exploded. You might as well have stepped into a blender.
If I hadn't stopped it, it would have exploded.
This isn't about improving. This is about you and your customers living a little longer.
Oh, he's out of his depth. No idea of the damage he might have done.
Now? Well, this building must be full of laboratories. I say we do our own tests.
Oh, Martha Jones, you're a star.
Amazing.
Lazarus's DNA.
Look at it.
But it did.
And that's two impossible things we've seen so far tonight. Don't you love it when that happens?
Hypersonic sound waves to destabilise the cell structure, then a metagenic programme to manipulate the coding in the protein strands. Basically, he hacked into his own genes and instructed them to rejuvenate.
Because he missed something. Something in his DNA has been activated and won't let him stabilise. Something that's trying to change him.
I don't know, but I think we need to find out.
Let's go.
So where is he?
Used to be. Now it's just a shell. Had all the life energy drained out, like squeezing the juice out of an orange.
Could be.
Not necessarily. You saw the DNA. It was fluctuating. The process must demand energy. This might not have been enough.
Mmm.
He can't be far. Keep looking.
Where did they go?
Fluctuating DNA will give off an energy signature. I might be able to pick it up.
Got him.
Falls the Shadow.
I wouldn't have thought you had time for poetry, Lazarus, what with you being busy defying the laws of nature and all.
Doesn't work like that. Some people live more in twenty years than others do in eighty. It's not the time that matters, it's the person.
Or what a curse. Look at what you've done to yourself.
Run!
He must be breaking through that door. The stairs, come on!
We haven't got much time!
Tish, is there another way out of here?
Martha, setting fifty four. Hurry.
Listen to me! You people are in serious danger! You need to get out of here right now!
No! Get away from her!
Lazarus! Leave them alone.
What's the point? You can't control it. The mutation's too strong. Killing those people won't help you. You're a fool. A vain old man who thought he could defy nature. Only Nature got her own back, didn't she? You're a joke, Lazarus! A footnote in the history of failure!
Is that the same arrogance you had when you swore nothing had gone wrong with your device?
You call feeding on innocent people progress? You're delusional!
That's not your decision to make.
Oh, hello.
Have you looked in the mirror lately? Why would I want to face that, hmm?
What are you doing here?
How did you?
I blasted Lazarus.
More sort of annoyed him, I'd say.
We can't lead him outside. Come on, get in.
No, he knows we're here. But this is his masterpiece. I'm betting he won't destroy it, not even to get at us.
Well, yeah, that's a slight problem.
Yes, the plan was to get inside here.
Well, then I'd come up with another plan.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Here we are.
Improvise.
No, for once it's strictly human in origin.
Probably from dormant genes in Lazarus's DNA. The energy field in this thing must have reactivated them. And it looks like they're becoming dominant.
Some option that evolution rejected for you millions of years ago, but the potential is still there. Locked away in your genes, forgotten about until Lazarus unlocked it by mistake.
Exactly. Nice shoes, by the way.
Sounds like he's switched the machine on.
Well, I was hoping it was going to take him a little bit longer to work that out.
I know, I know. Nearly done.
I'm trying to set the capsule to reflect energy rather than receive it.
When he transforms, he's three times his size. Cellular triplication. So he's spreading himself thin.
Just one more!
Really shouldn't take that long just to reverse the polarity. I must be a bit out of practice.
Eliot saw that, too. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but with a whimper.
Ah, Mrs Jones. We still haven't finished our chat.
All of the mothers, every time.
Lazarus, back from the dead. Should have known, really.
That way. The church.
Where would you go if you were looking for sanctuary?
The Blitz.
I was there.
So are you.
That's what you were trying to do today?
What about the other people who died?
Any of them might have done too. You think history's only made with equations? Facing death is part of being human. You can't change that.
Look at yourself. You're mutating! You've no control over it. You call that a success?
There's no such thing as an ordinary human.
(sotto) I know. If I can get him up into the bell tower somehow, I've an idea that might work.
I'm old enough to know that a longer life isn't always a better one. In the end, you just get tired. Tired of the struggle, tired of losing everyone that matters to you, tired of watching everything turn to dust. If you live long enough, Lazarus, the only certainty left is that you'll end up alone.
Is it?
I'm not going to let that happen.
Martha, no.
Where are they? Martha?!
Take him to the top. The very top of the bell tower, do you hear me?!
Hypersonic sound waves. Inspired.
I hope it's a good acoustic in here.
We need to turn this up to eleven.
Martha?
Oh, well, you know, if you hang around with Beethoven, you're bound to pick a few things up.
Sorry?
Something else that just kind of escalated, then.
It's good fun, though, isn't it?
So, what do you say, one more trip?
What do you mean? I thought you liked it.
What're you talking about?
Okay, then. If that's what you want.
What? I said okay.
Okay.
Well, you were never really just a passenger, were you?

Yet. They're coming. They're coming for you, but listen, your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast, faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink. Good luck.
Martha.
Quite possibly. (pause) Afraid so.
Thirty eight.
Yeah. Yeah, people don't understand time. It's not what you think it is.
Complicated.
Very complicated.
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.
It got away from me, yeah.
Well, I can hear you.
Welcome.
1969. Not bad, as it goes. You've got the moon landing to look forward to.
Working on it.
The same way we did. The touch of an angel. Same one, probably, since you ended up in the same year. No, no. No, no, no, don't get up. Time travel without a capsule. Nasty. Catch your breath. Don't go swimming for half an hour.
Fascinating race, the Weeping Angels. The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death. The rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past, and in the present they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract. They live off potential energy.
Tracked you down with this. This is my timey-wimey detector. It goes ding when there's stuff. Also, it can boil an egg at thirty paces, whether you want it to or not, actually, so I've learned to stay away from hens. It's not pretty when they blow.
Normally, I'd offer you a lift home, but somebody nicked my motor. So I need you to take a message to Sally Sparrow. And I'm sorry, Billy. I am very, very sorry. It's going to take you a while.
Yup. That's me.
Yes, I do.
Yup. And this.
Are you going to read out the whole thing?
I'm a time traveller. Or I was. I'm stuck in 1969.
Martha.
Quite possibly.
Afraid so.
Thirty eight.
People don't understand time. It's not what you think it is.
Complicated.
Very complicated.
People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.
It got away from me, yeah.
Well, I can hear you.
Well, not hear you, exactly, but I know everything you're going to say.
Look to your left.
I've got a copy of the finished transcript. It's on my autocue.
I told you. I'm a time traveller. I got it in the future.
Yeah. Wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey.
What matters is, we can communicate. We have got big problems now. They have taken the blue box, haven't they? The angels have the phone box.
Creatures from another world.
Only when you see them.
The lonely assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly, and they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defence system ever evolved. They are quantum-locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they are seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice. It's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. Of course, a stone can't kill you either. But then you turn your head away, then you blink, and oh yes it can.
That's why they cover their eyes. They're not weeping. They can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. They can never be seen. The loneliest creatures in the universe. And I'm sorry. I am very, very sorry. It's up to you now.
The blue box, it's my time machine. There is a world of time energy in there they could feast on forever, but the damage they could do could switch off the sun. You have got to send it back to me.
And that's it, I'm afraid. There's no more from you on the transcript, that's the last I've got. I don't know what stopped you talking, but I can guess. They're coming. The angels are coming for you. But listen, your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink. Good luck.
This is security protocol seven one two. This time capsule has detected the presence of an authorised control disc, valid one journey.
Please insert the disc and prepare for departure.
Hello. Sorry, bit of a rush. There's a sort of thing happening. Fairly important we stop it.
Look, sorry, I've got a bit of a complex life. Things don't always happen to me in quite the right order. Gets a bit confusing at times, especially at weddings. I'm rubbish at weddings, especially my own.
What hasn't happened?
Got what?
Yeah, listen, listen, got to dash. Things happening. Well, four things. Well, four things and a lizard.
What was your name?
Good to meet you, Sally Sparrow.
Don't blink.
Blink and you're dead. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink. Good luck.

Mercy. Eighty one residents.
A load of stones and lumps of wood.
I see Keep Out signs as suggestions more than actual orders, like Dry Clean only.
That's not right.
An electric street lamp about ten years too early.
That's what you said when you left your phone charger in Henry the Eighth's en-suite.
Anachronistic electricity, Keep Out signs, aggressive stares. Has someone been peeking at my Christmas list?
Tea. But the strong stuff. Leave the bag in.
Son? You can stay.
Of course. I'm the Doctor. This is
No need to stand. You see that? Manners. Oh, thank you.
But I don't need a new suit.
Well, er, bit personal. It's all relative, isn't it? I mean, I think you're the aliens, but in this context, yes. Yes, I suppose I am.
Guys!
Rory, everything is completely under control. Guys, guys, guys.
Ow.
What was that outside?
What happens if someone crosses the line?
Ah, well, he wasn't a very good shot, then.
He shoots people's hats?
Ah, no, yes. I see. Hmm.
Well, that's what happens when people get toast crumbs on the console. Anyway, I think it's about time I met him, don't you?
The chap outside said I could be the alien doctor, but you said I wasn't, so you already know who it is. Two alien doctors. We're like buses. Resident eighty one, I presume, so beloved by the townsfolk he warranted an alteration to the sign. Probably because he rigged up these electrics, and I'm guessing he's in here, because if half the town suddenly wanted to throw me to my death, this is where I'd want to be.
The Kahler. I love the Kahler. They're one of the most ingenious races in the galaxy. Seriously, they could build a spaceship out of Tupperware and moss.
And you stayed, as their doctor.
So why does the Gunslinger want you?
I'm just saying, if we knew that
Did you try to repair your craft? Surely someone with your skills
We evacuate the town. Our ship's just over the hills, room for everyone. I'll pop out, bring it back here, Robert's your uncle.
I've matured. I'm twelve hundred years old now. Plus I don't want to miss The Archers.
Why would I be curious? It's a mysterious space cowboy assassin. Curious? Of course I'm not curious.
With a little sleight of hand.
Can I borrow your horse, please? It's official Marshal business.
No, he isn't. I speak horse. He's called Susan, and he wants you to respect his life choices.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, I know we're in a hurry. I just want to check something out. Two ticks.
There's something niggling me. Yes, yes, it could be important. Oi, don't swear.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, I wear a Stetson now.
Yes, a good point, Susan. Where is the damage?
This is an awful lot of security for a titchy spacecraft.
Tell me everything you can about the Gunslinger.
Personal files of Doctor Kahler-Jex.
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot. I know who you are, and who Jex is, too.
Now, what I don't understand is why you haven't just walked into town and killed him.
You want justice, you deserve justice, but this isn't the way. We can put him on trial
He's lying. Every word, every thing he says, it's all lies. This man is a murderer.
Sit down. Sit down! Tell them what you are.
The Gunslinger is a Cyborg.
Half man, half machine. A weapon. Jex built it. He and his team took volunteers, told them they'd been selected for special training, then experimented on them, fused their bodies with weaponry, and programmed them to kill.
And how many died screaming on the operating table before you had found your advantage?
Hmm? Yes. I don't know. Whatever Amy said.
No. No, but these people are. Out! Out! Out!
Go on.
Get over, and don't come back.
I genuinely don't know.
Or what? You won't shoot me, Amy.
We can end this right now. We could save everyone right now.
Jex has to answer for his crimes.
But they coming back, don't you see? Every time I negotiate, I try to understand. Well, not today. No. Today, I honour the victims first. His, the Master's, the Dalek's, all the people who died because of my mercy!
Amelia Pond. Fine, fine. We think of something else. But frankly, I'm betting on the Gunslinger.
Jex, move over the line. Now.
Isaac. Isaac. Isaac. It's okay, it's okay. We can get you to Jex's surgery. He can save you.
It won't come to that, Isaac.
Take Jex to his cell. If anything happens to him, you'll have me to answer to.
This has gone on long enough.
Yeah. And you're the Deputy.
Come in.
Why, what's wrong?
What's going on?
I promised Isaac I'd protect him.
You know I can't do that.
Please don't do this.
Oh, certainly not, but this? Lynch mobs? A town turning against itself? This is everything Isaac didn't want.
How old are you?
That's eighteen, then. Too young to have fought in the war, so I'm guessing you've never shot anyone before, have you?
But that's how all this started. Jex turned someone into a weapon. Now that same story's going to make you a killer, too. Don't you see? Violence doesn't end violence, it extends it, and I don't think you want to do this. I don't think you want to become that man.
I know, who I can save if you'll let me.
Don't know. But you are.
Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day.
Thank you.
Oi. Get out of it.
But I can't, can I. Because then Isaac's death would mean nothing. Just another casualty in your endless bloody war. Do you want me to hand you over? Is that what you want? Do you even know?
Oh, I know exactly what you are, and I see this reformation for what it really is. You committed an atrocity and chose this as your punishment. Don't get me wrong, good choice. Civilised hours, lots of adulation, nice weather, but, but justice doesn't work like that. You don't get to decide when and how your debt is paid.
We all carry our prisons with us. Ha!
Go! Just go! I can't save them while you're here.
Right.
He's gone.
Away from here. Look up. Any second now you'll see the vapour trail of his ship. This is their home, not the backdrop for your revenge. Lookup, go after him, take this battle away from
What are you doing? Just go!
Now? You're asking him this now?
Just go! Finish this!
What's going on?
The count down.
What's going on? Jex!
We could take you back to your world. You could help with the reconstruction.
Except maybe to protect it.
Okay, so, our next trip. Oh! You know all the monkeys and dogs they sent into space in the fifties and sixties? You will never guess what really happened to them.
Another time? No worry.

You've never been in here before.
Number two control room has been closed for redecoration. I don't like the colour.
That's the trouble with computers. Always think in black and white. No aquamarines, no blues, no imagination.
No, we haven't stopped.
Yes.
Solar system, between Jupiter and Saturn. About five thousand AD. Five thousand AD? We're still in the time of your ancestors.
Yes. That was the year of the great breakout.
Mmm. When your forefathers went leapfrogging across the solar system on their way to the stars. Asteroid belt's probably teeming with them now. New frontiersmen, pioneers waiting to spread across the galaxy like a tidal wave. Or a disease.
Oh, I do, I do. Some of my best friends are humans. When they get together in great numbers, other lifeforms sometimes suffer.
As soon as I've reset these coordinates, we'll go somewhere really interesting.
Distress call. From Titan. That message took half an hour to get here.
What does that matter? What's important is that someone needs help. Quadrant six two. WHI1212. 9990EX41.
What's the matter?
About what?
Hey.
There we are.
That's what?
What?
It wasn't?
Static. Nothing important.
There was? Oh. Well, a kind of Saint Elmo's fire. It happens at sea.
Yes, it causes a sort of halo effect round the masts of ships.
Why do you keep repeating everything I say? You're not a parrot, are you?
Yes. A parrot's a bird that repeats things. Move over.
That's it.
Well, there isn't anything wrong. Well, there isn't anything important wrong, but I've got to check it, haven't I?
Come on, old thing. Come on.
Hello, Lalee.
Rightly perfect, thank you yet, Lalee.
I said, I'm perfectly all right, thank you, Lalee.
Hmm? I know your name. Leela.
Must have had a bot of a shik.
A bot of a shik.
There's a voice or something in my head.
Nonsense. Just a nasty turn. Come on, we're on Titan. Let's take a look.
That was odd.
What?
We must go. We've had a mayday.
What, intuition?
What are you talking about, affected?
Leela, listen to me. I'm perfectly all right. Move over.
Nobody around. Not a soul.
Anyone home?
Disregard mayday. He said disregard mayday. Why?
Don't be gruesome.
You're a savage.
What did you say?
Evil again?
We'd better find it before it finds us.
Stay here.
Now listen, whatever happens.
Excuse me, you don't know me. Let me introduce myself.
People call me the D. Hives?
Are you all right? I answered your mayday.
That's right, that's right. Has someone been hurt?
What do you mean, of no importance? I just found a dead body out there.
I have arrived.
Reject should be destroyed.
And breeding from my nucleus begin.
Leela the reject will not suspect me.
That is not necessary.
Very well.
Leela? Leela, where are you?
Don't worry, Leela, it's only me. Listen to me, Leela. There's nothing wrong with this place. It's most suitable. It's a good place. A good place.
Come on, Leela. I'm waiting. Please leave me. Please. I can't do it. I can't do it.
I can't.
I can't.
The reject is here.
Yes. Kill her. Kill her.
I can't. I won't.
Leela.
Leela, I can't stop it.
Got to fight it. Got to fight it.
I'm fighting for my mind. Whatever it was that attacked Safran and the others is also affecting me.
Perhaps because. Oh! I can feel it gathering strength to attack again.
Some kind of organism that attacks the mind, the intelligence. It's trying to take me over, Leela. It's trying to change me.
I need help. I must withdraw into myself, save strength.
Vector one nine, quadrant three. Seven four three.
Eight zero zero.
Hello.
Find anything?
Yes. What have you found?
Yes.
Yes.
Self-preservation. Whatever it is I'm suffering from seems to thrive on intellectual activity.
Yes. Non-thinking is the only way to shake it off, but I can't stay mindless for eternity, can I.
Ah. Hello.
How are you?
I know what noetic means.
Mind-brain interface.
But of course. How stupid. That's why it attacked the Tardis computer first. It was showing the greatest amount of mental activity. I was just idling, so to speak.
When we were first attacked. We were on our way to Titan. I assumed it was just a static build-up. Then when I checked the computer, it jumped into my mind, and that explains why Leela was
Why Leela was unaffected. Have you met Leela?
She's all instinct and intuition.
That's why the virus rejected her. Of course. I begin to see it all now.
Yes. The entire crew on Titan. Well, one exception. The supervisor, man called Lowe.
What was that?
What!
I don't think that was an accident.
It must be something to do with whatever's in my head. (to K9) Can I have a word with you? (to Leela) Where are you going?
K9. Cloning techniques. Give me a rundown, state of the art so far.
Go on, go on.
Thirty nine twenty two. Oh good.
Hurry, K9, hurry.
How long? How long?
Professor Marius, could you clone me?
Could you clone me now?
Yes. Because if you don't clone me now and the virus gets to me, it'll take the whole centre with it.
Hurry, Marius. Hurry.
Leela. I shall need Leela.
Just you trust me, Professor. Just trust me.
Don't you worry, Professor. If this doesn't work, the whole place'll be destroyed anyway.
It's a Relative Dimensional Stabiliser. RDS.
It's part of a Tardis control system, the part that allows me to cross the dimensional barrier. It's quite simple, really. It means I can change shape, large or small, as I wish. Yes. Won't keep you a moment.
Now listen, Professor. You operate the RDS. We'll be reduced to micro-dimensions. You'll then scoop us both up and inject us into my master-print there. Any questions?
Because she's immune and because she's a huntress.
Yes. Just stay here and hope we come back with the antidote. And Professor?
When we emerge, we'll be coming out through the tear duct.
Thank you.
Well, what do you think?
No.
Thank you.
Because we're too small to break the surface tension.
Oh, just a passing thought. Electrochemical reaction in the synapses. Leg wants to move.
Yes?
What do you mean, I've got no idea where we're going? We're travelling along my neural pathways looking for a sort of bridge, a crossover point between the left lobe and the right lobe.
Since it seems to control both the conscious and unconscious it's a good enough place to start.
What? No, no, no. It came in through the optic nerve. We are somewhere between the spinal cord and the cerebellum. But keep your eyes open for tissue deterioration.
That's me you're kicking.
Doesn't look like the most advanced computer system ever, does it.
That is why my brain is so much superior to yours.
What is it?
Rubbish. If there was any danger about, I'd be the first to scent it. I know this brain like the back of my hand. Danger. What do you know about brains, anyway?
I'll get excited if I want to. It's my brain. Danger. I'll tell you something about brains. Do you want to know something?
I'll tell you anyway. Somebody once tried to build a machine as efficient as the brain. Only trouble was, it would have had to have been bigger than London. Do you remember London? And powered by the entire European grid. And that was just a human brain. Mine's much more complex. Left and right sides working in unison via the specialised neural ganglia, thus combining data storage and retrieval with logical interest and the intuitive leap. And here. Are you listening to me?
That is a reflex link, whereby I can tune myself into the Time Lord intelligentsia. A thousand super-brains in one.
What? Oh, well, I lost that particular faculty when they kicked me out. Oh look.
Oh look. Connection seven. Hello.
Don't be funny.
No, no, no. Come on over here. This is recent damage.
What else. We must be getting close to it now.
What?
I can't! It's my body defence mechanism. They're my own phagocytes. Use your knife!
Oh.
I think I told them my liver was disintegrating. I think.
That's very clever.
After you.
Not necessarily, no. From now on, we're on the trail of the virus, and that's the path it took.
Well, if I knew that, I wouldn't have brought you along. From now on, this is where your tracking skills come in.
What is it?
What?
That was your outside head.
No, it isn't all right. You and I have only got a limited life in here. Your outside self and your inside self are made of the same tissue. Your outside self is hurt, then you feel a shock. Your outside self is killed, yes.
Yes.
This is the gap between one side of our mind and the other.
Well of course it's dark. It's the gap between logic and imagination. You can't see one side from the other side.
What?
This is the mind-brain interface, Leela. At least I think it is. That's the mind and that's the brain. Two things entirely different but part of the same thing.
That's right, that's right.
Yes. Sometimes I don't quite understand it myself.
Bracing, isn't it?
The interface. The mind unsullied by a single thought.
Into the land of dreams and fantasy, Leela.
Well, on the way to it.
Who are you?
You're trespassing, you know. Treading on my unconscious, affecting my metabolism. Nucleus of what?
Oh. Oh, I see. Why did you choose my brain?
Oh, well, I can understand that, but do you realise you have no right
Oh yes, I do, I do. And on your argument, I have a perfect right to dispose of you.
Touch.
Carriers? What do you mean, carriers? I'm not a porter.
But you intend to dominate both worlds, the micro and the macrocosm.
Time?
New masters? Not if I can help it.
Get out of my brain.
Get out of my brain!
The tear duct. The tear duct. The tear duct. The tear duct. The tear duct. Tear duct.
Professor Marius. Oh no, not you too.
What? That pathetic crustacean, your leader?
Finding the macro world difficult?
I thought I'd got rid of you.
Yes, you'd have known about that, wouldn't you.
I've heard it all before. You megalomaniacs are all the same.
Now nothing.
No, we can't. The dimensional stabiliser's still in the isolation ward. Without it, the Tardis won't move an inch.
I didn't say that. K9. Now listen to me, K9. Do you think you could poleaxe, do you think you could poleaxe Marius?
Yes, knock him out.
No, no, no, not kill. Not kill. Just knock out.
Good dog.
You're a good dog, K9. Good dog.
Come on, Leela, quickly. We haven't got a moment to spare. Not frightened of blood, are you? You, the mighty huntress.
I had a virus then. I'm immune now. Something must have happened while you and I were inside my head. I want to find out what. Ah, that's interesting. You see that?
That little fish hook is the only thing that you and I have in common. It wasn't there before, so it must be the antibody, the immunity factor.
Quite simple. Your clone was absorbed into my bloodstream and passed on the immunity to me. All we've got to do is isolate it, analyse it, duplicate it and inject it into Marius here, and he in turn will be able to cure all the others.
Come on, one thing at a time. One thing at a time.
Sometimes my brilliance astonishes even me. Come on, Marius. Wake up, wake up. Come on.
He's dead, I'm afraid. Do you remember anything?
Yes and no. Unfortunately the Nucleus got away by means of the dimensional stabiliser. It's on its way to Titan to breed.
Yes, it got to you.
It was something in Leela. Something we all missed. This is it. You'll have to cultivate a great deal more.
If those antibodies can confer immunity, they can be used to attack the Nucleus.
Of course it's dangerous. If we allow the Nucleus to breed and swarm, it'll go through the entire Solar System like a plague of giant locusts.
Yes, by means of the dimensional stabiliser.
We can't rush these things. They're breeding as fast as they can. K9 will tell us when they've got the most powerful strain.
That's your answer to everything, isn't it, knock it on the head.
With what? This is a hospital, not an arsenal.
Thank you, K9.
Now, just get it into the tanks and wait for it to attack the Nucleus in the same way it attacked us. Microscopically. It's neat, don't you think?
I don't.
The virus has a perfect right to exist as a virus, not as a giant storm threatening the entire Solar System. Everything has its place. Otherwise the delicate balance of the whole cosmos is destroyed.
Good. Now for the Tardis.
Thank you, Professor. Oh, Professor.
I don't suppose we could borrow K9, could we?
Shush.
Well, I'm not at liberty to say, but he could be very useful.
They're starting to hatch. Let's go.
There's a man at the door.
Come in.
They're developing a resistance to radiation. Their internal cell structure
Shall we try using our intelligence?
Come on.
(sotto) K9, do you see that guard?
(sotto) I want you to decoy him.
Good dog. Your turn now, Leela. See you back at the Tardis.
What was that?
Well, I'd rather not, actually.
Oh look, look, they appear to be hatching. Are congratulations in order?
Well done, K9, well done. Come on. Let's get out of here while there's still time.
What? Come on.
Come on.
No, I lost the antibodies.
You have?
Can you do that to a thousand? A thousand thousand?
That's a good idea. Take K9 back to the Tardis. He's out of juice.
Well, as far as I know, there's no one else except you and me here, so it must be me.
Not quite.
Well, that depends on how long it's going to take you to get out of there.
Yes.
Yes. Methane atmosphere. Mix well with oxygen and run. That was a good idea of mine, K9, to blow it up.
What was?
Well then, you should be feeling very happy.
Goodbye.
It's been a pleasure, Professor. It's been a pleasure. Do you know that without K9 I think we'd have been part of the Swarm by now.
What?
No.

You said
You said it was looking at you funny.
It's a pretty cool appliance. We're not talking cheese grater here.
(to console) It's okay, it's okay.
It's important to me you get along. I could leave you two alone together.
Take the wheel. Not the wheel. I'll make it easy. Shut it down to basic mode for you.
No.
Er, okay.
All the electrical impulses are jammed. I can't get the shields back up. She's completely vulnerable.
Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.
Oh, yes. Big friendly button.
Yep.
Is it working?
It's rude to whisper. Hi. I'm the Doctor. And you are? Er, Van Baalen and Van Baalen. Van Baalen and Van Baalen. That's going to get confusing later.
What broke my ship was a magno-grab. Found this remote in your pocket. Eh? What are the chances? Outlawed in most galaxies, this little beastie can disable whole vessels unless you have shield oscillators, which I turned off so that Clara could fly, damn it. Clara. Where is she? Girl, about so high. Feisty. She's still on board.
Ah, respirators.
Trust me, we can't. Now please, help me get her out.
If you help me get her out, you get the machine, all the scrap, eh?
What if I can guarantee you the best haul you've ever had?
No, no. Please, stop. Listen, listen. Right behind those doors is the salvage of a lifetime.
Tell me, since when does an android need a blast suit and a respirator?
I feel pretty confident I can deliver on that. Here we go.
The Tardis is special. She has her own gravity. I'd explain if I had some charts and a board pen.
On the inside. Do you know, I get that a lot.
Well put. Whoa and awesome.
Safe to breathe.
Okay, now, the last thing I remember, you were right there. Come on, Clara, talk to me.
Picture the biggest ship you've ever seen. Are you picturing it?
Good. Now forget it, because this ship is infinite.
Days. Plus this whole place is toxic. She could be dead by the time I reach her. So, here's the mission. We're going to find her in one hour.
You're my guys for this.
'Tis now.
I just activated the Tardis self-destruct system. One hour until this ship blows.
Don't try to leave. The Tardis is in lockdown. I'll open those doors when Clara's by my side.
My ship, my rules.
She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into a spaceship with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, a little gently persuasion. Say thirty minutes.
We all perform better under pressure. Anybody want to go for fifteen minutes?
It's your own time you're wasting. Salvage of a lifetime. You meant the ship. I meant Clara.
Don't touch a thing. The Tardis will get huffy if you mess.
The Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.
That's trans-dimensional engineering. A key Time Lord discovery.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door. Believe me, they've tried.
No! No, no, stop! Please, don't. Don't touch it. Please. She won't let you touch it. I can feel a Tardis tantrum coming on.
Architectural Reconfiguration System. It reconstructs particles according to your needs.
Yes, basically. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Don't!
If you walk out of here with that circuit, the Tardis will try to stop you. Now listen to me. Look, the clock is ticking. We must find Clara.
Ever seen a spaceship get ugly?
She won't relinquish it. Her basic genetic material.
It's diverting us, spinning a maze around us. We will never reach Clara in time.
Hey! Hey!
No point in building walls. You'll just know how to smash them down. It's found other ways of controlling you. Smart bunch, Time Lords. No dress sense, dreadful hats, but smart. If you want to get out of here, let that circuit go. It is creating a labyrinth.
Your concern for your brother is really touching. The android is more cut up about it that you. Now will you two stop bickering and listen. There is something else down there.
Fellas! Multiple lifeforms on board the Tardis with us. I am getting a massive signal.
Oh, you're not going to like the answer. About two steps away. One step.
Gregor, look out! Careful! Gregor, no! We have to stay together. Come on, run. Tricky, run. I'm sorry.
No, it's an echo. The console room is the safest place on the ship. It can replicate itself any number of times. It's trying to protect us.
Team Tardis.
There's more than one echo room. Hey, look, look. The Tardis has got Clara safe. That was her. That was her there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
It's like a light switch. Two positions, flickering at super-infinite speeds. We're only together for a brief second. Shush.
I can hear her.
If I can just isolate her position, I can nudge the alternation, reach in and grab her.
It doesn't know Lancashire.
It doesn't know sass. Yes! It's found Clara. It's found her. She is right there.
It's all right. Clara, I'm so, so sorry. Sorry. Please, please forgive me, Clara.
Ow! Okay, so we're not doing hugging. I get that now.
Not in front of the guests.
Friends. Well, people who aren't trying to kill us, so I don't need punching again.
Ah. Ah. You know, I've got to tell you, I won't be needing you in my quiz team.
There is no self-destruct. Hey? Hey? Hey? Had you going though, boys, didn't I? I just wiggled a few buttons. Yeah, the old wiggly button trick. And the face. You've got to do the face. Save her or we all die. I though I rushed it a bit, but
Ish. Apart from the monsters and the Tardis reinventing the architecture every five minutes. Guys, don't worry. The countdown's a fake. Look, just give me a second. I'll turn it off. I only made it look as though the engine was actually exploding.
Ah. That's not good. Okay, don't panic. Or maybe panic.
It appears the engine is damaged. We're in trouble, Clara. Proper trouble. It needs fixing or we're toast.
Yes. Sorry, I should have had one built in.
Detour.
The centre of the Tardis.
Trust me. Some things you don't want to know.
Run. Move, move.
You said it was looking at you funny.
Clara, stop. Don't touch it. There's a rupture in time somewhere on board the ship. A small tear in the fabric of the continuum. It must have happened when the Tardis was pulled in by the salvage vessel. The Tardis is leaking.
The past. You and me. Everything we've done, everything we've said. Recent history. It's not real. It's a memory.
If you're giving me the option, I'd say this one's real.
She's right on to us.
Clara, don't ask me any more.
It's important to me you get along.
We're right under the primary fuel cells.
So, so the fuel's spilled out, so the rods will be exposed. Means they'll cool
And start to warp. Maybe even
Maybe even break apart.
I'm liking how you're thinking.
Tell him.
You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, but you're scared to tell him why.
Robots don't need blast suits. They don't need respirators. They don't get frightened of monsters in the dark.
Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend, are human. Flesh and blood.
Well, it was very funny. They lied to you. Changed your identity just to provide some in-flight entertainment.
Cut the metal. Cut the metal! Go!
Power source. Right, you lot, wait here. I'll check it's safe. We can only survive for a minute or two in there.
Our cells with liquefy and our skin will start to burn.
Marvellous. Keep this door shut.
Stop! Tricky, listen to me. Ask yourself why he couldn't cut you up. He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him, and you helped him find that, okay? Now you. Don't ever forget this.
Okay, move, move, move.
The Eye of Harmony. Exploding star in the act of becoming a black hole. Time Lord engineering. You rip the star from its orbit, suspend it in a permanent state of decay. This way, quickly.
I can't.
Secrets protect us. Secrets make us safe.
No, no, turn it off!
I'm so sorry.
It isn't just the past leaking out through the time rift. It's the future. Listen, I brought you here to keep you safe, but it happened again. You died again.
Hang on. As long as we can interrupt the timeline, this can't happen. Don't touch each other, otherwise the future will reassert itself.
Gregor, Gregor, let go of the circuit.
Gregor, Gregor.
Okay. Er, er
No, don't touch him, or time will reassert itself.
The engine room. The heart of the Tardis.
No, we're still in the Tardis.
No, okay, you're right.
Well, no. No plan. Sorry.
Yes, we are. So just tell me.
Well, there's no point now. We're about to die. Just tell me who you are.
No, I don't. I look at you every single day and I don't understand a thing about you. Why do I keep running into you?
Before that. I met you in the Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a shipwreck and she died saving my life, and she was you.
Victorian London. There was a governess who was really a barmaid, and we fought the Great Intelligence together. She died and it was my fault, and she was you.
What are you, eh? Are you a trick, a trap?
You really don't, do you.
You're just Clara, aren't you.
We're not going to die here. This isn't real! It's a snarl.
What does a wounded animal do? It tries to scare everyone away. We're close to the engine. The Tardis is snarling at us, trying to frighten us off. We need to jump.
We'll cross a portal to the engine.
I can't.
Hey now, Clara, I have piloted this ship for over nine hundred years. Trust me this one time, please. Okay. Okay. As well as all the other times. Ready? Geronimo.
The heart of the Tardis. The engine, it's already exploded. It must have been the collision with the salvage ship.
She wrapped her hands around the force. Froze it.
Temporary fix. Eventually this whole place will erupt. There's no way I can save her now. She's just always been there for me, and taken care of me, and now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. I think it just
Oh, Clara. Oh.
You are beautiful. Beautiful fragile human skin. Like parchment. Thank you. The rift in time. All the memories leaking out. I need to find the moment we crashed. I need to find the music.
The time rift. Recent past, possible future.
Rewrite today, I hope.
I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make sure this time. Going to take it in there myself. There might be a certain amount of yelling.
Things that end your life often do that.
Clara, don't worry. You'll forget. Time mends us. It can mend anything.
I'm mentioned in a lot of books.
If I rewrite today, you won't remember. You won't go looking for my name.
It's better that way.
Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.
Oh, yes. Big friendly button.
Yep.
Is it working?
Doctor, Doctor. I'm from your future. We haven't got long to reset time.
Clara, no! No!
Ah ha! Big friendly button.
We've had two days crammed into the space of one.
I don't know. I say stuff. Ignore me. Do you feel safe?
Give me a number out of ten. Ten being whoo hoo, one being argh.
I need to know if you feel safe. I need to know you're not afraid.
The future. Running away with a spaceman in a box. Anything could happen to you.

Haven't you done enough damage already?
Here, let me have a try. Just needs a little friendly persuasion, that's all.
Probably too friendly. I said a little friendly. Firm but friendly. Watch.
There.
It's jammed. I've lost control. We're adrift in E-space.
Have we?
Maybe that's it.
The way out of E-space.
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just following intuition.
What's so improbable about tossing a coin? Never heard of the I-Ching?
Random samplings that affect the broad flow of the material universe.
The holistic view.
It's always darkest before the storm.
Dawn. Isn't that right, K9?
Yes, well that might help.
You didn't really think I'd activate the Reverse Bias, did you? Huh. It's extremely difficult to generate non-determinate action. I mean, ha. Maybe, subconsciously, I wanted to press that button.
Yes. In full flight.
No, I don't think so. Don't you want to get back to Gallifrey?
Well, we'll burn that bridge when we come to it. It's all academic unless we find the CVE.
What about Adric?
So?
Oh, he'll love it on Gallifrey.
What have you just done? What's he just done, K9? K9: Nondeterminate activity in accordance with the theory you were offering, master.
Oh, that's perfectly all right then.
You all right, Romana?
Adric?
Good.
Ah! Time winds!
Of course. That's how he got in. He's on a different timeline.
About the same way as we can see him.
Others?
The shadow of his past
Romana, check those coordinates.
Yes. Now listen, you two stay here and hold the fort. I'm going to follow Biroc. Come on K9. K9? Come on. He wasn't built to withstand this type of punishment. Come on now, come on.
He's still alive!
Yes?
Yes. Ponder on that.
This could be a very short friendship.
You're a machine. I usually get on so well with machines. I don't suppose you happen to know the way out into N-space, do you? I believe it's somewhere around here. It's er.
Uh oh.
They've cut each other dead.
Poor things. Hardly any better off than K9. Ah ha. Memory wafer.
What particular brutes did you have in mind?
Gateway? Gateway to where?
Gateway to where? Just as it was getting interesting. If only I had an alternative source of energy.
K9. Just the chap I wanted.
Listen, K9, I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this, but all this stuff about the gateway is terribly important.
The whole thing's critically critical, old chap. This could be the way out. Now come on, be a good dog and power up.
Come on, power up. Up, up, up, up. Good dog. Now. Now. What's all this about the gateway?
Yes, well, look, look, I'm sure this is frightfully interesting. Could you get back on to the bit about the gateway, please?
Your ordinary world. I'm from N-space.
Ah ha.
Well
The thing is, it's not actually a physical gateway that I'm looking for.
Ah. So it is here. The way out.
Oh, hello. You seem to have attracted a big audience.
Ah, ahem, he, er, he doesn't seem to be too sure of his lines.
All the gateways are one. All the gateways are one. You see, I'm so sorry, he's completely run down. I'm the Doctor, by the way, and that's K9, and we just happened to
Gundans, eh?
Stop that Gundan!
Come on, K9. Nearly there.
Biroc, how did I get through the mirror?
What?
But what about K9? The time winds positively blasted him. Can he pass through the mirror?
K9! If we can get him through the mirror, will it repair him?
What? That's right. Yes, I have. Look. Look.
Then we must get him here.
So K9 can only be revived on this side of the mirror?
No, don't go. Don't go, please. Where is this place? Where have you brought us?
What? The gateway still? But that's nowhere.
I see. I see. E-Space. That's right. Yes, for you people it's a jumping off point for E-space, but for non-time sensitives, Biroc. Biroc, I understand. Biroc? He's gone again. It's like talking to a Cheshire cat.
I must be crossing the striations of the time lines.
My goodness. You live like kings.
Such variety. Where did it all come from?
Ah. So this is what it was all like.
I notice you don't do too badly for staff. This garden of yours, the universe. How do you manage it?
Including her?
So you're the masters the Gundan spoke of? The enslavers.
Yes, yes. This is no way to run an empire.
And for me, too.
Yes.
Yes. It's alarming, isn't it? And the culinary arrangements are variable, too.
Much the best way, if you can do it.
Shush. Not so aggressive. We're all in the same boat and they know it.
I do?
Oh, no, no. One way only. That's for Tharils.
A hungry bunch. Now, listen. There's nothing beyond those mirrors for people like us, except the reflection of what's here. Only the Tharils can enter your universe that way and that's a talent they're born with. The talent that you hunt them for.
Yes. Now, unless we work very closely together, we could be caught here until the crack of doom. Oh, what's the use. Could I have one of your pickles? I had a rush lunch.
Well, that goes for all of us. Yeah, soon we won't be better off than that chap over there.
When the pickles run out.
K9! Where have you been, my dear old thing?
Don't say that! He may have a point. What mass conversion anomaly?
Contraction? This could be serious.
What?
No, that's not funny. That's. What's causing it?
I think not! If K9's right, and he usually is, this place is in worse shape than we thought it was.
Soon it may not even be that.
Quite a lot. How long have we got, K9?
Slowly.
Yes, yes, but it would need a huge mass to disturb time and space to that extent. Even the Tardis doesn't weigh that much. Neither does their ship.
What?
Dwarf star alloy? What are you playing at? Is it something to do with these?
Yes. Trading in time sensitives. And dwarf star alloy is the only material that will hold them.
How many more of those poor creatures have you got in that hulk of yours?
No wild theory about contraction. K9. No, K9. K9!
Yes. As the domain contracts.
Playing for time? Quite the reverse.
Yes, and if I can get back to my Tardis, I can prove it and find out exactly how much time we have left.
Hello, Biroc.
As you said, the weak enslave themselves.
I wish you luck. But what about us? Have you got any ideas on that count?
What?
Biroc? Biroc? It's all very well for you, but
Oh, he's just a friend of mine. Adric, Romana, get K9 outside, quickly.
Don't move, lads. It's on automatic.
Come on, let's find the Tardis.
There she blows.
Yes, well, that's one of the advantages of living in a rapidly shrinking micro-universe.
Other what?
Ah, well, it's difficult to say.
No.
Shush. Mass attraction. There's something moving out there. It's shaking the entire gateway.
Back blast.
Back blast. He's going to use the jets to try and smash through the mirrors.
Yes.
Yes.
Shush.
I'm not hopeful.
Yes. What damaged area?
What?
Yes?
No.
Right. Stop! If I'm not back for whatever reason in thirteen and a half minutes, I want you to dematerialise.
That's an order. It's about time you started accepting orders.
With my eyes.
Good. Come on.
I like that. I think you're improving.
Indifference? Thirteen and a half minutes.
Look here, Rorvik. You've got to stop this back blast. You'll kill us all.
You can't blast through those mirrors. You must realise by now it just throws the energy straight back.
Never mind the clipboard, short the cables.
Drain the main power line. Earth it to the ladder.
Biroc? What are you doing here?
It's all right for you.
Do nothing?
Yes, that's right. Do nothing, if it's the right sort of nothing.
We've made it. Quick, quick, inside. What's the matter?
Inside. That's an order.
What? What a moment to choose.
No, no, no. Wait, wait. There's something else. K9. He'll be all right with you behind the mirrors.
I'll miss you. You were the noblest Romana of them all.
Yes.
So it has. Nothing. Well, that's something.
Well, if the E-space image translator doesn't work, I'm hoping we're in N-space.
Yes.
Did I say sure?
Yes. One solid hope's worth a cartload of certainties.
All right? She'll be superb.

Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvel, Judge Jefferies, Owen Chadwick.
Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes. Some of the greatest labourers in the history of Earth have thought here.
Oh, definitely Newton.
That's right.
Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius.
Restful?
It's October.
I did. May week's in June.
So was the Tardis.
Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing can go wrong. No coordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just the water, a punt, a strong pair of hands and the pole.
Er, I think it's about time that we go and see if the Professor is back in his room. Ask me how.
For every reaction there is an opposite and equally different action.
What?
Here we are, St. Cedd's College, Cambridge. Founded in the year something or other, by someone someone in honour of someone someone someone. In honour of someone who's name escapes me completely.
Do you know I think you're very probably right. You should have been an historian.
Good afternoon, Wilkin.
Wilkin! You remembered me.
Yes, but how kind of you to remember me.
And you do it splendidly. Now
Oh good, good, good. Wilkin, how did you know I wanted to speak to Professor Chronotis?
Did I really? I was here in 1958.
Yes, but in a different body.
Nice to meet you, Wilkin. Bye, bye.
Come in. Over there. He'll ask us if we want tea.
Yes, please. Two cups.
Yes, please.
Two please, and two sugars.
You too, Professor. This is Romana.
Have you really?
Well, I wouldn't have said no.
Oh, sometimes.
What can you do for me? You mean what can I do for you? You sent for me.
Yes, we got your signal.
Romana, didn't we get a signal from the Professor, would we come as soon as possible?
I will. Professor, if you didn't send a signal, who did?
I thought you said you didn't.
Yes, but you're always saying that.
Professor?
What was it about, Professor?
The message?
Was it to do with the voices?
Well, when I was on the river I heard a strange babble of inhuman voices. Didn't you, Romana?
No, no, no, no. It wasn't like that at all. It was the sound of humans, or ghosts, very quietly
Yes.
What?
Professor, I think that. I just heard voices. Romana, Did you just hear voices?
Anything to do with that book, Professor?
Professor, you said you brought it back by accident.
You thought that perhaps I'd take it straight back to Gallifrey for you.
Professor, I don't want to be critical but I will. It's very risky bringing books back from Gallifrey.
I mean, they could be so dangerous in the wrong hands, hmm?
(reads) On some nights, New York was as hot as Bangkok. (The Victim.) I've read that.
Once upon a time. Read that. Ah. And in the Great Days of Rassilon, five great principles were laid down. Can you remember what they were, my children?
I know, I know.
It's very good.
Professor? Professor? How many books did you bring back, for heaven's sake?
Dangerous?
The Worshipful And Ancient Law Of Gallifrey?
Professor, how did that book get out of the Panopticon Archives?
Took it?
And were they?
Excuse me. Delicate matter, Professor, slightly.
That book dates back to the days of Rassilon.
It's one of the artefacts.
Professor, you know that perfectly well. Rassilon had powers and secrets that even we don't fully understand. You've no idea what might have been hidden in that book.
I only hope you're right, but we'd better find it. Romana?
Little red book.
Good, good.
British Book of Bird Life, in colour.
Time Machine.
(reads) Tandoori Chicken for starters? Huh.
Yes, but there's no sign of the Worshipful and Ancient Law of Gallifrey.
Of course. It's one of the artefacts.
Yes. Each of the artefacts was imbued with stupendous power. The meaning of most of them has been lost by now, but the powers remain, and the rituals.
What words?
Yes. Pompous lot. All words and no actions.
Salyavin. Oh yes. He was a boyhood hero of mine.
A criminal, yes, but he had such style, such flair, such
Yes, yes. A bit like me in that respect.
I certainly did not!
He was imprisoned before I was born.
On. (pause) Do you know, I can't remember. Professor?
Salyavin. He was a contemporary of yours, wasn't he? Where was he imprisoned?
I've only just asked you.
Where Salyavin was imprisoned..
Professor, what do you think we're doing?
What?
What was his name, Professor? What was his name?
What was his name, Professor?
What?
What was his name, Professor?
C?
Young!
Where would he be now, Professor?
Yes, yes, I'll be back in two minutes. (to Romana) If I'm not back in two hours, you and the Professor lock yourselves in the Tardis, send out an all-frequency alert, and wait. Wait!
Yes.
Well, I'm the Doctor and you can't have it.
Yes, it'll be taken to a place of safety.
Oh, a little place I have in mind. SKAGRA: Doctor, you will give to me everything that you have in your mind. Your mind shall be mine.
I'm not mad about your tailor.
I beg your pardon.
Yes.
Coming.
Who are you?
Never heard of you. You're the one causing all the trouble.
Where's the Professor?
He just what?
Where was the body?
Here?
He's gone. He must have been on his very last regeneration. Did you say someone had stolen his mind?
Yes, that's what Skagra threatened to do to me.
You know the name?
What?
Shada?
Shada, Shada. No. You?
Well, Mister Skagra, or whatever it is you call yourself, you've killed a Time Lord and a very old friend of mine. It's time you and I had a little chat. K9!
K9, can you find any trace of that sphere?
We'll have to wait till it's active again. Now listen, K9, the moment the signal becomes clear
Good, good. Right, we'll wait in the Tardis.
Come on. You too, Bristol.
Look!
Did you just see what I didn't see?
Neither did I.
That's what I said. Watch that cow pat.
Ow! Don't move.
K9, there's something here.
Then why didn't you tell me, you stupid animal?
Shush. K9, what's it powered by?
Aren't we all? Where does it come from?
One hundred metres? That should keep the cows guessing. Hmm. There must be an entrance somewhere.
Got to be an entrance. What's that carpet doing here?
Affirmative, K9, affirmative.
Come along, K9, heel.
Where are we?
Neither do I.
Why not?
What? Do you understand Einstein?
What? And quantum theory?
What? And Planck?
What? And Newton?
What? And Schoenberg?
You've got a lot to unlearn. Ah.
Institute for Advanced Science Studies.
Shush.
Shush. Did you hear something?
Shush.
Ah ha! Think Tank. Quite interesting.
Oh yes! It's all terrible simple. You see, when
Victims of Skagra's brain drain. Their intellectual powers have been stolen. But their memory patterns might remain. Yes.
Yes. What?
Bristol?
Bristol, I'd like you to do something for me.
It won't be pleasant.
There we are. Bristol?
I'm going to allow this man access to your intelligence reserves.
It's all right, it's only temporary. It might just allow him to function.
So do I. So do I. Now, take a deep breath.
The Doctor.
Who are you?
What? Not A St John D Caldera?
The neurologist.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. One of the great intellects of your generation.
What?
Some of the greatest intellects in the universe.
Skagra?
Yes, and too clever by seven-eighths. Who is he? Where does he come from?
What?
To do what?
He did? To do what?
What?
Why? What happened?
Shush. Easy, easy.
Easy. Shush, shush.
What! The whole of humanity.
What did he need?
Which mind?
What mind?
What was he called?
What was he called?
Salyavin?
Bristol? Bristol? Are you all right?
Good, good, it'll pass. You're fit.
Not much. Not enough to locate Skagra, just enough to frighten me out of my wits.
K9! Why aren't you back at
K9, try and keep it back.
Bristol?
You still feeling marvellous?
Right, give me ten seconds.
It's jammed!
Oh, ace. Ace.
Yes, and what better way to hide it than by living in it, you old sly boots.
Shush. Not so loud. He's just outside.
He's got Romana, he's got the Tardis, he's got the book. I thought you were dead, Professor.
Did you really?
Shada? Shada?
I never forget anything. I never forget. Well, that's right. I have forgotten. The Time Lords' prison planet. Now why would I have forgotten? Got it. Of course! Salyavin was imprisoned on Shada. Yes. Ask me who Salyavin is.
A great criminal. Unique mental powers. He had the capacity to project his mind into other minds, didn't he, Professor.
Oh no, no, no, no, no. Skagra, quite the opposite. Skagra had the capacity to take minds out of people, but he couldn't put minds into them. That's why he needs Salyavin in his sphere, and that's why he's going to Shada.
With Skagra's mind and Salyavin's in the sphere, Skagra will be omnipotent.
Yes, eventually, It might take thousands of years, but that wouldn't matter. His mind would be immortal. It would spread like a disease.
Skagra's mind. Not a pleasant thought.
Yes. But how? He's got a start on us and we don't know the way.
You followed the Tardis' space-time trail. Of course! Of course. Let's go!
Good! Good! Now, you two
Stay here.
Shush. I am not at liberty to explain. K9, you can come along, but no tangling with any Krargs, unless of course if you have to tangle with any Krargs.
Come on, K9.
Quick, come in, come in. Come on, K9. Sit down!
Got it!
Shush. Quiet, I'm thinking.
I'm thinking, and it depresses me. Skagra's little zombie gang have got the brain power of the greatest intellects of the Universe shared out among them. The Think Tank.
Never mind about that. Just believe me. All the minds that Skagra's stolen are now in the melting pot along with his own, and operating as one. And with the Professor's, I mean with Salyavin's mind in there too, they can now control anyone. They can control everyone. They'll be invincible.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes! Romana?
Romana, I want you to do something for me. Stand there. Romana, I want you to wear this.
Well, now I can think.
It'll be tricky.
Well, a touch.
As what?
Really? Well, I'll just have to be. I'll just have to be very brave, won't I.
Listen, I can do your part if you can do mine.
You're a hero. Remember? Clare?
Hold on very tight.
Ready?
Clare?
Hold tight. Now!
Ha ha! Got them. Well done, Romana.
No, we haven't got long. Clare?
Come over here and hold onto this, then.
Now, whatever you do, don't let go, because we are in for a very rough ride.
And twenty thirdly, out there in the space-time vortex, time and distance have no meaning, but here in this little, little room
Romana?
I want you to switch off the vortex shields in this small area here.
Come on, you can do it. I showed you how to do it. Just one little bit of timelessness and spacelessness over there behind the tea trolley.
I said behind the tea trolley, not in the middle of it.
Focus it! Now just one steady line, eh? One. Steady. Hold it. Hold it!
Phew. Right. Now this is a little trick I learnt from a space-time mystic in the Quantocks. He made it seem very, very easy.
Come in!
Her little homely dress, her favourite, cried the old man, pressing it to his breast and patting it with his shrivelled hand. She'll miss it when she wakes.
Huh!
Yes, it's mine.
Yes, really. Come on, Romana. Bye, Wilkin, Bristol, Keightley. Goodbye, Professor, we'll keep your secret.

Oh, my word! Come on, Jamie. Into the Tardis, quickly!
Shush, Jamie, a minute. Quiet! Oh! Oh dear!
Well, this sort of thing's happened before. The fluid links don't seem to be able to take the load.
Oh! Oh!
Yes.
Oh, my word, what a wonderful sight.
Don't worry, Jamie. We're safe in the Tardis.
Well
Well, no.
Well perhaps the fluid links have cooled down by now. That's a bit more power. Zoe, can you read off what that meter is registering, please?
Yes.
Ah.
Oh no.
Oh no!
Oh! This darn thing's stuck! Of all the stupid, idiotic!
If only I could unstick this stupid, idiotic. Oh, there we are. Oh.
No, but I've
I've stopped the fluid links from vapourising. We shan't suffocate.
Well there is an emergency unit, but, oh no, I can't possibly use that.
But it moves the Tardis out of the time space dimension. Out of reality!
Oh, I, oh all right.
Here we are. Now then, which end was? Yes. No, look, I can't possibly use this. We don't know what will happen.
Is there any reading on the meter, Zoe?
No. None of the meters are registering. Not one.
Yes, possibly. I'd better get working on the Tardis controls right away.
No. Why?
Well, because, well, we're nowhere. It's as simple as that. I'll be in the power room, Jamie.
What's happened?
Oh good, good.
Me? Worried? No. No. It's only the unknown that worries me, Zoe.
I don't know. But you see, the emergency unit is limited to a certain time simply because it's
You're interested in what's outside the Tardis now, aren't you?
Zoe, listen to me. If we move outside the Tardis, we step into a dimension about which we know nothing. We should be at the mercy of the forces outside time and space as we know it.
Zoe, we must stay in the Tardis.
But Jamie, it's not poss. You say you both saw different things?
So you both saw your homes?
Zoe? Oh, my word!
Zoe! Zoe!
No, Jamie. Don't you see? Those pictures that you and Zoe saw on the scanner were put there. Obviously put there to tempt you to go outside.
I don't know, but there's someone or something out there that wants us to go out of the Tardis.
I don't know.
Oh, no. That's the first warning. There isn't much more time.
No, Jamie! No!
Jamie! Jamie!
Oh. Oh no!
Who are you? Who are you? Where are you? What do you want with me?
No, no, I must fight. I must fight! I will fight!
No. I will fight. I will fight!
Jamie, Zoe, don't go! Don't go!
Who are you? What do you want?
No, I won't. I won't give in.
I can't let it happen. I can't.
Jamie? Zoe?
Jamie, Zoe, concentrate only on my words. Think of me. Think of the Tardis. They are the only real things here. Everything else is unreality. It is only in your minds. Now, concentrate. Come to me now. Now! Walk straight to the Tardis. Don't stop!
Come on. Keep walking to the Tardis. Come on. Don't look behind you! Now, go in. Go in!
Jamie, Zoe, go in before it's too late!
Go in!
Go in!
Shush, Jamie. Quiet.
How do you feel?
Nowhere.
All mental images, Jamie. Pure imagination.
I don't know. We've got to be careful. We've got to be very, very careful now.
Yes, possibly.
I, I, I don't know.
No, no, we're on our way all right, but the trouble is I don't know where to.
That's all right, Zoe. I don't think you could help it.
Well, I think whoever it was that was tempting you outside made it irresistible. Why, even I gave in when the voice said
I don't know. Perhaps there wasn't one. Perhaps it was just illusion.
Oh, yes, yes, yes. The Tardis is performing quite normally. Oh, that's odd.
Well, this meter's dropped below a thousand.
No. It just means that we're using more power than we're storing, but don't worry. We've got n emergency power booster unit here somewhere, if I can find the switch. Now. No. Oh dear. It's here somewhere.
Ah!
Yes. Yes, that's the one. Now just a little bit more power and, read off the meter for me, will you, Zoe?
Yes.
Good.
Fine.
Quiet, Jamie.
Yes.
Oh, no. Oh.
Good.
Fine.
Oh, let it creep up now. I don't want to blow the fluid links again.
Hmm?
Quiet, Jamie, quiet.
That sound. That vibration. It's alien.
I don't seem to be able to concentrate. Concentrate. Both of you, concentrate on something!
Read out the figures to me, Zoe, aloud. Go on.
Louder! Both of you, read them off!
Oh, it's getting stronger.
It's dragging me!
Concentrate! Both of you!
Oh, it's too strong!
It's too powerful!
Oh, it's too powerful.
No, I must fight!
I must fight!
I will fight!
Jamie. Zoe. Jamie. Fight. I must fight. Fight! Fight!
Where in time and space am I? Where are the others? Jamie? Zoe?
Jamie, is that you?
Zoe! Zoe?
All right, Zoe, just stay where you are and I'll see if I can find you. Hello? Call out to me!
Yes, all right, Jamie.
All right, Zoe.
All right, Jamie.
No! No! No! No! No! Not both together. One at a time! Now then, Jamie, you seem to be the nearer. You first. Count up to ten.
This is like exploring a maze in the dark.
Well, thank you, whoever you are.
{loud whisper) Jamie! Zoe!
Parlez-vous Francais?
Do you speak English by any chance?
Oh, good gracious me. Why didn't you say so at once?
Well, let's start at the beginning again, shall we? What did you say to me?
I think you must be making some mistake. Highwayman, indeed? Can you tell me when you were last in England?
We?
Oh, my dear sir, you and I are in the same boat.
No, no, no, unfortunately, no. Look, would you mind taking that pop gun away? It does unsettle me so.
Now how can I be a traitor when I don't even know where I am? Where am I?
That makes two of us, doesn't it. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Listen, I've lost my companions too. Two of them, a boy and a girl, Jamie and Zoe. You haven't seen them by any chance?
No, no. Well, I've got to find them. Perhaps you could help me, if you know your way around.
Who says so?
The Master?
Treason again. Really.
Oh but sir. Oh no, don't go. I wanted to ask you. (Gulliver has vanished.)
A hallucination? Oh, well. Jamie? Zoe!
Is that you, Zoe?
Who's that? Who are you?
Well. Well, well, well, well, well. How do you do?
Well, really, I don't think this is the time for riddles.
Oh very well. To get to the other side, or so I've always been led to believe. Now would you mind telling me
Neither, it's yellow.
I
Well, I
Well, Pinch Me, obviously.
Ow! No! Stop it! Don't do that! Now it's my turn to ask you questions. (The first boy holds a sword blade to the Doctor's throat.)
Huh?
S W O R D. Rearrange. Well, rearranged it makes W O R D S. Words.
Well, it's a dictionary. Words.
Suitable?
Words.
Jamie? Jamie? Is that you?
Oh, Jamie! It's just another trick! Hello? What's this? A safe? Locked, of course. And a wishing well. I wish. I wish I believed in wishing wells.
Hello. This is a puzzle, that's what it is.
Oh yes. Yes, I'm beginning to recognize this. Sort of picture writing. Let me see now. Jamie. Mist. Mist without the M or the T, i s. Is. Hand without the H, and. So we have Jamie is safe and well!
Oh. Oh, I've lost his face.
Hello. Oh, I see. I'm supposed to provide the face, am I? Very well. Now then. Yes. There we are.
Oh yes, that's his nose all right. And, yes. Yes.
Oh no, I've done it wrong! Oh!
But, but you're not Jamie.
Well, your face, it's different.
Well, look. Look in the mirror.
Well, it's the one you're stuck with for the moment.
I don't know. It's a particularly nasty trick on the part of the person who brought us here.
I don't know. Just a minute. If you really are Jamie, you should know what's happened. How did you get here?
Yes?
Off? Where to? Where've you been?
It did what?
Zoe? Where are you?
What? Come on, then!
Zoe!
Don't you see? It's not even a door at all. It's just a brick wall with a door painted on it.
Now let me think.
When
Is a door not a door?
No. When is a door not a door?
When it's ajar!
Go on, get her out.
Well, I'll tell you later. I think it's about time we got out of this wood.
Yes, well, you go on ahead, Jamie.
Well. Well, yes.
Well, I think we may be in a place where nothing is impossible. Come on.
Yes, good idea. Come along.
Up you go. Can you manage?
There's a foothold.
No, what?
This must be a world of words.
In for a pound. They're all sayings, proverbs.
Down you come. There's a foothold. Can you manage? That's right. Steady. There.
It's all right. Don't worry, I've met this gentleman before. He's a traveller like ourselves.
Delighted to meet you again, sir. Allow me to present my two companions. This is Zoe, and this is Jamie.
We're trying to find our way out of this wood.
Well, haven't you ever tried to escape from this place?
These tests, what's the point of them?
Oh, the Master again, eh? I suppose this army of robots works for the Master as well.
Oh, surely you've seen them.
Ah now, but surely. That's the sound they make. They're coming back!
We hide in among the trees. Quick! There's a J, there's room for two! Oh, thank goodness there's a letter C. You, sir, aren't you going to take cover?
Jamie, Zoe, don't you see? As far as he's concerned, they don't exist. He can't see them.
Sir.
I think the soldiers want us to go in the other direction.
Yes. Particularly dangerous toys too. Come along, let's go.
Well, we shall soon find out.
Shush! Listen.
It's not a horse. Look!
Keep quite still.
No!
Stand still.
Hold your ground!
No, stand still!
No!
No, it's not real. It's a legend. You mustn't believe in it, you mustn't. Say it doesn't exist. Say it.
Another test.
He challenged us to believe it.
Whoever it is who's setting up all these conjuring tricks.
Well, the unicorn appeared to be real until you said it wasn't. Then we were safe.
Yes, that was just the danger. Your belief was affecting me.
I don't know. A fantastic mind.
We've got to get out of this place.
Now it's all right, Zoe. Oh, come on, come on. If you want to play games, let's get on with it.
Well, I have to make up his face again.
Yes.
What? No. No, no. Well I, I was rushed. Now then. There we are.
All right, I know. There we are. One. Now then. Oh yes, that's his nose. You can't mistake his nose, can you. And.) (The Doctor reaches for a mouth then looks at Zoe. She smiles so he selects it and places it on Jamie's picture.)
There you are, you see.
Jamie.
Yes, look.
Yes. Come along. Let's go inside.
Just a moment.
Ah, yes, A ball of twine. Hmm. Oh yes. This must have been an invitation.
Well, it's the classical way of getting through a maze. Now, Jamie, tie that to the door will you.
Yes, I think we are.
Yes.
Don't break the thread. Come along.
Which way, do you think?
They both look equally unattractive to me.
Shush. How?
Shush, Jamie.
What it is to have an arithmetical brain. What do you want?
No, you stay here.
And Zoe and I will explore a little further. There must be another way out of this maze and I mean to find it.
Just a minute. I was rather expecting a welcoming committee. but perhaps I was wrong.
Ah yes, but there has been someone here. Not so long ago, either. Look.
Oh. Oh.
What?
Half man, half bull, yes.
Exactly, but I don't think we need be too alarmed. After all
As I was saying, as long as we're quite certain the minotaur is only a
But Zoe, it's a legend. Another mythical beast, like the unicorn.
No! The Minotaur is a mythical beast. Say it.
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid we made it too difficult for it to stay. Come on, let's go and find Jamie.
Yes. There's no sign of him. I'm sure he wouldn't have gone off without
What's that?
Well, he must be around here somewhere.
Oh. Oh, my dear sir.
You have a knack of turning up unexpectedly.
Of course. This, er, this person who controls this place, the Master?
Have you seen him?
Where might I find him?
Yes, now I think I understand. May I ask, sir, where you come from? Would it not be Nottingham?
Useful for those who intend to travel
As I always believed it would someday or other, my fortune to do.
Now I know who you are, sir. Your name is Lemuel Gulliver.
Yes, yes. Oh, I'm looking forward to a long talk with you one of these days.
Oh, I wouldn't dream of detaining you.
Farewell.
Well, he can only speak the words that Dean Swift gave him to say.
Of course he is. Don't you understand? This world that we've tumbled into is a world of fiction. Unicorns, minotaur, Gulliver's travels, they're all alive here.
I'm not sure I understand that yet. Come along, let's find Jamie. You'd better put this on.
I imagine there must be at least one more test. I wonder what it'll be?
A statue.
Yes, only the unicorn was alive first and then became a statue. Only this time
Have a care, Zoe. I have a feeling the situation is going to be reversed.
Medusa!
Now, we know what we have to do, Zoe.
Zoe, we have to say Medusa doesn't exist.
Zoe, Medusa is a myth. If you believe it her, she can turn us both to stone. Now, Zoe, say it. The Medusa is a myth. Say it!
No!
No, don't look in her eyes. Don't look!
The Medusa does not exist. You must believe that.
No, no, that's marble. Think of her as a marble statue. A legend.
A sword!
Maybe it's another trap?
No. How can I kill something that doesn't exist?
No, wait. Perseus, of course. A mirror. There. Look at her reflection in the mirror. Look. Can you see her?
This is how Perseus escaped. He looked at her reflection in his polished shield. There's no danger in the reflection.
It's safe now. You can look now. The statue has become a statue again.
Oh yes, that's the citadel all right. The question is, how do we get up there.
Zoe, duck!
What?
What, with that thing? What sort of a gun is that?
Rubbish. Such a weapon is scientifically impossible. It doesn't exist.
Well, that seems to take care of that, doesn't it.
But I don't. I've never heard of him.
Oh Zoe, run!
What are you doing? No, please, I'm sure we can talk this over.
Zoe.
Be careful.
Don't do anything rash.
Well, well take us there, there's a good chap.
The strip? Oh, a strip cartoon of the year two thousand?
Yes, but I hardly had time to follow the strip cartoons.
Well thank you, thank you, Mister. What did you say his name was?
Ah yes, Mister Karkus. Thank you.
Come along.
Why not? It's the usual way.
I am ze Karkus.
Shush. Year two thousand, comic strip creation, the hourly telepress.
What happened?
Yes, I thought they'd turn up sooner or later. Yes, it's a simple photoelectric cell. We just. I'd better lift you over it.
There we are.
Oh, my word.
Oh, I'm not leaving yet. I'm here on business.
Why do you say that?
Yes. Well, I see. I'll think it over very carefully.
No, of course not. I said I'd think it over. Well, I've thought it over. We're staying on and fighting on.
Oh, yes?
Let's have a look.
(reads.) Cancel. Doctor test report failure. Oh, I think I'm beginning to understand.
Well, when someone writes about an incident after it's happened, that is history.
But when the writing comes first, that's fiction. If we'd have fallen into the Master's trap, we would have become fiction.
Zoe, where are you going?
Don't go
No, not through there! (Zoe walks through the archway and the alarm sounds.)
Gulliver's not real, we are.
No need to hide.
Let them find us.
Yes, why not? We'll ask for an interview with the Master.
Are you looking for us by any chance? We demand an interview with the Master.
Said the spider to the fly. Come along.
Where are you?
Responsible, huh? To someone else?
What is the purpose of all these tests?
No, I can't say that I. Wait a minute, a serial in a boys' magazine?
The Ensign.
You are a writer.
Or is all this in charge of you?
I see. That means that you are virtually a prisoner.
No, I need to find out more.
Jamie, I think it will be safer if we all stick together.
You were about to answer my question. Are you a prisoner here?
I see, yes. And only an Earthman type creature has the power to create fiction. The power to imagine.
What is this intelligence you serve, and why was I brought me here?
And you want me to
I refuse!
I refuse. I shall make that decision for myself.
What does that mean?
Oh, no. Jamie! Zoe!
What have you done to them?
You really would do that?
I see. How very ingenious.
No! My answer is still no!
I have yet to see a robot that can climb.
Oh, Zoe! Jamie!
The Master said you been turned into
Yes, you've said that, Jamie.
Is some thing wrong, Zoe?
But you keep saying the same things.
Then it's true. They're not real. They've been turned into fiction.
Well, what's this?
The master tape! I wonder. Perhaps if I were to create a few immortal words of fiction of my own. Yes, it's worth trying.
Oh, what I need is the strength of Karkus!
Oh thank you, my dear sir. Perhaps you could release this for me.
Well no, I don't actually want it. You see, I want to get down here somehow.
Oh, thank you.
Jamie. Jamie, Zoe. You are being controlled! Jamie, listen. Listen! Oh, it's no use.
Oh, thank you.
Oh! Oh yes, of course, you are the Princess Rapunzel.
No. No, I'm afraid not, but would you mind if I used your hair to get down there.
Thank you very much. Now then, where can we attach the?
Ah yes, of course.
"The enemy had been finally defeated by the Doctor. No, no, I can't say that. If I say that. I nearly fell for it, didn't I. Another two seconds and I should have turned myself into fiction!
I'm very obliged to you both.
Jamie and Zoe. I left them here. Where are they? Jamie! Zoe!
Please, please. I must think. There must be some way out of this. There's just got to be.
I only wish there was.
The Tardis, safe and sound, by all that's wonderful.
The time?
But how did you find the Tardis?
Yes! Yes of course we must. Just as I was thinking that all was over.
Oh, Jamie! Zoe!
What's happening?
To what purpose?
And it's people?
Sausages. Man will just become like a string of sausages, all the same.
Leaving the Earth undamaged and uninhabited for you to take over.
If I cooperate.
So the computer feeds off my thoughts, does it?
Then it will create what I think.
Are you so sure? You couldn't control my mind before, and you certainly can't control it now.
No! You've given me equal power. It's now a battle of wits between me and you.
Jamie, Zoe, can you hear me? Think for yourselves. Don't be afraid. You can open the book. Go on, you can do it.
Don't worry about fiction. Hang on to real life. You've got to get out.
Jamie, Zoe, concentrate. You've got to get out of there. Now push. Harder! Harder!
Splendid, splendid.
No! Jamie, Zoe, run!
No! Suddenly, the Karkus came to their rescue!
He raised his anti-molecular disintegrator gun and destroyed the soldiers.
But all the power had been used up on the soldiers and it was useless. Oh, you'll have to do better than that.
But wait.
He found himself face to face with the fearless musketeer and fearless swordsman D'Artagnan.
Jamie, Zoe, get away from there.
Cancel D'Artagnan. Substitute Sir Lancelot in full armour.
Oh. Oh my goodness. As the White Robots advanced on the Doc. No, I can't say that. I can't say that.
Zoe! Jamie! Oh my goodness.
Yes. Come on, Jamie, give me hand with him.
Don't argue, Jamie. Give me hand.
Are you all right, sir?
No, you were kidnapped, just like we were. They've been using your mind.
That depends how efficient the White Robots are. Their last order was to destroy. Let's just hope they're destroying one another.
You can't blow up a fictional character, Zoe.
Well, we'll just have to hope that the destruction of the computer returns us all to reality. And you, my dear sir.
Well, I hope so.
Well, we shall soon know. Hang on! Here it comes.

There you are, K9. The first segment of the Key to Time. A job well done.
Yes, yes, yes. The others will be easy. A piece of cake.
Mmm.
That's what I said, K9. Piece of cake.
Good morrow, Romana. That looks interesting.
What are you reading?
Capsule? What kind of a word is that? If you mean Tardis, why don't you say Tardis?
Not on the syllabus. I don't know what the Academy's coming to these days.
Really? Like what?
Now you're being frivolous.
Oh, no!
How paralysingly dull, boring and tedious.
Yes. Calufrax.
Yes. Mean little planet. Still. Listen, why don't you watch while I set the coordinate on this vintage veteran of mine? Maybe you'll learn something.
Hmm?
What about it?
No, no, no. I never bother about that. Complete waste of time.
Listen, have you any idea how long I've been operating this Tardis?
Right! Is it really that long? My, how time flies.
What?
Oh. Absolute rubbish.
Now, I'll show you a really smooth materialisation without a multiloop anything. Watch this. Calufrax, here we come.
She won't materialise.
Of course, K9, of course. Ow!
No, no, no, no. Nothing at all.
Not so. I am perfectly capable of admitting when I am wrong.
Yes. Only this time I wasn't. There was definitely something out there jamming our materialisation field.
Yes. Yes, that's what it was. Yes. Whatever it was, it wasn't a multiloop whatsit or anything else to do with that manual.
What, by the book?
Yes, all right, all right. You do it your way.
You'll see. There's definitely something out there jamming our materialisation field.
Won't make a scrap of difference.
Look out, K9. Hold on.
Good.
That was very, very good. Wasn't that good, K9?
Oh, terribly good. Listen, I think she's going to be all right. Very all right.
Oh, all right then. Let's get it over with. Horrible place. Cold, wet, icy. No life of any sort. Boring.
What? Calufrax? You have made an enormous mistake. You've probably, you've probably missed it by a couple of million light years!
I wonder what's biting him?
That's strange.
Can't be right. It is right. But it can't be, can it?
Well, according to these space time coordinates, we have arrived at precisely the right point in space at precisely the right time.
But to the wrong planet.
This isn't Calufrax.
I haven't got the faintest idea. All I do know is that this planet wasn't here when I tried to land.
Yes.
Never trust gimmicky gadgets.
It's all right. It just means someone's coming.
No, no, excuse me. I'll do it.
Excuse me. Would you take me to your leader? What we'd like to know, you see, is what planet?
Halt! What we
You're not doing very well, K9.
No.
What?
Nonsense! Making contact with an alien race is an immensely skilled and delicate operation. It calls for tact and experience. What would she know about it?
Is she? What's that got to do with it.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much. Excuse me.
Sweets. You eat them. Go on.
Er, excuse me! What I'd like to know. Where did you get those jelly babies?
Where?
Look, good looks are no substitute for a sound character. Did he say anything about omens?
Really?
I think that these stones are genuine. What do you think, K9?
Oh, thank you very much. And what colour are the amethysts?
Affirmative.
Extraordinary. The place is littered with them. Diamonds, Andromedan bloodstones, gravel, more diamonds. Don't they have street sweepers here?
Diamonds and rubies not valuable?
Oolian?
Oolian? Now that is rare. That's one of the most precious stones in the galaxy. It only occurs naturally in two places that I know of. Qualactin and Bandraginus Five. Bandraginus Five? Where have I heard that mentioned recently?
Yeah, hold it up to the light. People have murdered for that beauty, ravaged empires for it, and lying in the streets exactly where I wasn't expecting to find it. I wonder where Calufrax got to?
Excuse me, have you seen Calufrax?
It's sort of planet, about fourteen thousand kilometres across, oblate spheroid.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a planet called Calufrax.
It's about fourteen thousand kilometres across, it's an oblate spheroid and it's covered in ice. Excuse me, excuse me. Has anybody seen a planet called Calufrax? Funny, nobody's seen it.
Well, someone's around, anyway.
Over there? You stay here. I'll go and see.
Excuse me, are you sure this planet's meant to be here?
He's in a state of shock.
What, every time?
Hmm. Tell me about this Captain. Pleasant sort of chap, is he?
Really? That's a very interesting observation.
Mentiads? I've heard that somewhere before.
No, no, no, it's all right. It's all right, it's a friend of mine. Aren't you a friend of mine, K9?
Now then, tell me about the Mentiads.
Pralix, what do the Mentiads want of you? What is it?
How long have you stunned them for, K9?
Good, good. Evil zombies? Terrible powers?
Pralix. Pralix, what is it?
Pralix, can you hear my voice?
Pralix. Pralix, can you hear my voice? What is it? Hello? Hello. Are you by any chance the Mentiads? Well, it's just that you look like Mentiads to me.
You see, what I thought was that er
Shush.
What hit me?
I wasn't asking you. What hit me, K9?
Five four three point seven two?
(to camera) That's what I thought.
Don't worry, don't worry, I'll find him.
Do you know where the Mentiads live?
They? Who's they?
You're not frightened?
You just didn't get round to it, is that it?
So will I.
Not now, K9, not now. Now, K9, can you track the Mentiads by their psychospore?
Excellent, excellent. Right, who's coming? Kimus? Mula? Balaton?
All right, all right. Romana? Romana? Where's Romana?
What?
Why didn't you?
It just means two rescue attempts. After all, Romana has the tracer, you see. Now, where will they have taken her?
No one?
Right. Heads we go after Romana first, tails we go after Pralix first, hmm?
Heads.
Two kings on Aldebaran Three.
Oh yes, it is. If my guess is correct, Romana's in much greater danger than Pralix. Now, how do we get to this Bridge?
But Mula
No, no, no, you stay here.
I need you here. It'll be all right. K9?
I'm putting Mula in your charge. Take her to the Mentiads but look after her. Is that clearly understood?
Off you go. We'll follow along later.
How do we get to it?
One of those, is it? How do the guards get there?
Aircars?
Aircars?
Help me borrow it.
Well, I don't mind going first class, do you?
Come on.
Bye, bye!
You're not free yet.
Tell me about those mines.
Who goes down them? Do you go down?
Mentiads?
No one?
What happens when they run out?
What, just like that?
Wrong? It's an economic miracle. Of course it's wrong.
What lights?
Do you mean the stars?
Might be the way to the Bridge.
No. I save planets, mostly, but this time I think I've arrived far, far too late.
Well?
Huh. Impossible? That means it'll take seventy three seconds. We can ill afford it. Move over.
Well, of course I can open it. It's just a question of how.
I haven't got the faintest idea.
Hmm.
I haven't finished yet. Bent hairpin. The more sophisticated the technology, the more vulnerable it is to primitive attack. People often overlook the obvious.
Shall we go?
Yes, it certainly looks like it.
Come on.
Kimus, I want you to do something very important for me.
Go out to the aircar, fetch the guard's gun
Stand outside on guard.
No, no, no, no, no. That's the most valuable thing you can do. There are so many things here you can't understand, and a linear induction corridor is one of them.
See you later.
I'll never be cruel to an electron in a particle accelerator again.
Good heavens. Ah, of course. It isn't a linear induction corridor. It must work by neutralising inertia.
A lift?
Hello, hello.
(to Fibuli) I'm the Doctor. Delighted to meet you. Heard so much about what a splendid chap you are. I see, I see you've met my assistant, Romana. Getting on like a house on fire, are you? She's a lovely girl. What a splendid place you've got here. Are you having a spot of bother?
Such hospitality. I'm underwhelmed.
My manners are impeccable.
Macromat field integrator. Has the whizz-bang gone wrong?
And the amblicyclic photon? Would you mind if I examined its locus?
Locus.
Whoa. Look at that, Romana.
No, actually. Not like this.
Really. I suspected something of the kind. Come on, let's look busy.
Shush.
(loud) Gravitic anomalising input reading, nine point five. (sotto) Nine point five.
I mean I had my suspicions.
More or less, yes.
Well, I just put one point seven nine five three seven two and two point two oh four six two eight together.
Four!
Romana?
We are in very, very, very great danger.
Yes.
The Captain is a very clever and very dangerous man. He's playing with us. He wants to find out why we've come here.
Is the only way to find it. What does the tracer say?
What? That's it, then.
The answer. Romana, we've stumbled on one of the most heinous crimes ever committed in this galaxy. We've got to get out of here and get out of here quickly. Come on.
Ahem. Er, Captain? Your magnifactoid eccentricolometer's definitely on the blink.
Sabotage? Captain, it's more than my reputation's worth.
Or my life, as you say. Yes, yes. We've got to go back to our own ship now and prepare some special equipment.
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, we have a special lock fitted to the Tardis door, and it requires the physical presence of both of us to open it. That's clever, don't you think?
It's a pleasure to work with you, Captain. Well, come on. Don't just stand there, escort us.
Standing around all day looking tough must be very wearing on the nerves, hmm?
I said, standing around all day looking tough must be very wearing on the nerves!
Long hours, violence, no intellectual stimulation.
And now this happens.
(to fallen guard) I'd give it up if I were you. Kimus?
We've got a lot of travelling to do.
To investigate your miraculous mines. Come on.
Huh. I can see there wouldn't be much incentive.
You know, I think that'll work. Let's see.
Right. Now hold on very tight.
About three miles beneath the surface of Zanak, I'd say.
Yes.
Yes. And wet and icy. Ah! Romana, this entire planet's hollow.
Yes, hollow. Hollow! Can't you work it out? Go on, take a look. Go on, look. Look! You all right?
Come here and listen. Now listen, Kimus. The reason the stars in your sky change is because they don't.
No. Your entire planet jumps through space
Yes, those engines. Huge enough to dematerialise an entire hollow planet, flip it halfway across the galaxy and rematerialise it round its chosen prey.
Yes, like a huge fist. It's one huge mining machine that mines planets, extracts all the valuable minerals and leaves the rubble behind.
Is the planet we originally came looking for.
Calufrax.
Buried inside Zanak, the pirate planet, and having the goodness sucked out of it.
Whole other worlds.
The oolian stone I picked up in the street. Bandraginus Five! I knew I'd heard that name somewhere before. I remember now. About a hundred years ago it disappeared without trace. A planet of a thousand million souls, Captain fodder.
Yes?
Yes, I thought so.
I thought as much.
Exciting, isn't it.
Hello, K9. Surprised to see us?
There you are. Didn't I say he'd be amazed?
Its name's the Captain. You know that. Why haven't you kicked him out?
A gestalt. A telepathic gestalt!
Yes. Zanak's just a shell of a planet, a complete hollow.
Yes, but very rarely empty. Now, listen. There are vast transmat engines hidden underneath the Captain's mountain.
Yes, but you don't notice that, you see, because you're part of it. Now listen. At almost the same moment it vanishes, it rematerialises in another part of the galaxy around another, slightly smaller, planet.
Yes. So your planet
Yes. So your planet
Yes. Having materialised around the other planet, smothers it, crushes it, and mines all the mineral wealth out of it.
Yes.
Yes. The omens mean the death of another planet.
So Zanak was a happy, prosperous planet?
Come on, that's not necessarily evil. I've known hundreds of people who've lived for hundreds
What?
Shush, K9, shush. Please carry on.
Hmm. Tell me, how did he arrive?
And needed pretty extensive surgery, by the look of him. I wonder who did that?
Not now, K9, not now. Go on.
Yes, well, they would for someone who was telepathic.
Yes. Yes, I do. You were absorbing what you would call the life force from the plundered planets.
Well, er, well, it's quite difficult to explain simple terms, but basically, Romana?
Oh, enormous.
Right.
That's right. You Mentiads were absorbing all that power into your brains.
What is it, K9?
Well, they say you can fool some of the people all of the time. Let's see, shall we?
I really must stop doing this. It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
Hands up.
Have I told you my plan? No more janis thorns. No more janis thorns! I think it should work really quite well. I think. Argh!
Good morning.
You won't get away with it, you know.
At the moment, nothing at all, but it does my morale no end of good just to say it. I've been tied to pillars by better men than you, Captain.
Vicious? Ha. Don't panic, Kimus. Don't panic.
What are you doing it for, Captain? It doesn't make sense and you know it. I can understand the life of a full-blooded pirate, the thrill, the danger and the derring-do, but this? Hidden away in your mountain retreat eating other people's perfectly good planets, where's the derring-do in that?
You're just trying to shut me up. You can't kill me while I'm helpless.
No, you can't, because you're a warrior, and it's against the warrior's code. You should have thought of that before you tied me up.
Hard to listen, isn't it, Captain, when someone's got a finger on a nerve. What is it you're really up to? What do you want? You don't want to take over the universe, do you? No. You wouldn't know what to do with it, beyond shout at it.
He said release me.
What are they? Tombstones? Memorials to all the worlds you've destroyed?
You come here on the wanton destruction you've wreaked on the universe.
Did you just say the entire remains of the worlds themselves?
That's impossible! That amount of matter in so small a space would undergo instant gravitational collapse and form a black hole!
What? But Zanak would be dragged into a gravitational whirlpool
Then it's the most brilliant piece of astro-gravitational engineering I've ever seen. The concept is simply staggering. Pointless, but staggering.
Appreciate it? Appreciate it? What, you commit mass destruction and murder on a scale that's almost inconceivable and you ask me to appreciate it? Just because you happen to have made a brilliantly conceived toy out of the mummified remains of planets
What's it for? Huh? What are you doing? What could possibly be worth all this?
Would you like to put me down?
That should be fun.
Kimus, are you all right?
For goodness sake, get him down. He hasn't done you any harm. Captain?
We're on the Bridge.
That's your beloved Captain.
Shush. Don't make any noise. The Mentiads are on their way here and he's got no power against their psychic strength.
Oh, it looks like a psychic interference transmitter.
Well, it's a sort of machine for neutralising psychic power.
Nonsense, Captain, nonsense. To make that machine work you'd need a collection of the most rare crystals.
Oh, yes. Voolium.
Madranite one five.
And as far as I know, they occur naturally on only one planet, and that's
Calufrax.
My biorhythms must be at an all time low.
They are?
No, no, no. Don't, don't.
Come back, K9! Come back!
Come on.
Never mind about that. Let's find another way out.
Get back.
Here it is.
Yes.
Never.
Come on.
No, don't. Those are the time dams.
Not completely, but they can slow down the flow of time in the space between, given enough energy.
That's your beloved queen, Xanxia.
Oh no, she's not. She's suspended in the last few seconds of life.
No, she can't.
No. Not while she's between those two things there.
To find enough energy to fuel those dams, you'd need to ransack entire planets.
Yes. There must be something more to it than that.
Yes. Would you go to those lengths just to stay alive?
No, not in that condition, but in what condition? What? Shush.
K9! Look at that.
You're a good dog, K9. A good dog? You're a hero!
Isn't that marvellous?
I've got a job for you two. Now listen. Over there, there's a service elevator. It must go down to the engine room.
So? So you and K9 are going down in the lift to the engine room to sabotage the engines, all right?
Good. Off you go then.
I'm going to see to the Captain.
Ready, Captain?
All right, all right, all right, I give up.
Yes, I'm afraid I seem unable to break the habit.
My colleagues (thumb down)
I'm sorry about that, but it was becoming an infernal nuisance.
Er, Captain, I think you'd better hear what I have to say first. Ahem. I mean, I think when you hear what I've got to say, you'll change your mind.
Please listen.
Please, listen!
You can't be serious. Is he?
Captain, you don't realise what you're doing. If you just listen to me
But please.
But
Hello, everybody.
Sorry I couldn't make the jump myself. I've got a terrible head for heights.
I've discovered your little secret. We're not all quite as we seem.
Neat little machine, isn't it. And the image it projects might almost be real.
Hello, Doctor.
Hello. How are you?
Oh, terribly well. Can't complain.
Goodbye.
Bye, bye.
And just as I can switch off that image of myself, I can also switch off the image of another apparently real person.
So, Xanxia, the tyrant queen of Zanak.
What about the real you? That wizened old body in the time dams back there.
Oh, no, no, no, not yet it isn't. Your new body's based on a cell projection system, I think.
Ah, but it's still unstable, isn't it? You're still dependant on the last few seconds of life in the old body.
It won't work, you know. Believe me. I'm an old hand at regenerations. It can't be done that way. Those time dams back there, they just won't work.
Bafflegab, my dear. I've never heard such bafflegab in all my lives.
Yes.
Ow! Ah, now we're getting somewhere, aren't we.
No, Captain. Captain, listen to me. This concerns you. You're being used, you know. You're being used by her just to do her dirty work. And what's your reward, Captain? Eternal life?
Enough to know it can't be sustained by those time dams back there.
It never will. Not ever.
Are wrong.
Inevitable, because they are based on a false promise.
What next, suns? It's no good. The energy needs of the time dams increase exponentially. There just isn't enough energy in the universe to keep them going for ever. In the end, you'll die.
I just don't think it's worth all that effort. What do you think, Mister Fibuli? Captain? What do you think, Captain.
Ah, so that's how you control him.
PJX one eight? But, well, that's quartz.
Yes, but from where? Where?
Earth? Earth? Do you really mean to go on with this madness? But Captain, Earth is an inhabited planet.
Billions and billions of people. You can't be that insane.
You can't possibly succeed. The Mentiads will destroy you.
What, that?
It's all right, I'll close it.
Kimus and K9?
No, I sent them to sabotage the engines. The planet's about to jump again.
Yes, I know. I know. They've got a psychic interference transmitter on the Bridge.
Where's K9?
Listen, you and Mula stay here and cover us. The rest of us, the engine room.
I don't know.
Come on, K9, we need you.
Listen, K9, that's all right. The Mentiads can still open the door if you can set up counter interference in the psychic plane. Wavelength three three seven point nine eight microbars. Can you do that?
That's all right, K9. You're still my best friend.
What? What?
Oh, K9.
He said there's a power cable right behind me. Quick, open his inspection hatch.
That's it. K9, can you divert any of this current into your frequency projectors?
Good boy. Keep it going, K9.
What? Enough to open a door?
More power, K9, more power.
Yes.
That's right. And if we couldn't materialise then neither can Zanak. Quick, back to the Tardis. K9, keep generating power. Pralix.
Read my mind. What can you see?
Right.
Right, right. Now, whatever happens, you keep concentrating on my mind. Come on, Romana. We've got a planet to save.
A bent fork.
I haven't the vaguest idea.
Cover your heads. We're almost there.
Get off now.
No, no, no, wait a minute. The inertia neutraliser. You know, I think the conservation of momentum is a very important law in physics, don't you?
I don't think anyone should tamper with it, do you?
No, nor do I.
Newton's revenge. Come on.
Old Isaac? Friend of mine on Earth. He discovered gravity. Well, I say he discovered gravity. I had to give him a bit of a prod.
Climbed up a tree.
Dropped an apple on his head.
No, no, he told me to clear off out of his tree. I explained it to him afterwards at dinner.
Going in to land.
This is the most dangerous manoeuvre the Tardis has ever attempted. Don't take it personally, old girl, just try and survive. Now, Earth coordinates?
Good. Multiloop stabiliser, synchronic feedback.
That's a good point. Now, listen, Zanak could try to dematerialise at any moment. We've got to be spot on. You'll man the warp oscilloscope and the gravity dilation meter.
They'll both peak when Zanak goes into demat and remat mode. Then brace yourself.
It'll go on getting worse until one of us explodes or the Mentiads raise that door.
I'm opening a communications channel.
Pralix? Pralix, can you hear me?
Romana?
Switch off the Tardis forcefield.
I know. Do it.
And you.
Pralix? Pralix, do you have the strength to raise the door yet?
Spanner? Spanner. That's it! A spanner in the works. Pralix, forget the door. Can you project your minds beyond it?
There, on the floor.
Now, follow my movements. Macrovectoid particle analyser. Omnimodular thermacron. There! Megaphoton discharge link.
Hit it.
You can never relax for a moment in this job.
Yes, the question is, will we ever be able to do anything else again? Shall we try and materialise?
Come on.
Yes, that's her, the old harpy.
Yes. Any interference in the time dam field, though, would trigger off an explosion that would blast us off this planet.
I think we adapt the Captain's plan.
The Captain's trophy room. Well, what do you think?
Yes, obviously. All the forces cancel each other perfectly, otherwise Poof!
Yes. Let that be a lesson to you, my girl. Never take anything at its face value.
The Captain's plan, we must be able to use it.
Yes.
Right.
Here they are, all perfectly balanced out.
Right.
And it wouldn't have worked anyway.
Yes, but Calufrax isn't.
Is not a normal planet. It's an artificially metricised structure consisting of a substance with a variable atomic weight.
Is the second segment of the Key to Time.
Try it now.
The tracer. You have still got it?
What?
There.
Not if I do something immensely clever.
No, Captain, don't! Don't do it! It won't work!
No, please, I can explain everything.
No one else come in. No one else!
Well, the Captain certainly is, but Xanxia's another matter. You'd all better get out of here. This place is pretty unstable. Get down to the foot of the mountain.
It's all right, I'll follow on later. Off you go.
Phew. Ah, look, this might be a bit tricky. I want you to go and find K9, take him back to the Tardis and wait for me there.
Well, I've got a couple of things to do here. Please go. Please go. Go.
Now, Captain, let me see.
You'll never believe it.
All right, I will. I've switched the Captain's circuits around to create a hyperspatial force shield around the shrunken planets, then I put his dematerialisation control into remote mode.
Precisely.
What? Well, first I dematerialise the Tardis, then I make Zanak dematerialise for a millisecond or two, then I invert the gravity field of the hyperspatial forceshield and drop the shrunken planets
Exactly.
Well, I would have thought that was perfectly obvious. They expand in an instant to fill a hollow space and bang.
Well, naturally, Calufrax is flung off into the space time vortex and we pick it up later in the Tardis.
Quite ingenious? It's brilliant. It's fantastic!
Fantastic. Right. Here we go then. There.
Clever, eh?
Yes.
Me?
Bridge and time. K9?
Oh, it's a bit crude, but immensely satisfying.
Come on, Romana.
I don't see why not. It's entirely up to you. You've got to make this world a better place to live in. You've got plenty of material wealth, but there are other things. The other lead, Romana.
Thank you. (to Kimus and Mula) Now, I think this is a good place in the universe to settle down. You've got reasonable sun, good neighbours and some quite convenient stars for when you get round to ordinary space travel. I think you're going to be all right here.
Good. Next. (the Mentiads) What I want to know is, am I going to blow up that Bridge, or are you?
Good. I'll get out of the way while you concentrate.
That was very satisfying. Come on, Romana, we've got a job to do.

Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside, I do like to be beside the sea.
Well, you won't need those for a start.
You can't sink on Florana.
The water's effervescent. The bubbles support you.
All right, but you wait until you've seen Florana. I always come back from Florana feeling a hundred years younger.
Ah, the air is like a magic potion.
And the beauty of it all is
We seem to have got a mains power
I'm not sure. I'll cut in the emergency units.
Well, that's a relief. If they hadn't worked, we'd have been in real trouble.
Oh, there you are. Well, one thing's certain. We've landed.
Sarah, the scanner, quickly. There could be enough charge to operate it.
Only fog. Fascinating, isn't it?
Well, perhaps that's what's put the Tardis out of action.
Yes, of course.
Hardly. Listen.
Yes, exactly. Not a click, not a tick. Nothing. The Tardis is a living thing, thousands of instruments. Its energy sources never stop.
Sarah, there's a torch in that cabinet. Get it for me, will you?
Good.
Well, don't worry. I've got an oil lamp in here. That should be all right. Yes, there it is.
On the contrary, I'm going to light it and illumine us.
There we are.
Well, we'll have to get it adjusted. That's better. Right now, let's see where we are.
Here, hold this for a minute, will you? Normally this door is power operated. We'll have to work it by hand. Where's that crank handle? There it is.
Now bring the light over here, please.
A bit more. Is that enough?
Good, right, that's enough.
Oh. Now follow me. Let's take a look.
All right?
Well, this is no ordinary fog.
It must be perfectly obvious to you, Sarah, that we've gone ever so slightly astray, so sarcasm of that
Ah, it's all right. It's just rock.
No, some sort of life form that has become petrified, I should think.
No, I doubt if anything has grown here for centuries.
Well, if the rest of the planet's like this, then life here certainly doesn't depend on photosynthesis.
Some power emanating from this planet has stopped the Tardis's energy banks. Now logically, that power can hardly be of geological origin.
Yes, exactly.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid we can't fix it. Not unless we discover the source of the power that's blocking us.
I've no idea.
Until we can discover the source of that energy loss, yes.
Well, I think to begin with, we must check the immediate area, don't you?
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl, go and put something warm on.
What happened to him?
In a roundabout sort of way, yes.
Well, it would have saved me a few bruises if we'd shaken hands the first time we'd met. Hello, how do you do?
Lieutenant? Are you a military expedition?
Master of Science?
Back to the Tardis. That's my spaceship. I have a young companion with me, Sarah Jane Smith. I only hope she had the good sense to stay inside after I was captured.
It's not far from here.
Yes, if. Sarah's rather headstrong. By now, I expect she's out looking for me.
What forbidden city?
Well, what is this place? Where is it?
Tell me, what's the purpose of your expedition?
Parrinium?
Well, forgive me, but what do you want it for?
Well, here and there, one place and another. Well, I am a little out of touch, I'll admit.
And parrinium will halt this disease?
I see.
Do you happen to know if that message was received?
I think we can safely assume that no help is coming. So, might I make a suggestion
We'll know soon enough.
Daleks!
Well, well, well. Daleks without the power to kill. How does it feel?
And if I don't, what will you do? Your weapons are totally useless, affected by the same energy blackout that has stranded us.
You're not in a position to give any orders. No, no, we're all in this together. All equal, all powerless.
Well, they may agree with your plan, Captain, but I advise you, don't trust them.
They're brilliant technicians. It was their inventive genius that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe, remember that.
Well, whatever they're going to do, I hope they decide quickly.
I think they'll go for it. Mind you, they haven't much choice, but I must warn you again. Don't you trust them an inch.
Yes. Several of the planets the Daleks have colonised are suffering from the same disease. They're dying in millions. Now they need that chemical just as badly as you do. That's why I think they'll cooperate.
Well, have you decided?
A very wise decision.
Take cover!
It's no good. We can't help him.
Quick, come on. Out, come on.
Come on, down here. Which way did they come from?
Down!
Our only chance is that it's a small group, then we might make a break for it.
Just a suggestion, that's all.
So it was a large group.
What's going on over there?
Certainly, when the only alternative to living is dying. All right. Come on, let's get it over with.
Sarah! What are you doing with her?
I have a feeling it might be better if you did not associate yourself too closely with us. I think we're the flies in a jar of very nasty ointment.
Well, I'm afraid that what they had planned for you has merely been postponed. I think they'll be two of us in the next performance.
No, that's pure wishful thinking, Jill. The Daleks won't give us any loyalty and I don't expect too much help from your space chums either.
Right, come on, jump! Jump!
Right, come on. (a few steps along) Stay there.
The Daleks don't seem to be following us.
Hardly. They're probably the most technically advanced and ruthless life form in the galaxy.
Because they're only half robot, Sarah. Inside each of those shells is a living, bubbling lump of hate.
No, they move by psychokinetic power.
Do you?
Well, that seemed to be the general idea, yes.
Yes, I knew that thought would occur to you sooner or later.
Yes. And it's not one of my favourites. In fact I don't care for it at all.
Oh, very well. I think they expect that sacrifice to be completed by something else. Something that lives down this tunnel.
Yes. Some sort of subterranean wind effect, I should think.
Myself, chiefly.
I think I'll make a short reconnaissance down this tunnel here. Alone.
Look, Sarah, I don't want anything creeping down behind me and blocking off my retreat, now do I? With you here on watch you can give me a warning.
You're in a perfectly safe place here. You've got three different ways to run.
I think I'll just go down it for about half a mile. If it holds any promise, I'll be right back. All right?
Thank you.
Oh, good shot, sir.
A hit! Yes, a palpable hit!
All right. All right, all right, all right, all right. Just a moment, just a moment! I've just had a face to face confrontation with a rather nasty root. It obviously wasn't very fond of me but it positively hated the Dalek.
Yes, it must have been one of those sort of underground support systems for the city, I should imagine.
The root, one.
Dalek, nil. In fact, this was about the only part of it that was left undamaged.
Sarah? Who are your shining friends?
You first. Go on, Sarah.
I really must go on a diet one of these days. Give me your hand!
Come on.
It's all right. He seems to have gone. Is anyone hurt?
We can't sit around underground forever. There are things we must do.
Well, get the power back into our spaceships, for one thing. And for another, do everything we can to help that Earth mission ship.
You take it from me, Sarah. The moment they cease to be of use to the Daleks, they'll wipe them out without a qualm.
What destroyed their power, war?
I see. So the city became an entity, though greater and more powerful than the many small parts that had created it.
Yet you don't fear the city, Bellal. Why?
Yes. Well, I think the time has come to do something about this city.
You say that markings like these are cut into the walls of the city?
No, not fully. But I do have a rough idea of what they're intended to convey. You see, I've seen them before.
On the walls of a temple in Peru.
Yeah, that's what they said about the Peruvian temple as well. Yes, it's one of Earth's great mysteries, that no primitive man could possibly have built such a structure. Well, now we've solved it.
You say that your ancestors were travelling in space when other worlds were still primitive?
Then they almost certainly visited Earth and taught the people there how to build.
Yes, they must drain their electrical energy from the atmosphere, probably via that beacon.
Well, you seem to have a crude grasp of the general idea, yes.
Another of our Dalek friends has had root trouble.
Well. Now that must be one of the seven hundred wonders of the universe.
I'm afraid you're not going any closer.
I've got something far more important for you to do.
Sarah, if that Earth rocket doesn't get away from here, millions of people are going to die.
I want you to make Galloway and his friends understand they've got to get the parrinium aboard that ship and be ready for blast off the moment the power is restored. Now remember the Daleks will be fully powered too and they'll do everything they can to destroy the Earth ship.
Yes, I'm certain of it. I know the Daleks and they're not medical missionaries.
Good girl. You'll take care of yourself, won't you?
There's just one more thing. If I don't come back.
You must go with them.
It's beautiful. Beautiful.
Touch sensitised. That's brilliant.
Yes.
Yes, it's difficult, very difficult.
Vaguely, but I
I think I have something here. These symbols don't conform.
Where?
Well, I simply picked out the symbol that appeared to be different and traced its outline on the wall.
Well, I can't think what else.
I should think that is extremely unlikely. He didn't get out again, did he.
No, no. No, that doesn't just make sense.
Yes, that's right. They got this far then they couldn't pass the next intelligence test.
I'm not sure yet. Logically, there must be one.
Ah, yes. Yes, just as I thought. Good. Good. Splendid. In fact, capital!
Oh, no, no. It's much more than that. It's a maze. A test of skill and logic that we have to pass before we can move deeper into the city.
Well then, we shall simply add to these decorations.
Right, let's see what we've got here. Well, there's a point of entry here. The exit down there. Now as this wall is touch sensitised, simply by moving my finger along the correct route, should register success or failure. All right, well, here goes.
Yes I think we've got it. I think this is it, Bellal. Yes, that's it!
Stop. Don't move!
It's another test, I think.
The people who built this city, they didn't go in for ornamental floors, did they?
No, neither do I.
Tell me, have you ever tried Venusian hopscotch? No, it's a silly question. You wouldn't have done. Anyway, now's your chance to learn. I want you to do exactly what I do, all right?
Now jump. Good. Now the next two white triangles. No, no, no. Not the red, the white. To the right. That's it. And the other foot in the other white triangle Good, don't touch the red. Now, stay exactly where you are and give me your hand. Now, when I count three, you jump, and don't touch any of those squares. One, two, three, right, jump!
Well done. That's rather a jolly game, don't you think?
Oh yes, I think so. Let me show you something.
Five piastas. Do I need five piastas? No, I don't think so. Right then, just you watch this.
Tilt. Right, let's go and see what other pleasures they have in store for us.
Don't be too sure.
Yes, its bloodstream rather than its stomach. We're being moved around like
microbes, Bellal. And all the time getting closer to the heart.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. A room without a clue, yet everything within this city has got a function. This room must be here for a purpose.
No. No, we'll have to start all over again. Try in that corner, will you? There's a good chap.
You know, I have a feeling
Bellal, don't! Bellal? Bellal, don't. Now listen to me. Don't fire that gun. Now remember why we're here. Remember why we came to this city.
Bellal, I'm your friend. Your friend. You know that. Don't fire that gun.
Don't fire that gun! Now, what's happened? What is it?
Yes, well, whatever it is, we seem to have qualified for the next test. Do you feel ready to go on?
Yes. Come on, old chap.
We must be getting very close to the centre of the city by now.
I shouldn't be too sure. Have you any idea why the city should be testing us in this way?
Well, they could have destroyed us dozens of times. Instead they gave us a chance to survive by using our intelligence.
Oh, yes. By passing these tests we've proved that we have an intelligence level that could be useful. We might have some knowledge or science that they could add to their databanks.
Well, if I'm right, the ultimate test will be an assault on our sanity, so be ready for it.
Bellal, fight it! Fight it, Bellal!
Fight it! It's an illusion! It's an illusion! You have no substance! No truth! You do not exist! You do not exist!
All right, old chap. It's all over now. It's all right. It's all over. There, that's it. What is it?
Our entrance must have created a current of air which broke the surface tension.
The brain and the nervous system that we've go to destroy.
I think I know a way.
What is it?
What is it?
We haven't got much time.
The city is creating antibodies. They're trying to neutralise us. Now keep a very close eye on them. Let me know the moment they're complete.
Yes, all right, I've nearly finished.
Psychological warfare. I'm trying to destroy the city's brain. Engineer what in human terms is called a nervous breakdown.
The computer is a machine of logic, Bellal, it cannot stand paradoxes.
It should be safe now. Come on!
The controls are beginning to break down. it's working. Come on.
The battle's not over yet. If I know the Daleks, they'll do everything they can to stop that Earth mission ship from getting away. Come on!
They're getting ready to leave.
Yes. I know the Daleks, and they'll cause the maximum havoc and destruction before they go.
It's their scorched planet policy.
Shush! How did it go?
Good.
Well, that's not going to be so easy. Come over here and see for yourself. Come on. Look.
Well, don't prolong the agony. It's obvious you mean to kill us. Why don't you get on with it?
Well, what had you in mind?
I imagine the Daleks have already taken that into account, Peter.
Come on, get out of here quick or we'll be caught in the exhaust blast! Come on, out! Come on, quick. Move!
What do you mean?
Well, he did his duty, now you must do yours. Get that parrinium to where it's needed.
It's rather a pity, in a way. Now the universe is down to six hundred and ninety nine wonders.

Apalapucia.
Apalapucia.
Chia.
Apalapucia.
Beautiful word, beautiful world. Apalapucia, voted number two planet in the top ten greatest destinations for the discerning intergalactic traveller.
It's hideous. Everyone goes to number one. Planet of the coffee shops. Apalapucia. I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. I give you
Doors. Yes. I give you doors. But on the other side of those doors, I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades.
Your phone?
Your mobile telephone? I bring you to a paradise planet, two billion light years from Earth, and you want to update Twitter.
On the counter, by the DVDs.
I don't know. Push a button.
Okay, so rain check on the soaring silver colonnades.
Rory, I think I've found her.
Hands. Hello, hands. Robot with hands, Rory.
Er, Amy? Stay calm. Stay still. Ah, time's gone wobbly. I hate it when it does that.
It's okay, I've got you, you're fine.
A week?
A week? I'm so sorry. Ah-ha. Same room, different times. Two different timestreams running parallel but at different speeds. Amy, you're in a faster timestream.
Amy!
Come on. Gotcha. There. Stabilised, settled, shush.
Organic skin. Ultimate universal interface, grown and grafted, not born. I mean, it's actually seeing with its fingers, scanning the room. But why not just give it eyes?
As long as it takes.
Amy, what exactly did you do?
Okay, so you can't follow her directly. You know, it's never simple. Did you hear that, Handbot? She pressed the wrong button, that's all. We're aliens, we didn't know.
What?
The one day plague.
No, you get it, and you die in a day.
Sterile area. I'm safe.
Chen Seven only affects two-hearted races like Apalapucians.
Yeah, like me. Walk into that facility, I'm dead in a day.
Time moves faster on Amy's side of the glass.
Amy, you said you'd been here a week. What did you eat?
No, because that Red Waterfall time is compressed. That's the point. The Time Glass syncs up the
Two timestreams for visits. You could be in here for a day, and watch them live out their entire lives.
No, Rory, it's kind. You've got a choice. Sit by their
Bedside for twenty four hours and watch them die, or sit in here for twenty four hours and watch them live. Which would you choose?
I'm here, Amy. I'm right here.
Turn left just a fraction. Bit more. Stop. That's it.
Eye to eye to eye.
Amy, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the Tardis. Like satnav, I'll use it to get a lock, then smash through using the Tardis to get you out. Until then, you're on your own.
Locking it on to Amy. Small act of vandalism. No one'll mind.
Ah, that'll be the small act of vandalism alarm. Amy, I need you to go into the facility just for a bit. Find somewhere safe and leave me a sign. Remember, you're immune to Chen Seven, but don't let them give you anything. They don't know you're alien. Their kindness will kill you. Now go.
This is locked onto Amy permanently. Play the signal into the console, the Tardis'll follow it. Now then, I know you're in here.
Er, er, ha ha! How do I look?
Glasses are cool, see?
Oh, yes. Hello, handsome man.
Hello, Rory-cam.
We're breaking into Twostreams. Now, I can't go in there. The Chen Seven'll kill me, no regeneration. You will be my eyes and ears.
That's the spirit. Now, smashing through a timewall could get a bit hairy.
Don't know. Never tried. Best hold onto something.
Good old us.
Focus on the positive.
We locked onto Amy's timestream.
Eyes front, soldier.
Apalapucians are the great cultural scavengers, Rory. This gallery's a scrapbook of their favourite places.
Right, Rory, switch the Time Glass on and sonic it.
I'm sending a command signal to the screwdriver. Amy's here somewhere, if I can just get a lock on her.
I wonder what happens if we mix the filters?
Oh, there they are. Forty thousand time streams overlapping. Red Waterfall isn't one time stream, it's thousands.
Oh, Rory.
Trust you to think of that.
I think they're happy to be alive. Better than the alternative.
Er
I think the timestream lock might be a bit wobbly.
Sorry.
Er, yes. Putting the speaker phone on.
Amy
Amy, behind you.
We locked on to a timestream, Rory. This is it.
Where did you get a sonic screwdriver?
I don't know that I would have.
Is that really all I taught you?
Amy Pond, I am going to put this right. You said you learned from an
Interface. Can I speak with it?
Sorry to interrupt that beautiful moment, but temporal engines
Like that have a regulator valve. Has to be kept at a distance from the main reactor or there'd be feedback. Interface, where's the regulator?
Oh. Very, very ah.
Interface, I need to run through some technical specifications.
Rory, give me to Amy a minute.
There's still time, Amy. There's still time to fix everything.
Okay. So, here's the plan.
Time is always a bit wibbly-wobbly, but in Twostreams it's extra wobbly.
I've worked out how to hijack the Temporal Engines and use them to fold two points of Amy's timeline together. We're bringing her out of the then and into the now. Amy, I just need to borrow your brain a minute. It won't hurt, probably. Almost probably and then
Amy Pond, I'm going to save you.
Amy, you've got to help us help you. I need you to think back
Thirty six years ago. Amy? Amy!
We could take this Amy with us, easy, but if we do, our Amy has to wait thirty six years to be rescued.
Rory
I'm so sorry, but, Rory
That is not how I travel.
Rory, is the Time Glass still on? If the link's still active, I think I can hear Amy. Our Amy.
Yes, except sometimes knowing your own future's what enables you to change it. Especially if you're bloody minded, contradictory
And completely unpredictable.
Yes, if anyone could defeat pre-destiny,
It's your wife.
I don't know.
It's your marriage.
Perhaps. Maybe, if I shunted the reality compensators on the Tardis, re-calibrated the Doomsday bumpers and jettisoned the karaoke bar, yes. Maybe. Yes. It could do it. The Tardis could sustain the paradox.
Okay. Amy, Past Amy, stand by the door. Future Amy, you too.
Future Amy, can I borrow your sonic scr
Probe.
Rory, sonic it. Double our power. Amy Now, you're our link to Amy Then.
We need to get a signal through, and that signal
Will be a thought.
Amy Now and Amy Then, share a thought. Something so
Powerful that it can rip through time. Rory
Sonic the plinth front. Inside you'll find
Three levers and a jumble of wiring.
That's the regulator valve. After we re-route it, you have ten minutes to get back to the Tardis.
Pull out the red and green receptors. Re-route the blue into the red and
The green into blue. Leave the red loose and on no account
Touch anything yellow. Come on, Rory. It's hardly rocket science. It's just
Quantum physics.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, the levers.
Throw them in order.
And Amys, start thinking the most important thought you have ever had.
Hold it in your head and do not let it go. Lever one.
Lever two, Rory. Lever three.
Rory. Rory, take the glasses off. You're getting temporal feedback.
Whoa! Calm down, dear. Rory, Amy, we've created a massive paradox and the Tardis hates it. She's self-phasing, trying to get out of here. What's the nasty Amy done to you. Just calm down, dear. Hang on in there. Rory, you've got eight minutes left. I'm sorry, you're on your own now.
Ah, it's just an anaesthetic. She'll be fine.
I'm sorry.
I lied to her, Rory. There can never be two Amys in the Tardis. The paradox is too massive.
No, she'll never have existed. When we save our Amy, this future won't have happened.
No, she's not real.
Look, we take this Amy, we leave ours. Only one Amy in the Tardis. Which one do you want?
It's your choice.
Your choice, Rory.
I promised you I'd save her, and there she is. Safe.
I'll leave you two alone.

Good morning, class. Are we sitting comfortably?
So, physics. Physics, eh? Physics. Physics. Physics! Physics. Physics, physics, physics, physics, physics, physics, physics. I hope one of you is getting all this down. Okay let's see what you know. Two identical strips of nylon are charged with static electricity and hung from a string so they can swing freely. What would happen if they were brought near each other?
Yes, er, what's your name?
Milo! Off you go.
Correctamundo! A word I have never used before and hopefully never will again. Question two. I coil up a thin piece of microwire and place it in a glass of water. Then I turn on the electricity and measure to see if the water's temperature is affected. My question is this. How do I measure the electrical power going into the coil?
Someone else. No? Okay, Milo, go for it.
Two to Milo. Right then, Milo, tell me this. True or false. The greater the dampening of the system, the quicker it loses energy to its surroundings.
What is non-coding DNA?
Sixty five thousand nine hundred and eighty three times five?
How do you travel faster than light?
Sorry, could you just? There's a bit of gravy. No, no, just, just there.
Blame your boyfriend. He's the one who put us onto this. And he was right. Boy in class this morning, got a knowledge way beyond planet Earth.
Yeah, they're a bit different.
It's very well behaved, this place.
I thought there'd be happy slapping hoodies. Happy slapping hoodies with ASBOs. Happy slapping hoodies with ASBOs and ringtones. Huh? Huh? Oh, yeah. Don't tell me I don't fit in.
Hello.
I'll have the crumble.
And, it's ever since the new headmaster arrived?
How's that weird?
Hmm. The world is very strange.
Oh, I should think so.
Hm? Er, Smith. John Smith.
Well, it's a very common name.
Nice to meet you. Yes, very nice. More than nice. Brilliant.
No. Er, it's only my second day.
You don't sound like someone just doing a profile.
No. Good for you.
Good for you. Oh, good for you, Sarah Jane Smith.
All right, team. Oh, I hate people who say team. Er, gang. Er, comrades. Anyway, Rose, go to the kitchen. Get a sample of that oil. Mickey, the new staff are all Maths teachers. Go and check out the Maths department. I'm going to look in Finch's office. Be back here in ten minutes.
Hello, Sarah Jane.
Yeah. Half a dozen times since we last met.
So do you.
Well, UFO sighting, school gets record results. I couldn't resist. What about you?
I lived. Everyone else died.
Everyone died, Sarah.
Rose, Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane, Rose.
And you decided to scream.
Like a little girl?
Nine, maybe ten years old. I'm seeing pigtails, frilly skirt.
Anyway, moving on. Everything started when Mister Finch arrived. We should go and check his office.
Oh, I must've done. Sarah Jane. Mention her all the time.
Maybe those rats were food.
Rose, you know you used to think all the teachers slept in the school? Well, they do.
When Finch arrived, he brought with him seven new teachers, four dinner ladies and a nurse. Thirteen. Thirteen big bat people. Come on.
I need the Tardis. I've got to analyse that oil from the kitchen.
K9! Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith, allow me to introduce K9. well, K9 Mark Three to be precise.
Oi! Listen, in the year five thousand, this was cutting edge. What's happened to him?
Well, didn't you try and get him repaired?
Ooh, what's the nasty lady done to you, eh?
Right on top of it, yeah.
She was there too.
I told you. I was called back home and in those days humans weren't allowed.
Oh, you didn't need me. You were getting on with your life.
All those things you saw, do you want me to apologise for that?
Look at you, you're investigating. You found that school. You're doing what we always did.
I couldn't.
Where was it?
Right. That's next to Croydon, isn't it?
Oh, hey. Now we're in business.
He recognises me.
Rose, give us the oil.
I'm no dinner lady. And I don't often say that.
Here we go. Come on, boy. Here we go.
They're Krillitanes.
Very. Think of how bad things could possibly be, and add another suitcase full of bad.
They're a composite race. Just like your culture is a mixture of traditions from all sorts of countries, people you've invaded or have been invaded by. You've got bits of Viking, bits of France, bits of whatever. The Krillitanes are the same. An amalgam of the races they've conquered. But they take physical aspects as well. They cherry pick the best bits from the people they destroy. That's why I didn't recognise them. The last time I saw Krillitanes, they looked just like us except they had really long necks.
It's the children. They're doing something to the children.
Does it matter?
As opposed to what?
No. Not to you.
I don't age. I regenerate. But humans decay. You wither and you die. Imagine watching that happen to someone who you
You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.
Rose and Sarah, you go to the Maths room. Crack open those computers, I need to see the hardware inside. Here, you might need this.
Mickey, surveillance. I want you outside.
Don't forget to leave the window open a crack.
I didn't mean for him.
It's time I had a word with Mister Finch.
Who are you?
The Doctor. Since when did Krillitanes have wings?
And now you're shaped human.
And the others?
This plan of yours. What is it?
That's why I'm asking.
If I don't like it, then it will stop.
I'm so old now. I used to have so much mercy. You get one warning. That was it.
How's it going?
What? Listen, I need to find out what's programmed inside these.
What? Stop it!
I can't shift it.
Anything except a deadlock seal. There's got to be something inside here. What're they teaching those kids?
Some sort of code.
No. No, that can't be.
The Skasis Paradigm. They're trying to crack the Skasis Paradigm.
The God maker. The universal theory. Crack that equation and you've got control of the building blocks of the universe. Time and space and matter, yours to control.
Yes. And their learning power is being accelerated by the oil. That oil from the kitchens, it works as a, as a conducting agent. Makes the kids cleverer.
What's fifty nine times thirty five?
No, it's got to be children. The God maker needs imagination to crack it. They're not just using the children's brains to break the code, they're using their souls.
Oh yeah? The whole of creation with the face of Mister Finch? Call me old fashioned, but I like things as they are.
What, by someone like you?
I could save everyone.
I could stop the war.
Out!
Yeah. Sorry.
Come on!
K9, hold them back!
It's the oil. Krillitane life forms can't handle the oil. That's it! They've changed their physiology so often, even their own oil is toxic to them. How much was there in the kitchens?
Okay, we need to get to the kitchens. Mickey.
Get all the children unplugged and out of the school. Now then, bats, bats, bats. How do we fight bats?
Come on, boy. Good boy.
They've been deadlock sealed. Finch must've done that. I can't open them.
Right. Everyone out the back door. K9, stay with me.
But you'll be trapped inside.
I can't let you do that.
Goodbye, old friend.
You good dog.
We need to run.
I'm sorry.
Cup of tea?
Do you like it?
Er, we're about to head off, but you could come with us.
Okay then, I could do with a laugh.
Something to tell the grandkids.
Right. Yes, sorry. I didn't get a chance to ask. You haven't? There hasn't been anyone? You know.
Oh, it's not goodbye.
Goodbye, my Sarah Jane.

Yes, yes.
Good afternoon!
What is all this? Who is he? How did he attack you? Why did he attack you?
Come on. Give me a hand.
Come away, child. Dear me. Out of one trouble into another!
It's all right, old chap, I have my friend here to thank for my life. Are you all right, dear boy?
That Saracen very nearly did for me. Of course. Did you hear what that man called him? Saracen. Malek Ric! Yes, that was the name the Saracens had for King Richard, Coeur de Lion. Malek Ric.
Yes, he's got a very bad wound here.
This belt. Wait a minute. Of course, yes. I remember. This belongs to his royal master, King Richard. He'll certainly be glad to get this back again. We should be able to get into his favour. We shall need some assistance to help find Barbara.
Be careful, my boy.
How is he, my dear? Did he take the drug I gave you?
Yes. Well, he should be better when we get him back to his own people.
Are you all right?
Well, as I said before, we must try and get some help from King Richard. This certainly belongs to him.
Well, at the moment we can do nothing further until I find some clothes for all of us to wear, hmm? Yes. Now I think Vicki and I should go down into that city and see what we can find. Now, here, child. Put on this cloak, and it'll help to act as a disguise.
It's a good idea, but be careful. In the meantime, keep your eye on that.
Come along, child.
No.
I know of the place well.
I am not a Venetian, neither am I a trader.
You have some very fine materials here.
Yes, that's what they all say.
Truly remarkable, all the colours of the rainbow. Ha, ha! Yes, it's truly Where did you say these wonderful materials came from?
Basra? Ah, most interesting.
(sotto) Having been stolen once, they can be stolen again, or perhaps borrowed, shall we say, hmm?
Oh, my poor friend, what a misfortune. You've had an accident.
Oh, yes, you are, but I'm afraid I must leave you with your misfortune. But I shall return. Yes, I will return and you shall not be the loser by this business.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, for being here. For being here when you were most needed. Yes, yes. Goodbye.
Goodbye. And long live the Sultan.
One small thing remains yours, sire.
I'm not sure this is the time.
Gently, my boy, gently.
It would be of little use, a player king and a young woman, sire.
Our young friend is a woman, sire. Have pity. Let us help her.
I think I know what he means, sire. Here Saladin, mighty ruler and commander of huge armies, believes he's captured you.
You could spread this tale by word of mouth and all the world would know that Saladin fears you.
Your messenger might offer to exchange a hundred prisoners for the knight he holds.
He might think you undervalue his men. One hundred men to one of yours. Methinks a fair bargain, sire.
We are your servants, sire.
His voice has not yet broken, your Highness.
Your Highness. Come, Victor. Let us tend upon the others.
I certainly didn't like the way the Chamberlain examined Vicki's clothes. And come to think of it, they were originally stolen from here.
You do, do you? Then I suggest we get along with it.
How should I know, dear fellow? If the King wants you to, surely that's good enough.
Never mind the mights, my dear, just concentrate on what you're doing. Here we are. Now I think just the sword and you're ready.
Oh, the King will tell you that. Do you know, my boy, I have an idea that King Richard still wants to send you to see Saladin after all.
Your royal commands have been carried out, your Majesty.
You are very gracious, sire.
It is a king's prerogative to make yesterday's deafness today's keen hearing.
Kneel, my boy. Kneel, kneel. Come along, come along.
I hope you will find Barbara safe and well, dear boy, er, Sir Ian.
Godspeed. And remember, be valiant.
I almost wish I'd been knighted too.
Oh? Pray, what about?
What's this?
Who is this? Do you know?
Really?
And a pretty poor garment, too.
Yes, now there really is a point there, isn't there? If I stole from you, my lord Chamberlain, how could I steal from him?
Then how could I steal from him, eh, you blockhead?
Oh, how nice for you.
Then whoever it was stole them from you must have sold them to you. Now, don't you agree?
He must have stolen them from you.
Now, just a minute! Oh, my dear Chamberlain, so undignified. The merchant bought the clothes in good faith and paid for them in good money. Now please return his money.
Now, now, now. You mustn't let an honest man suffer. Pay him!
Yes, off you go! Off you go! Well, we seem to have got out of that problem all right, hmm?
All right, all right, don't get so carried away my friend. It's a fine cloak. You've done a very good job.
Now the next question is, what could you do for my boy, hmm? I want something of finer quality.
Quite so, quite so, thank you, thank you. Now run away and have a good think about it, and let me know in the morning what you've decided.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you known how we're placed here. It's, it's a, hmm?
Oh, forgive me, your highness. This is my young ward. Having found ourselves in a hostile country I decided to use this disguise.
We are indeed grateful, your Highness.
Can I help you, madam?
May I ask, why, of all people here, you've come to me, hmm?
If there is a plan, my lady, I will find out what it is and keep close in touch, hmm?
The household purse, hmm?
Well, my dear, in one way I don't think things have turned out too badly after all, hmm?
You will be much safer under Joanna's wing.
Of course, my child.
Only temporarily.
What a question.
Ah, now, now, now. What is all this, eh, hmm?
Ah, surely you know me better than that, child? No, my reservation was that I might get entangled in court intrigue and that's going to be very, very dangerous. Very dangerous indeed.
I am indeed glad. sir, to know that you are thinking in terms of peace.
It is a good scheme, sire, if the princess agrees.
Will she agree?
Pretence, sir? Here's an opportunity to save the lives of many men and you do naught but turn it down without any kind of thought. What do you think you are doing?
With swords, I suppose?
You stupid butcher! Can you think of nothing else but killing, hmm?
I admire bravery and loyalty, sir. You have both of these. But, unfortunately you haven't any brain at all. I hate fools.
We are both very grateful to you, your Highness.
I am afraid not, your Highness.
He said he wished to speak to you himself.
You have, your Highness, but the King spoke to me in confidence. I must not steal his thunder, hmm?
I thought something like this would happen, child.
That she's going to get married? Of course not.
I have no desire to upset the King. Dear, dear, dear, all this intrigue. I knew it. All this trouble. Here comes the King.
Your Majesty, if you believe that I
What is the meaning of this?
You call yourself a nobleman, sir, yet it appears you enjoy bullying young girls, hmm? We are not the guilty ones here, and don't look away when I'm talking to you. You, sir!
Your Majesty. I didn't realise you were there, sire.
May I ask you something, sire? If you knew it was the Earl of Leicester that gave your marriage plans away to your sister, why didn't you accuse him, have it out with him then and there?
But I have made an enemy of him, sire.
I think I agree, sire.
We shall leave at once, sire.
There is something important, sire. If you are able to defeat Saladin in this battle, can you hold the city?
You will, sire.
I am certain, sire. And when you look upon the city itself, you will be able to find the answer to the problem of this war. May we now take our leave, sire?
As fast as our legs can carry us, my dear.
Only from afar. He won't be able to capture it. Even now his armies are marching on a campaign that he can never win.
I'm afraid not, my dear. No, history must take its course.
They're between us and the ship.
Yes, they are. I wonder what they're up to?
No, there's too many of them. Perhaps we can try? No, we can't do that.
Now I know why we've been followed.
It's that meddling fool, Leicester. We've got to try and slip through them. Remember, not a sound. Not a sound. In you go.
Take your hands off me, sir! What are you doing? Unhand me! How dare you!
What is the meaning of this, sir? The King gave me leave to go.
Gentlemen, since I am to depart so punctiliously, I would ask you to grant me one last wish.
Thank you. I would like to look once more upon the city of Jaffa. Then you may do what you will with me.
Thank you, my lord.
What about that performance?
Well, my dear boy, I must say I think you've earned a good knight's sleep.
Now, I suppose, the Tardis will materialise when it's ready.
Oh, my dear young woman, why don't you go have a cup of tea or something.
I don't know.

It's maddening, you know. So nearly there. If I could only cut out their override on the dematerialisation circuit. Let me see those figures.
What gave you that idea?
My dear Jo, the Tardis was being operated then under remote control by the High Council of the Time Lords.
I don't want it to work for them. I want it to work for me. No one's going to turn me into an interplanetary puppet. Yes, of course. Why didn't I think of that before?
Yes, of course, I remember now. Look, don't worry, my dear. I know you're alarmed but you needn't be.
Yes, well I think that should do it. Why on Earth I never realised that.
Oh, no. What are you doing here?
Well, I'm not here. Don't worry. Well, that is, in a sense I am here, but you are not there. Yes, well, it's a bit difficult to explain really.
This won't do at all. We can't have two of us running about.
Yes, well don't worry. It will all sort itself
Well, it's a very complicated thing, time, Jo. Once you've begun tampering with it, the oddest things start happening.
Back into their own time stream, of course. Or do I mean forward?
Look, Jo, don't worry about it. It was a freak affect. It's very unlikely to happen again. Hold that and give me those papers.
Sorry, Brigadier. I'm busy.
No, can't say that I have.
My dear chap, I'm a scientist, not a politician.
Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier.
All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem?
Any idea who?
And you're absolutely certain that he used the word ghost?
Did you also make those marks on the floor over there? Muddy feet, Sir Reginald. Someone was in here, you know.
Oh, he's in a bad way, poor chap. You'd better get him to the hospital.
I'm not sure.
Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely injured man down by the canal tunnel.
And carrying that gun.
I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory and run a few tests on it.
No, not for the moment. I think we'll just have to sit and wait and hope that our would-be assassin regains consciousness.
Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator.
That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun. Only it's far more sophisticated than any weapon yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at this.
Quite an effective little weapon, eh?
Well, that was my theory at first, yes, but the metallurgical analysis shows that the iron constituent is very much of this world. In fact, it was mined not very far from here. North Wales.
Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier?
I am.
Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting the unimaginative nature of the military mind. But we saw a couple of amicas seperatas a few moments ago, didn't we, Jo?
Yes, here in this laboratory.
Mind you, they were manifestations of a much more benevolent kind. None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers, but ghosts, none the less.
Well, I can't get this thing to work, either. But this is a form of time machine, of a very crude kind.
Come over here. Look at this. Now what do you think that is?
Top of the class, Jo. Now then, pop this in here, like that.
Now, as far as I can gather, when you push this button, it should
Good grief! It's working!
All right, Jo, all right.
Well, the thing's completely dead now.
Yes, it started to work. Oh, I see, yes. Yes, the temporal feedback circuit has overloaded.
In your terms, Brigadier, the thing's blown a fuse.
Please.
Well?
Well, everything that happens seems to centre round Styles' house.
And whoever tried to harm him will probably try again. Jo, how would you like to spend the night in a haunted house?
You know, one thing you can be certain of with politicians, is that whatever their political ideas, they always keep a well-stocked larder. Not to mention the cellar.
Well, you heard what Miss Paget said, Jo. We were to treat the place as our own.
That's common sense. You can't expect a ghost to walk in a house full of people, can you? Come on, tuck in.
Well, you ought to eat something, you know. This is likely to be a very long night.
It's a clock chiming. I say, you really ought to try this gorgonzola cheese. It's absolutely delicious.
Yes. Yes, that's a most good humoured wine. A touch sardonic perhaps, but not cynical. Yes, a most civilised wine. One after my own heart.
Jo?
And what was all that about?
Oh, quite right. Do you know, I remember saying to old Napoleon. Boney, I said, always remember an army marches on its stomach.
Mmm?
Well, there are many different kinds of ghosts, Jo. Ghosts from the past and ghosts from the future.
What's more to the point is, have they got us in mind?
It's just the wind.
Look, why don't you take a nap?
Wake up, Jo. It's all right. It's morning.
No, nothing at all.
Jo! Jo!
My dear young lady, I'm afraid I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Execution?
May I ask whose orders?
No, only that you're making one fundamental mistake.
A question of mistaken identity. I am not Sir Reginald Styles.
Sir Reginald is at this moment many thousands of miles away. In Peking, to be precise.
No, I'm not. He flew there yesterday.
It's all there in the paper in front of you. Why don't you take a look?
I'm sorry to disappoint you. By the way, that machine of yours is a bit antiquated, isn't it? Do you mind if I suggest some improvements and
Well, believe it or believe it not, I came here to see you.
Because you've already tried to kill Styles once and failed. It was logical that you would try again.
That's right. I wanted to talk to you.
To find out where you came from. And more to the point when.
That's better.
You know, I've got a good mind to let you stay like that. So much more peaceful. In any case, even if I released you, you'd probably ask me a lot of fool questions.
On the face of it, three rather desperate people.
You're prejudiced.
Yes, that's not in their favour, I'll admit. You know, we shouldn't really judge them until we find out why they're here. Well, come on, Jo. What about trying out some of that escapology of yours?
I'll tell you what. Have a try at untying mine.
Got them?
Well, technologically speaking, that gun of theirs is about two hundred years ahead of its time. Your time, that is. The twenty second century visiting the twentieth. A planned expedition through time to meet and kill an important politician. Now, why?
He's obviously not only important to us, he's also important to them. Or history, their history, must talk a lot about Sir Reginald Styles, I think.
That's it, yes. How are you doing?
Well, in that case, there's only one thing left for us to do.
You're learning, Jo.
Have you got a better theory?
Fanatics, Jo, not thugs. Changing history is a very fanatical idea, you know.
Jo, every choice we make changes the history of the world.
Ah, that's the Blinovitch limitation effect.
Hello? Hello?
Yes.
Ah.
Yes, fine, Brigadier. Yes, things couldn't be better.
Did they? Oh yes, we were probably down the cellar at the time. Old Styles keeps a remarkably good selection of wines, you know.
Look, I don't that's very wise, Brigadier.
Yes, well, you tell Captain Yates not to worry. Everything's fine. And tell old Styles too, and the Prime Minister.
Oh, and Brigadier?
Don't forget to tell it to the Marines. Goodbye.
Well, that surprises you? I should have thought with your insight into the future. Oh no, in your case, it'd be the past, wouldn't it.
Jo, put that thing down. I've only just got it in working order.
Jo, do as she says.
Jo? Jo! Look, can't you do anything?
What's happened to her?
And if she wasn't?
How do you do? Hai!
Thank you, Brigadier, for that timely intervention.
Yes, well, I'll explain about him later. Excuse me, old chap, I'm in a hurry.
Please, wait. I've got to talk to you.
Yes. Yes, so you did.
Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar with the concept of time travel than you are. Now wait a minute. Before the time transference, I saw a Dalek.
Indeed I do. I know them only too well. They've been my bitterest enemy for many years.
Look, I came here in order to find Miss Jo Grant.
But as long as there's a chance.
Wait a minute. What is my best way of finding her?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Am I? Who am I spying for?
That wasn't a question, that was a statement.
Poor fellows. I'm sorry I can't oblige them at the moment. I'm not in the mood for games.
I've already told you what I'm doing here. I'm looking for a girl called Jo Grant!
Don't be stupid, man!
What?
Look, nobody sent me. I'm not a spy or a guerilla. I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Then I'm glad you finally succeeded.
You surprise me.
Frankly, I don't know whether I can stand much more of your hospitality.
Miss Grant?
Is she safe?
No, thank you, no, not for me. Though I must admit, it's an excellent vintage. Well, it's the finest I've tasted since, er, well, since we had dinner at old Styles' house. Do you remember, Jo?
It was. Two hundred years to be precise. And quite frankly, I wish I was back there now.
Oh, I've known many times, and some of them much more pleasant than others.
Well, I met some people today who were far from kind.
Well, better than jumping from the crack of a whip from some security guard. Do you run all your factories like that, Controller?
Oh? Then what was it?
Including old men and women, even children?
Now that's an old fashioned point of view, even from my standards.
Then why do you need so many people to keep them under control? Don't they like being happy and prosperous?
Am I now?
Does he? I wonder why?
When I meet a regime that needs to import savage alien life forms as security guards, I begin to wonder who the real criminals are.
You mean there aren't enough humans around that will follow your orders so blindly?
Isn't it? Then what you're saying is that the entire human population of this planet, apart from a few remarkable exceptions like yourself, are really only fit to lead the life of a dog. Why?
Haven't I? Who really rules this planet of yours?
Neither do you, Jo. Neither do you. That man is no more than a superior slave himself. Humans don't rule this world any longer, Jo.
The most evil, ruthless life form in the cosmos. The Daleks.
Right. Now, do you understand exactly what to do?
Good.
Right. Now.
Pity. That was rather a good vintage.
It doesn't matter. Come on.
You won't succeed, you know.
My dear man, how can I tell you what I don't know myself?
Yes, for your own purposes.
I don't doubt it.
On that contrary, I value it enormously. The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.
As you cooperate with them? Do you really think that makes any difference?
Reasonable? They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.
You sir, you sir, are a traitor! You're a Quisling!
So, they've turned the Earth into a giant factory, with all the wealth and minerals were looted and taken to Skaro.
A family of Quisling's, eh?
Wouldn't you have helped more by organising the fight against them?
That's not what your criminal guerillas seem to think, is it.
For the last time, I tell you I haven't got any information. And quite frankly, even if I had, I wouldn't give it to you!
Yes, thank you. All the better for seeing you.
Put that gun down. There's no point in murdering him.
Nevertheless, he's not your real enemy.
They would always have found someone. Now just leave him.
This history of yours, it talks about Sir Reginald Styles?
So the conference he called was just a trick?
So, you went back into our time to kill Styles before he could carry out his plan.
Well, that must have been the man that we saw down by the canal tunnel. You remember, Jo, the one who vanished from the ambulance?
Yes, well, there's one thing I don't quite understand and that is why were you so keen to rescue us? Well believe me, we're grateful, but
Yes.
What do you expect me to do?
You're asking me to commit murder!
That is still murder.
Yes, but would it?
But your history could be wrong, you know? Now listen, why don't you send us back to our time? We know the future now. Maybe there are other things we can do?
Yes, I agree, Jo. Vain to the point of arrogance, a trifle obstinate, perhaps, but basically a good man. So, if it happened, how did it happen? Any of your people still in our time zone?
I'm curious, that's all.
Look, please believe me, I'm completely with you about the ends. I only disagree as to the means.
This mission of yours to the twentieth century. What did you take with you?
Any sabotage equipment?
Dalekanium?
Could it destroy a house?
Well, don't you see? This has happened before.
You went back to change history, but you didn't change anything. You became a part of it.
If Styles didn't cause that explosion, somebody else did.
Isn't that exactly what he would have done? One last suicidal attempt to carry out his orders?
You're trapped in a temporal paradox! Styles didn't cause that explosion and start the wars. You did it yourselves.
It seems simple enough. Bit too simple for my liking.
Good.
Is it madness to want to see a world free from their rule?
Oh yes, it can. And I can do it. Are you going to stop me?
You spoke of the war, of its years of suffering and starvation. Well, I can prevent all that happening, you know.
Thank you. Jo, come here and stand by me.
Brigadier! Brigadier, get everybody out of this house at once.
Never mind all that, just clear this house immediately.
Look, try and use your intelligence, man, even if you are a politician.
Brigadier, get this man and all the delegates out of this area immediately. Use force if you have to! Jo, you stay here.
Shura!
Shura, listen to me. Styles and all the delegates are already leaving this house. You detonate that bomb and you'll be sacrificing yourself for nothing.
No, she's not. They've come back to make sure that their version of history isn't changed. Is everybody out of the house?
Couldn't we set a time fuse?
Very well.
Tell your men to fall back. Let the Daleks into the house.
It may not make military sense but it's the only way.
Your conference has been saved, Sir Reginald. Now it's up to you and your friends to make sure it's a success. You still have a choice.
So do we. We've seen it happen, haven't we, Jo?

What's going on? Don't you realise how dangerous it is to intercept a transmat beam?
Look, whatever I've done for you in the past, I've more than made up for. I will not tolerate this continual interference in my life.
Except mine.
I won't do it. Whatever it is, I refuse.
Daleks? Tell me more.
That's possible. Tell on.
Do you mean avert their creation?
Hmm. That's feasible.
All right, just one more time.
Yes. If you'll let me have the space time coordinates, I'll set the Tardis for Skaro.
Huh?
What?
What's this?
What's that?
Just a moment.
Don't just disappear! What about Sarah and Harry?
Ah, there you are, Sarah.
No, there's been a slight change of plan.
This is Skaro.
Heavy artillery.
It's a creeping barrage. Get down!
Something's annoyed them.
All right.
That's strange. There's centuries between these two weapons.
It's like finding the remains of a stone age man with a transistor radio.
A thousand year war? Civilisation on the point of collapse.
Nothing. Just theorising, that's all.
Come along.
Er, forward.
Halt! Don't move.
I see a land mine. We're in the middle of a mine field. Follow me and tread in my footsteps.
I thought I saw something move. I have a feeling we're being watched.
Let's hope its imagination.
Harry, I'm standing on a land mine. I felt it shift.
If I move my foot, it might detonate it.
I won't.
You back up too, Harry. No point in risking both our lives.
Please, Harry, don't be difficult.
Thank you, Harry.
Let's go.
Hey, look. What do you think?
Protective dome.
Yes.
Even the dead have a part to play. Propped up to make the trenches appear fully manned.
Yes, we may have crossed the lines.
Yes. That's why I think this war's been going on for a very long time. They probably started out with the most modern equipment but no longer have the resources. They have to make do.
Well, it would explain the mixture of equipment.
Let's see where the trench leads.
It's a gas shell!
Poison gas!
Get back!
DOCTOR Yes, you look the type.
Certainly.
It might take some time.
Yes, I've heard that before.
I was just wondering how you propose to wipe the Thals from the face of Skaro with boy soldiers, no ammunition, and very young generals.
I do beg your pardon.
That's very impressive. You mean you're going to sweep these wastelands absolutely?
Harry. Did I hurt your fingers?
Yes, so you said.
So you're Kaleds, eh?
K A L E D S. Why, that's an anagram of. How interesting. Are you fit, Harry?
Good. Now, Alexander the Great, you're going to lead us out of here.
You won't get any medals for being stupid, General. In fact, you won't be getting any more medals for anything.
Back to the wastelands.
Come on.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Perhaps you should introduce us, General.
Yes, but we're not staying long. Don't let us detain you.
This way, Harry!
Yes.
After you.
Keep running.
Keep running!
Down, Harry!
Are you all right?
I wouldn't say that, Harry.
Yes.
Well, it's an etheric beam locator. It's also useful for detecting ion charged emissions.
Well, naturally not. My friend and I are not from your planet.
We are not lying.
Then he must be exceptional. Even I am occasionally wrong about some things. Who is this Davros?
Tell me, what exactly are mutos?
In other words, genetically wounded.
That's a very harsh policy.
Good. Well, now he's gone, any chance of a cup of tea?
Or coffee. My friend and I have had a very trying experience. Haven't we had a trying experience, Harry?
What, no tea?
No tea, Harry.
You can't have that. That bracelet could have no possible use as a weapon.
The Time Ring is our only hope of getting back to the Tardis.
Recovering it has got to be our number one priority. Do you understand, Harry? It's vital.
Thank you. You're not with the military, I assume?
Oh, good, good. Then perhaps we can talk without interruption from rifle butts.
Oh, here and there.
If you didn't know better.
It is also an established scientific fact that there are more than seven galaxies.
Yes.
You were saying?
You can't always judge from external appearances.
It's a long story.
Do you have any inkling of the theory of space dimension correlated to relative time?
Your chief scientist.
Well, I shall be delighted to meet him.
(sotto) A Dalek.
(sotto) A Dalek. Very primitive but undeniably a Dalek.
(sotto) If you say so.
Thank you. I am obliged to you.
Looks like I might be.
They took down reams of notes, every bit of scientific gobbledygook I could think of. Technical jargon that even I didn't understand.
Yes. And I learnt a great deal more from them than they did from me.
Yes.
Yes, and bomb proof. Impregnable from attack from the outside and about three or four miles from the Kaled dome.
Years ago the Kaled government decided to form an Elite group. The best scientific brains in every field.
Yes. But over the years the Elite has become more and more powerful, and now they can demand whatever they like.
But you did save me from becoming the very first victim of a Dalek, thank you.
Well, I have an advantage in terms of time. You see, we've come here at this time because of future concern about the development of the Dalek. I think you're concerned too, aren't you?
(sotto) I think he's going to bite.
Then let us help you.
The mutos.
You've got troubles.
Go on, Ronson.
Now he's trying to change that into a weapon.
Then go to them, Ronson, go to them.
Then help us to escape. Give us the names of the men who have the power.
And I have an uneasy feeling you're going to tell me they're in that cave.
Don't worry, don't worry. We won't let it fall into the wrong hands.
Here's where it comes out into the cave.
Shush. What was that?
It's lighter this way.
Look.
Easy, easy.
One of Davros' experiments?
What?
Never mind the Latin, let's have a look at your foot. Nothing seems to be broken. It's incredible. You have some bruises though, Harry.
You'll be all right. Can you stand up?
Let's get out of here.
We'll find her. We've got to contact the Kaled leaders first.
Yes, of course, and some of what I will tell you relates to events in the future. Not only on this planet but also on others whose existence you don't even know of. But my knowledge is scientific fact. Now, Davros has created a machine creature, a monster which will terrorise and destroy millions and millions of lives and lands throughout all eternity. He has given this machine a name, a Dalek. It is a word new to you, but for a thousand generations it is a name that will bring fear and terror. Now undoubtedly Davros has one of the finest scientific minds in existence, but he has a fanatical desire to perpetuate himself in his machine. He works without conscience, without soul, without pity, and his machines are equally devoid of these qualities.
Yes, it was meant to be.
Yes, let's hope so, Harry. Sometimes words aren't enough.
But that could take months! Davros already has several prototype Daleks ready for action.
It is less than I'd hoped for.
Thank you.
In the Thal dome, you say?
Yes, yes, well never mind about that. Could you help us to find Sarah?
Oh, good, good.
Thank you.
Yes, and that's when our troubles really begin.
Shush.
Yes, and we haven't found Sarah yet. Come on.
Excuse me, can you help me? I'm a spy.
Their suits, Harry.
You all right, Sarah?
Yes, yes, I know. Listen. I want you and Harry to go back to the Kaled dome. Harry knows the way. Tell them all we know. There's a chance if they launch and all-out offensive I might be able to stop the rocket.
Try to sabotage it, or at least delay it. Off you go.
Good luck.
Well, don't just stand there. Come on, you're free! Go now while you've got the chance. Come on!
No, you mustn't.
I sent Harry and Sarah in there.
Yes. Two people very dear to me. I sent them into that holocaust.
Start again. Try and find a way to complete what I set out to do and stop the development of the Daleks.
Yes. Machine creatures that Davros is developing. Monsters.
Let me tell you something. The Kaled government was on the point of stopping Davros' experiments, and rather than let that happen, he helped you to destroy his own race.
Yes, for how long, I wonder.
Thank you.
Keep back. Get out of sight.
We've got to get out of the Thal dome.
Out into the wastelands. Do you know a way?
Good. Yes, they are the Daleks. Come on, lead the way.
Perhaps they did. But Daleks accept no terms. They're programmed to wipe the Thals from the face of this planet.
A few, perhaps, but they need to be grouped into some kind of fighting force to strike the bunker.
Well, destroy Davros and you destroy the Daleks.
It's your only chance. Will you do it?
Good girl. I'm going to try and get back into the bunker now.
Good luck.
Harry!
Sarah! I can hardly believe it.
I thought you were in the Kaled dome when it was hit.
You were absolutely right, Harry. It's vital we go back into the bunker.
The bracelet that the Time Lord gave me is our lifeline. Without it we can never escape from this planet.
Sevrin, would you do something for us, something important?
Over in the Kaled trenches there's a Thal, a girl named Bettan. She's trying to form a resistance group. Join her with as many of your own people as you can get. Their idea is to knock out the bunker.
It'll keep the Elite's troops occupied while I try to find a weakness of the Daleks.
Oh, just one of Davros' experiments. We'd better stick close together.
Not much further. The entrance to the ventilation duct must be just through here.
Look out, Harry!
Jump!
They're not very fast.
Come on, we're there.
Really?
That is nasty. Better not tell Harry, he's gone first.
You were right, Sarah, about there being something nasty waiting for us.
I imagine it had never been programmed for such a concept.
To stop the development of the Daleks.
Because having lived in what you would call the future, I have seen the carnage and destruction they have caused.
Yes, as weapons of hate and machines of war.
But there's still time to change all that. Why not make them a force for good throughout the universe?
Then do it. Be remembered for that.
Many times. I've fought against them.
Not always. They have been defeated, but never utterly defeated. The Dalek menace always remains.
Misfortune, lack of information, sometimes overwhelming opposition.
No, Davros, that is a question that the future must keep secret.
No.
No, I will not!
And if I do lie?
Davros, if I tell you what you want to know, I betray millions of people in the future. I can't do that.
All right, all right! Just leave them alone.
The Dalek invasion of the Earth in the year 2000 was foiled because of an attempt by the Daleks to mine the core of the planet. The magnetic properties of the Earth were... Mars... the Daleks were defeated by a virus that attacked the insulation on the cables in their electrical systems. ...In the space year seventeen thousand was halted by the intervention of a fleet of war rockets from the planet Hyperon. The rockets were made of a metal that was completely resistant to Dalek firepower. The Dalek Task Force was completely destroyed.
I have betrayed the future. Davros, for the last time, consider what you're doing. Stop the development of the Daleks.
It's not the machines, it's the minds of the creatures inside them. Minds that you created. They are totally evil.
Davros, if you had created a virus in your laboratory, something contagious and infectious that killed on contact, a virus that would destroy all other forms of life, would you allow its use?
Would you do it?
But would you do it?
No, Davros.
Why not?
Order the destruction of the incubator section.
I mean it, Davros. Next time I press that switch, it stays pressed. Now give the order!
I'll take that chance. Now give the order.
Tell them the order cannot be countermanded.
No, wait, wait. Davros knows what you're planning. I heard him talking to Nyder.
No, it's not that. I don't know what he's got prepared for you, but believe me, he's ready.
Just be careful. Be careful.
No, there isn't. We've got to recover that Time Ring.
It's on the desk in the main laboratory. And then there's that tape recording that Nyder took. We've got to get it back at all costs. It would make the Daleks invincible. Come on.
Shush.
Useful. Ah. This is something rather more useful.
Yes. Explosives and detonators. It seems almost providential.
The Time Lord gave me three options. There's only one still open. Genocide.
Yes. I'm going to kill everything in the incubation room. I'm going to destroy the Daleks forever.
The flesh and blood part of them. Indeed they are flesh and blood.
Press the button.
Pay it out quickly, Harry.
They're harmless enough, I think. Just unpleasant.
There's no need, Harry. It just remains to put the charges where they'll do the most damage. It shouldn't take me more than a couple of minutes.
Sarah!
Just touch these two strands together and the Daleks are finished. Have I that right?
Well, I do. You see, some things could be better with the Daleks. Many future worlds will become allies just because of their fear of the Daleks.
But the final responsibility is mine, and mine alone. Listen, if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil, to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives, could you then kill that child?
Do I have the right? Simply touch one wire against the other and that's it. The Daleks cease to exist. Hundreds of millions of people, thousands of generations can live without fear, in peace, and never even know the word Dalek.
But I kill, wipe out a whole intelligent lifeform, then I become like them. I'd be no better than the Daleks.
He's going to put a case?
I'm grateful to you, Gharman. More grateful than I can tell you.
Yes.
(sotto) What?
(sotto) We've got to find that Time Ring.
(sotto) Good girl, Sarah. Now all we need is the tape recording, so keep an eye on Nyder.
Now I wonder where Nyder's going at such a crucial moment.
So do I. Let's go.
Now where are you going in such a hurry?
Oh. Somehow that just doesn't ring true.
Now that's a good question. Do you have a good answer? Evidently not. Well then, let's try something else. That tape recording you took, where is it?
Shall we go and see?
Now, be reasonable and open it for us.
Oh, no, no. On the contrary. Now, Davros can't rise from his chair, correct?
And he has the use of only one hand, this hand. (the right one) And Davros never goes anywhere without you, Nyder. So you must open the safe for him. Open it for us.
Thank you. Now let's destroy it.
How very apt. A Dalek gun.
There.
He's not important.
We've got the Time Ring, we've destroyed the tape and Davros' power is broken.
Oh, I think we can leave Gharman to destroy them.
Yes, all we've got to do is touch the Time Ring.
Ah. I must have dropped it in the struggle in the corridor.
Even the sonic screwdriver won't open this door.
Huh?
Who knows. It's out of character for Davros to submit quite so easily.
Give me a moment to find the Time Ring.
Ah! Good. Let's go. Back, back!
Back!
Sarah, take this.
Sevrin, lead them to the main entrance. Get them out of here.
I'm going back to the incubator room. This time I'm going to blow it up.
No! Get out of here. Hurry. Now, go on.
Yes, with a little help from a Dalek. But I'm afraid I've only delayed them for a short time. Perhaps a thousand years.
In the total time scale, no more than that.
Goodbye, Bettan.
Sevrin.
Goodbye. Thank you.
Hands on the Time Ring.
Failed? No, not really. You see, I know that although the Daleks will create havoc and destruction for millions of years, I know also that out of their evil must come something good.

No, neither can I. Oh, careful.
Left hand down. Left hand down! Getting a bit too close to the 1980s.
Well, someone did.
It's not mine.
Hello?
Martha Jones.
You haven't changed a bit.
How's the family?
What about you?
Now, don't start fighting. Martha, Donna. Donna, Martha. Please don't fight. Can't bear fighting.
What man? Lucky what?
Really? Who to?
Oh, I'd rather you were fighting.
What are you searching for?
And you're qualified now. You're a proper doctor.
Wish I could say the same.
Oh, don't salute.
Yeah, long time ago. Back in the 70's. Or was it the 80's? But it was all a bit more homespun back then.
Yeah, that's enough of the sir.
Tell me, what's going on in that factory?
You mean they died simultaneously.
How did they die?
What have the cars got in common?
What's ATMOS?
Zero? No carbon, none at all?
And you think ATMOS is alien.
You must've checked it, before it went on sale.
Really. who'd you get? Oh, right. Me, yes. Good.
A very good question.
Do you know how many cars there are on planet Earth? Eight hundred million. Imagine that. If you could control them, you'd have eight hundred million weapons.
Ionising nano-membrane carbon dioxide converter. Which means that ATMOS works. Filters the CO2 at a molecular level.
No. Decades ahead of its time. Look, do you mind? Could you stand back a bit?
You're carrying a gun. I don't like people with guns hanging around me, all right?
Well, it's true.
People with guns are usually the enemy in my books. You seem quite at home.
Oh right, so it's my fault.
Suppose not.
Yeah? That's more like Martha Jones.
Well.
Why, where have you been?
Why, what's inside it? Or what's not inside it?
So this, this ATMOS thing. Where'd it come from?
And himself would be?
A hothouse for geniuses. Wouldn't mind going there. I get lonely.
You are not coming with me. I want to talk to this Luke Rattigan, not point a gun at him.
Well then, get me a jeep.
Yeah, but if there is a danger of hostile aliens, I think it's best to keep a super-duper time machine away from the front lines.
Yeah, I don't do orders.
I said no salutes.
Oh, you're getting a bit cheeky, you are.
Oh, just in time. Come on, come on, we're going to the country. Fresh air and geniuses, what more could you ask?
Really?
Oh, if that's what you want. I mean, it's a bit soon. I had so many places I had wanted to take you. The Fifteenth Broken Moon of the Medusa Cascade, the Lightning Skies of Cotter Palluni's World, Diamond Coral Reefs of Kataa Flo Ko. Thank you. Thank you, Donna Noble, it's been brilliant. You've, you've saved my life in so many ways. You're, (penny drops) you're just popping home for a visit, that's what you mean.
And then you're coming back.
Yeah.
I know, I know.
Bye!
Ross, one question. If UNIT think that ATMOS is dodgy
Oh, nice one.
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
Is it PE? I wouldn't mind a kick around, I've got me daps on.
Hello.
Ah, but I haven't got a commanding officer. Have you? Oh, this is Ross. Say hello, Ross.
Let's have a look, then. I can smell genius! In a good way.
Oh, now, that's clever. Look. Single molecule fabric, how thin is that?! You could pack a tent in a thimble. Ooo! Gravity simulators. Terraforming, biospheres, nano-tech steel construction. This is brilliant. Do you know, with equipment like this you could, ooo, I don't know, move to another planet or something?
If only that were possible. Conditional clause.
He called you a grunt. Don't call Ross a grunt. He's nice. We like Ross. Look at this place.
I was just thinking. What a responsible eighteen year old. Inventing zero carbon cars? Saving the world.
Mmm, blinkered vision. Because ATMOS means more people driving. More cars, more petrol. End result, the oil's going to run out faster than ever. The ATMOS system could make things worse.
It's been a long time since anyone said no to you, isn't it?
Not easy, is it, being clever. You look at the world and you connect things, random things, and think, why can't anyone else see it? The rest of the world is so slow.
And you're all on your own.
But not with this. Because there's no way you invented this thing single handed. I mean, it might be Earth technology, but that's like finding a mobile phone in the Middle Ages. No, no, I'll tell you what it's like. It's like finding this in the middle of someone's front room. Albeit it's a very big front room.
Yeah, just looks like a thing, doesn't it? People don't question things. They just say, oh, it's a thing.
Me, I make these connections. And this, to me, looks like a teleport pod.
Oh.
How did he get in, in tru da window? Bye, bye!
Ross, get out! Luke, you've got to come with me.
Sontaran! That's your name, isn't it? You're a Sontaran. How did I know that, hey? Fascinating isn't it? Isn't that worth keeping me alive?
Well that's not going to work. Cordolaine signal, am I right? Copper excitation stopping the bullets.
Well.
But this isn't typical Sontaran behaviour, is it? Hiding? Using teenagers, stopping bullets? A Sontaran should face bullets with dignity. Shame on you.
Yeah? Then show yourself.
And your name?
Oh, that's not a very good nickname. What if you do get defeated? Staal the Not Quite So Undefeated Anymore But Never Mind?
Now, Ross, don't be rude. You look like a pink weasel to him.
The Sontarans are the finest soldiers in the galaxy, dedicated to a life of warfare. A clone race, grown in batches of millions with only one weakness.
No, it's a good weakness.
No, but the Sontarans are fed by a probic vent in the back of their neck. That's their weak spot. Which means, they always have to face their enemies in battle. Isn't that brilliant? They can never turn their backs.
Yeah? Well, stare at this.
Run!
Greyhound Forty to Trap One. Repeat, can you hear me? Over.
It must be the Sontarans. If they can trace that, they can isolate the ATMOS.
Try going right.
I know. So go right.
Ah, it's deadlocked. I can't stop it.
The sat-nav's just a box, wired through the whole car.
ATMOS, are you programmed to contradict my orders?
Anything I say, you'll ignore it?
Then drive into the river. I order you to drive into the river. Do it. Drive into the river.
Get down!
Oh, was that it?
You would not believe the day I'm having.
Anything without ATMOS. And don't point your gun at people.
Who? Oh, it's you.
Yeah, but don't shout it out. Nice to meet you properly, Wilf.
Donna, anything?
Sontarans. But there's got to be more to it. They can't be just remote controlling cars. That's not enough. Is anyone answering?
Martha, tell Colonel Mace it's the Sontarans. They're in the file. Code Red, Sontarans. But if they're inside the factory tell them not to start shooting. UNIT will get massacred. I'll get back as soon as I can.
You got that?
Yeah, but now I know it's Sontaran, I know what I'm looking for.
She takes care of me.
Whoa. It's a temporal pocket. I knew there was something else in there. It's hidden just a second out of sync with real time.
Yeah, that's me.
Get back!
That'll stop it.
That wasn't just exhaust fumes, Some sort of gas. Artificial gas.
They've activated it!
It won't open! It's the whole world.

Crew of the freighter safely returned to their own time.
We feel his loss as well.
No.
And change your own history?
Now listen to me, both of you. There are some rules that cannot be broken even with the Tardis. Don't ever ask me to do anything like that again. You must accept that Adric is dead. His life wasn't wasted. He died trying to save others, just like his brother, Varsh. You know, Adric had a choice. This is the way he wanted it.
And me. But he wouldn't want us to mourn unnecessarily.
Special treat to cheer us all up.
Hyde Park, the Crystal Palace.
All the wonders of Victorian science and technology.
How about opening day? Pass the time of day with the foreign royals. We could even drop in at Lords, see a few overs from Wisden and Pilch. I wonder if the Lion will be bowling?
Yes, all right.
Nyssa, have you touched the dimensional stabilisers?
It could be the relative drift compensator.
Feedback from the solar comparator? No.
Another ship? What do you mean, another ship?
If we don't materialise, the Tardis will be destroyed.
Seems to have done the trick.
Somewhere above Hyde Park. The view should be spectacular.
You're right.
Coordinate override. A sort of anti-collision device.
So I have.
Well, we'll only be here a moment. I hope.
I am. Ah!
I won't be a moment.
I don't know what English cricket is coming to.
Hmm?
Well, I try to be.
Nonsense. We'll be away from here in no time.
Is that a good idea?
Yes, of course. Security.
UNIT.
You'd do much better to check with UNIT, department C19. Sir John Sudbury is the man you want.
Oh, just tell him it's the Doctor. And do send my regards to Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart. Unless, of course, he's a General by now.
You see? What did I say. We'll be gone in a couple of shakes.
Be quiet, I'm thinking.
Well, we will, eventually.
Look, Tegan, this is your planet. I would have thought you wanted to help.
Well, I might be able to help.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Hello. And this is Nyssa and Tegan.
Now, I believe you're having problems with Concorde.
Disappeared?
Indeed. I wonder.
Remember the turbulence we experienced?
Yes. I wonder very much indeed.
Exactly.
I suspect it's not a question of where, but er, when.
We must follow the same route, same height, same speed, and with my equipment on board I can identify what I believe to be an exponential time contour.
Exactly. And we can't have a navigational hazard like that hanging about the galaxy.
And this is Nyssa and Tegan.
Right.
It would seem to be the logical explanation.
Ah, you're forgetting the Tardis.
That's right.
It's amazing.
This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside.
Wait here.
So useful when you want to maintain a dignified attitude.
Concorde has just flown into the time contour.
Oh, I doubt it, Captain. It's simply reacting to centuries of galactic radiation through which we're passing.
I'm afraid your radio is useless, Captain. By my estimation we're the spatial equivalent of four hundred billion miles from Air Traffic Control.
That's why this tree doth continue to be since observed by yours faithfully, God.
To be is to be perceived. A naive eighteenth century philosophy.
Nothing there. I wonder. Perceptual induction.
I want you all to concentrate very hard.
Concentrate. Look at anything. Observe it in every detail.
Perceptual induction. And I'm undoing it. Concentrate! It's the only way to fight it and find out where we really are.
No, you think you're at Heathrow. So did I. Well, almost, up to a moment ago. Now concentrate, all together. It must be a concerted effort.
You see? The coherence is breaking up.
Just where you thought we were, Captain.
Some a hundred and forty million years ago.
Quite the reverse, Mister Scobie. You've just woken up.
Definitely Jurassic. There's a nip in the air, though. We can't be far off the Pleistocene era.
It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf. Better watch out for the odd brontosaurus.
I doubt it, but I should think they came from this time zone.
Have you another explanation?
Very violently, by the look of it.
It's like having a tooth out under hypnosis. You don't feel a thing.
So was the Indian rope trick.
Oh, don't worry, Captain, we'll find them. Let's hope no one finds us first.
Behind every illusion there's a conjurer. In this case, I shouldn't think he went to all this trouble for our entertainment.
Tegan, wait! All of you, stay here.
I doubt it. The illusion is always one of normality.
I think the answer might be over there.
Been here a long time.
Are you sure it wasn't an illusion?
Captain Stapley, are you all right?
What creatures?
Oh, you mean the Plasmatons.
Protein agglomeration. Random particles assembled from the atmosphere. Quite harmless, I assure you.
Oh, isn't there? Now what about the energy that telepathically generated the idea that we were at Heathrow? You think that can't operate on a physical level?
It's simply a form of psychokinesis.
What?
Didn't you even bother to look to see where they were taking it?
And this is Nyssa and Tegan.
Yes. I'm sorry if we seem like an unlikely rescue party.
Well, don't worry. You're not imagining us.
Who are they, Professor Hayter?
Guards? Oh, you mean the Plasmatons.
Oh, it doesn't matter. At least you managed to get away without alerting these guards. Look, I want you to show us the way to this mausoleum.
And I've got to find my Tardis.
Come on, then.
Keep still.
Who are you?
The intelligence. It's using Nyssa as a medium.
Be quiet. Who are you? What do you want?
Someone wanted to stop her talking.
I'm afraid we don't have the right kind of energy.
Well, if we could find the source of the power, we might be able to free her.
Tegan's right. Look, she'll be perfectly all right. As soon as she's free, you both go back to the Concorde.
And don't try and follow us. Captain, Professor.
Is that a reason for abandoning your fellow passengers?
Something with the same resource of psychokinetic energy.
It could well be.
Those guards, as you call them, are fully occupied with Nyssa.
The creatures you saw are particles of protoplasm bonded by psychic energy. The essential protoplasm can take any shape.
Yes, but I suspect the power and raw material is limited, so as long as Nyssa is trapped
Scientifically speaking, I think we should find the others.
I wonder if they know where the Tardis is?
It can't be far away.
So you're the conjurer.
You say that as if you expect a round of applause.
Your domain?
Well, I apologise for my levity, not to mention my curiosity.
What you're doing in this time zone, for a start.
Would the spirit have anything to do with the ruins of that spaceship out there?
Yes.
Ah. Then exactly how do you travel?
Magic? Arabia? Oh, come on, you can do better than that.
Oh yes, yes, you're surrounded by a lot of powerful bioenergetics, Kalid, but I can't help feeling there's something a great deal more mechanistic about all this.
What are you doing, sitting at the end of a time contour like a spider in a web? And what do you want with my Tardis?
Your spirits are very well-informed.
Not just me, Kalid. What do you want with all these passengers?
You have the Plasmatons.
You mean you need the psychotronic energy for something else.
We?
You can exclude me from your wizardry.
Very impressive, Kalid, but your incantation is just triggering someone else's energy. You're not in control here. You're just as mortal as anyone else.
I've always found domination such an unattractive prospect.
There is no power that will give you control of the Tardis.
Kalid.
No!
He's thrown up a barrier. I did try and warn you.
You're wasting your time, Kalid.
I've already told you
Out of bounds, are they, Kalid?
You mean you've not been able to.
Well, Kalid, it seems a power greater than yours is protecting them.
It's your powerhouse, is it?
No.
I don't think so. We've all got quite good at resisting your sorcery.
I'm not so sure about this one.
Kalid is drawing on deeper reserves of power, and that thing is bonding itself into something far more dangerous than a Plasmaton.
The answer is still no, Kalid.
The power's gone.
You won't find what you're looking for.
I don't understand.
So you escaped from Castrovalva. I should have guessed.
The crystal is simply a point of focus. The communication is purely telepathic.
What indeed.
These components are from your Tardis. You're stranded here! The time contour you generated was a desperate lifeline to the future. It accidentally converged with Concorde.
For a new source of power? I think you're too late. It seems to have expended itself.
Oh, they're as likely to have been protected as destroyed. The power works against as well as for you.
No heroics, please, gentlemen. The Master will eliminate you without a second thought.
Not exactly the first class end of the market, but a serviceable vehicle, Captain.
I do not wish to believe, therefore I hallucinate. Is that the philosophy of Darlington men, Professor?
Try telling that to Tegan and Nyssa when the Master materialises in the sanctum.
The power source is unstable. Sometimes it works for the Master, sometimes against.
I don't know, but I intend to find out.
No, no. Just the Professor and myself.
You've seen the hallucinogenic effects the power source can have. The closer you get, the stronger it is. You wouldn't be able to resist.
The Professor has shown stronger resistance than most. By the way, if the Master turns up again, don't be surprised. It may take him a little time to discover I left the er, coordinate override switched in. Ready?
The Master was so desperate to penetrate the sanctum he resorted to brute force.
Exactly.
Let's hope they still have enough strength left to break down the wall for us.
I don't know.
That's not necessarily a good thing.
Are you any good at explanations?
Are your passengers unharmed?
Oh, I'm sure of it. Either they've been press-ganged into other work or they're locked up safely out of harm's way.
The Master's Tardis.
Of course. That's where he's hidden the other passengers.
Something else for me to explain later.
The time. Yes, that's another thing.
What's this?
I want to see where this goes.
An induction loop! So that's how he generated the time contour. Don't you see what this means?
He's already harnessing the power in the loop, in the chamber, in the sanctum!
The wall is much more important. Tegan and Nyssa are behind it.
Now, you don't have to come in if you don't want to.
Good man. The rest of you stay here.
They're just stunned.
Are you all right?
You rest a while.
Look in the sarcophagus, Professor.
An immeasurable intelligence at the centre of a psychic vortex, all seeing, all knowing.
It didn't. That's why it deflected your attack.
A massive burst of psychokinetic energy.
The power diverted to defend itself.
Jekyll and Hyde.
Oh, not the creature itself. The power was being used by the Master.
Part of the benign intelligence must have triggered a hidden mechanism.
We had to force our way in.
The power must be returning.
Well, someone filled in the hole.
Whatever part of the intelligence that is now controlling them wants us walled up in here.
Till the Master turns up with the Tardis.
The Xeraphin.
A legendary race, long since extinct.
They're supposed to have lived on the planet Xeraphas, before it was devastated by crossfire in the Vardon-Kosnax war.
Oh, there's nothing green about the Xeraphin, I assure you. Highly developed creatures. Beings with immense mental power.
It's the weapon I warned you against. If the Master used it on you, you'd end up just like this. They must have come out of the casket.

The whole race physically amalgamated into one organism with one immense personality. That's why the Master came here. That's why he laid this loop around the chamber. He wants this at the centre of his Tardis.
He must have exhausted his own dynomorphic generator.
And infinitely more powerful.
We must find a way out of here.
No, Nyssa, you'll be absorbed.
No, stop! Nyssa, talk to me. Explain it to me.
But the knowledge will consume you!
No, Professor.
It will destroy you. You don't understand what you're doing.
Professor Hayter, get back from there!
The molecular structure has completely broken up.
I think the Xeraphin is trying to materialise.
What are the Xeraphin doing on Earth, Anithon?
Radiation poisoning.
You achieved the absorption of a whole race into a single bioplasmic body?
What went wrong?
The Master.
We've seen their remains.
How did the Master gain so much control over your psychic power?
But surely there's more good than evil in the Xeraphin? And the good is controlling the power that helped Tegan and Nyssa, and is still resisting the Master.
We'll have to deal with the Master first.
Zarak, that's just a dream. The Master will use the power for his own evil purposes. He'll never allow you to regenerate.
The argument, of course. The debate between black and white Xeraphin. Whichever Xeraphin wins will control their combined power.
Zarak is summoning other evil Xeraphin.
How can we help you?
You must.
The Master's perfected the induction loop.
It means the Master has finally defeated me.
With the Xeraphin at the centre of his Tardis, there's no limit to his powers.
Well, it would help if you could remember where you came in.
Then we have to resort to brute force.
How do you suggest we make contact?
Captain Stapley!
My dear Captain, you really are the most remarkable man to pilot the Tardis, and with such precision. Perhaps you could take us to the other side of that wall.
You have control, as they say.
No.
Possibly a telepathic projection. Perhaps he isn't really dead.
Hello.
Have you seen another Tardis?
Could well be.
I don't think so. He's still in this time zone. He can't be far away.
In it's new state, the Master's Tardis won't be fully operational yet. He's got the nucleus all right, but he'll need to work on it.
The passengers.
Captain, your passengers are now in greater danger than ever before.
I'll explain later. Nyssa, I want you to take the Tardis back to the Concorde cargo hold. Captain, I want you and your crew to get your aircraft ready for takeoff immediately.
Wing and a prayer, Captain.
Well, I'm sure you'll do your very best. Tegan, come with me. Nyssa, the coordinates are all set.
Keep your eyes open. The Master could be anywhere.
And taken everything with him, including the bits of my Tardis.
Molecular disintegration. That way the Master has a neat little store of protoplasm with which he can do anything he wants.
In a manner of speaking. Let's get back to Captain Stapley.
There's something wrong.
No. No, you can't, can you. Come on.
I'll explain later. Where's my Tardis?
Hmm. Captain, is your aircraft all right?
Ah. Not a good idea.
If that were Concorde.
That aircraft was damaged. Now it's in perfect condition.
I'm afraid not. That's the Master's Tardis.
The Master's operated his chameleon circuit.
Is inside the Master's Tardis, of course. I wish I had time to explain dimensional transcendentalism. Look, I'm going into my Tardis. You stay here.
There's no other way.
There's no time for anything else.
Without the bits he stole from my Tardis, we can only travel in this time zone.
I'm afraid so.
And so, it would see, is the Master. Come on!
A technical hitch?
Ah. Well, that's the way it goes if you will steal other people's property. (turns around) What's he talking about, Nyssa? Have you been tampering with the Tardis?
Have you any idea what would have happened if I'd tried to go
You, Captain?
Stupid? It was brilliant. (to the Master) Your prospects seem rather limited.
Ah, but such a restricted range.
You return all the passengers, we have access to both aircraft, you return all the components of my Tardis not necessary for the normal functioning of your machine.
A temporal limiter.
He'll never give that up. Without it his Tardis is useless.
Well, we'll know that in a moment.
Captain, I'll need your aircraft ready for takeoff as soon as possible.
Now, you two. Stay here.
You seem to have mislaid the quantum accelerator.
If you'd be so good as to follow me.
Right. I'll run a line from the Tardis. Oh, you'll need a compressed air supply.
And he hasn't got the temporal limiter. The idea, you see, is to keep him waiting until we're ready to take off.
No. I need the Tardis to deal with the Master.
I'm thinking about it.
Good. I just need a few more minutes.
Oh. Well, we'd better not keep him waiting.
Please.
The temporal limiter.
Heathrow, actually.
He's virtually running in a new Tardis. In order to check out the temporal dimensions, he'll need to track back the line of the time contour.
Yes.
Quite right. Shall we go on board?
Not with my temporal limiter in circuit.
Of course it does. You don't think I could fool the Master, do you? Mind you, there is an inhibition factor inherent in the er, programming.
He'll arrive after us.
Ready to go?
Ah. I'll just programme your flight computer.
Now, as we dematerialise, we reverse the process of the time contour and kick Concorde back onto its original flight path.
With a bit of luck.
Well, it's Heathrow Airport. We appear to be on schedule for a change.
Ah. Now what we need's a diversion. Now, with a bit of luck, not to mention judgement.
No. Same coordinates as the Tardis, but we got here first. Just.
Knocked back into time-space like a straight six into the pavilion.
Oh, they stand a much better chance on their own planet.
That was millions of years ago. The atmosphere will be perfectly clear by now. Not a very nice climate for the Master, though.
Well, I think with that extra energy on board, my temporal limiter will need replacing.
Yes. Let's hope it's for good. Now, where's Tegan?
Ah, well, really, Officer, we're, we're just in transit, as it were.
Er, just a, just a. Captain Stapley, I trust you had a good flight?
(to policeman) Er, you know my friend the Airport Controller. I'm sure he can give you a full explanation.
Er, well, I'll just make a quick phone call, which should clear the whole thing up.

Oh, ho, ho.
You are going to love it. One, two, three!
Everything all right?
What was that for?
Just got lucky, this thing. It's one of the Trickster's Brigade. Changes a life in tiny little ways. Most times, the universe just compensates around it, but with you? Great big parallel world.
They are. But you had one created around you. Funny thing is, seems to be happening a lot to you.
Well, The Library and then this.
Sometimes I think there's way too much coincidence around you, Donna. I met you once, then I met your grandfather, then I met you again. In the whole wide universe, I met you for a second time. It's like something's binding us together.
Yes, you are. You're brilliant.
Who did?
Well, she never existed now.
Yeah, but that world's gone.
Who was she?
What did she look like?
What was her name?
Donna, what was her name?
What two words? What were they? What did she say?
It's the end of the universe.

Hmm?
If you want to.
Affect this? No, it's a yo-yo. It's a game. I thought you were enjoying it.
Magic, Leela? Magic?
Exactly. To the rational mind nothing is inexplicable, only unexplained.
Hmm? All right, I'll show you. It's because insides and outsides are not in the same dimension.
Which box is larger?
Now which one is larger?
But it looks smaller.
Exactly. If you could keep that exactly that distance away and have it here, the large one would fit inside the small one.
That's transdimensional engineering, a key Time Lord discovery.
This is the exciting bit.
Seeing what's outside.
I don't. It's metal. We've landed inside something metal.
One box inside another. I just explained it to you.
Well, it's a rather dull subject anyway. I wonder where we are?
Well, not precisely, no.
Well, of course I can control it. Nine times out of ten. Well, seven times out of ten. Five times. Look. Never mind, let's see where you are.
You won't need that.
I never carry weapons. If people see you mean them no harm, they never hurt you. Nine times out of ten.
It's basically hardened alloy. Scored all over. It must come in under great pressure.
Whatever it is they fill it up with.
This is very interesting.
It comes in here.
Whatever it is.
Desert. Either that or the tide's gone out.
There's no water, so nothing grows. Nothing at all, by the look of it.
Hmm. A bit garish for my taste.
Hmm? Looks like dust. It's a sandstorm. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on! This is a sandminer. We're in one of the scoops.
The storm could be travelling at a thousand miles an hour. The sand will cut us to pieces unless we get back to the Tardis. Come on!
We've been robbed!
The shutters!
If there are no manual controls, we're dead!
There must be a way out.
Well, we can't get out of it until we find the Tardis.
Because robots are programmed to help people, not hurt them. You won't hurt us, will you?
Mineral extraction. The surface of this planet is a sea of sand
Probably several miles deep and constantly moving. And I imagine contains valuable metallic elements, otherwise they wouldn't go to all this trouble.
Yes. I have seen a similar sort of thing on Korlano Beta. The mine passes over the surface searching for useful ores. Naturally, the heavier elements tend to sink into the substratas, so a really good sandstorm is a bonus. It stirs things up a bit.
Thank you.
Robots don't have feelings. It's the people they serve we must hope are friendly.
What? Robots don't need chairs, and certainly not padded ones.
Well, I'm the Doctor, and that's Leela. I wonder if it's possible for us to speak to the person in charge? I'd like to thank him for saving our lives.
Well, thank you for saving our lives.
Trying to get out.
First we find the Tardis, then we have a little scout round, and we'll be back before they know.
Hello, my dear old thing.
The ore comes in under pressure from the separators. I wonder what it is, Leela. What do you think. Leela? Leela? I wish that girl wouldn't wander off like that.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, don't ask me such silly questions. How did you know I was in there?
Well, I'm not surprised. There's a dead man in there. Murdered. Strangled. Look.
Oh.
Is the robot command circuit routed only through you?
Easy now. Don't get excited.
Would you like a jelly baby?
A simple no thank you would have been sufficient.
I'm fine.
Shush. It's because they're frightened. That's why they're dangerous.
I'm the Doctor. I assume you're in command here.
Just standing here talking to you.
No doubt you would.
Well, we're travellers. We came here by accident.
Well, it's a small world.
Oh sorry, I thought it was a rhetorical question. Yes, it's just a coincidence.
No, that's an inference. I wasn't hiding that body, I was finding it, and I'd say it was put there for precisely that reason. Someone wanted to kill me, too.
To put suspicion onto me.
A dead stowaway.
Well, yes, now you come to mention it, I do remember once
Er, ahem. There is one other possibility you seem to have overlooked.
You know, you're a classic example of the inverse ratio between the size of the mouth and the size of the brain.
Thank you.
Yes, I just want to scratch.
Of course not.
Yes, then locked the molecular structure. The result's bands as solid as cast iron.
I wouldn't say that.
Concentrating. Whatever's locked can always be unlocked. It's just a matter of thinking out the right combination.
No more than two or three weeks.
Well, there are several million combinations to think through.
I'm taking it very, very seriously. I have an uncomfortable feeling that if the murderer doesn't kill us, the Commander will. That is, assuming they're not one and the same person.
You could undo these clamps.
Are you a hunter, Poul?
That concerns you?
Well (cough).
Thank you. One of your robots could have done it.
I know, I know, I know. It's the first programme that's laid into any robot's brain from the simplest Dumb to the most complex Super Voc. But suppose, suppose someone's found a way of bypassing it.
Bumble-bees.
Terran insects. Aerodynamically impossible for them to fly, but they do it. I'm rather fond of bumble-bees. Come on. There's something I want to look at.
Tell us about it. What was his name?
Who found him?
So whoever killed him was strong. Too strong for him to resist.
What do you think he was doing here?
Where was he found?
Is that one of his packages?
Good. Imagine you're Chub. There's a storm coming up. Pass me one of those packages.
Come on, come on. In those circumstances you're in a hurry. What would you do?
What do you mean, I can't imagine what it'll mean? This isn't the only robot dependent civilisation in the galaxy, you know.
Sit down. Sit down. What did you call those robots?
Yes. You know, people never really lose that feeling of unease with robots. The more of them there are, the greater the unease and of course the greater the dependence. It's a vicious circle. People can neither live with them nor exist without them.
Oh, I should think it's the end of this civilisation.
That's true.
You're letting your imagination run away with you.
No, I can't. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. No, I can't, and neither can you.
Please don't say I told you so.
Come on.
What happened?
Never mind about that. What's happening?
You'll have to cut the power.
If you don't, she'll blow herself to pieces.
I know what you're thinking, but we had nothing to do with it.
It's a gift! May I remind you we'll all go together when she blows if you don't cut the power!
What's the limit before the motive units explode?
Severance kit. Severance kit, quickly.
Fighting sabotage with sabotage.
What?
There's nothing for it! You've got to cut the zeta links!
Good man. Now the other one.
Good. Now our troubles really begin.
I like a man who stays calm, Dask, but this isn't the Titanic.
Well, if the damaged motive units can be repaired, the mine can float itself.
I'll give you a hand with the diatrodes.
I'm sure Dask knows exactly where to look for the damage.
You've got nothing to do now, Toos. Look after her, Leela.
Do you know what I think?
I think he's very clever. Hello, Toos, how's the arm? Did you do that?
I want you to stay with Poul. Don't let him out of your sight.
He's not telling the whole truth.
I think I'll go and talk to your dumb friend.
Yes.
Professional interest or morbid curiosity? Which? There are three types of robots aboard this mine. Dumbs, Vocs, a Super Voc, and then there's you. Would you care to explain that? I see. Well then, perhaps I'd better tell SV7 you can talk.
That's better. Well?
Oh, but you can. You can.
You're a robot detective. What does your computer mind make of this?
Typical robot. No imagination.
The Company took those threatening letters seriously. Seriously enough to put you on board.
Taren Capel.
Taren Capel. Scientist. In what field? Robotics.
And you're still looking for evidence?
If I knew you had the power to, I'd listen.
What does Taren Capel look like?
Oh, that's dim. Even for a Dumb, that's dim. You realise he's almost certainly on board.
But you don't know what he looks like.
Before they came on board?
Yes, you had.
Yes. Oh, come on. Don't be upset. Yes, you failed, you failed, but congratulations. Failure's one of the basic freedoms. Listen. Do you think that looks a likely place?
Well, if Taren Capel is on board, he'd have a workshop, and we must find it before it's too late. Would you like to come with me?
Good. Come on then.
Ah!
That was me.
That was me!
That was me.
Yes, this is the place.
About this? Well, it's a reasonable assumption.
What? Because modifying brains isn't something you do standing around in corridors, you know.
Do you know what that is?
Yes, that's right. No handyman should be without one. It's been used. Perhaps we're too late. Somehow we've got to warn the others.
I'm sorry about that, D84.
Toos? Pilot Toos?
Toos?
It's the Doctor. Listen, Toos. I now know it's the robots who are doing the killing.
Well of course they can, if they're modified to it, and some of them have been. Where are you?
Are you alone?
Listen carefully, Toos. This is what I want you to do.
Get to the Command deck. Take Leela, Dask, Poul, everyone, and get them to the Command deck. Get the robots out of there and secure the doors. Is that clear?
Just do it, Toos.
What is it, Toos?
What's outside?
Are you sure?
Good.
Help is on the way.
It is hurrying.
Why? Does it upset you?
That's far enough. What are you doing here?
Ah. I'd come over here, if I were you. Slowly.
Now either it followed you, or else it homed in on this. It depends which of us is going to be killed first. That is, you or me.
Finish it off before it's too late.
The probe stopped. Can you do it?
Take care.
Don't just stand there, Seven. Give me a hand.
Just how fast are these robots?
No, I meant fast as in nimble. Never mind, we'll soon find out.
Come on, we've got to get back to the Command deck.
It hasn't gone bad, it's command circuit's been changed.
Taren Capel could.
Yes, the mad scientist. Very mad scientist.
Of course. There had to be one. I should have thought of that before.
Safe? Safe?
Uvanov, you remind me very strongly of a lady called Marie Antoinette. There's a robot revolution going on out there and you say we've got no problems.
Uvanov! Look over there.
Shut the door, Toos. I may not have time to explain. There's a new generation of killer robots about, Uvanov. The killers are controlled by Taren Capel, and D84 is controlled by Poul. These two are undercover agents for the Company.
Yes, that's very likely.
Well, his body language was all wrong.
Well, it's a theory that a person expresses himself in the way he moves.
Yes, you did. Do you know what's wrong with Poul, Uvanov?
That's right. The Loid call it Grimwade Syndrome.
Oh, yes, yes, it is, until one gets its hands around your neck. I don't suppose there are any weapons aboard this mine?
They are now.
Five minutes. And the anti-blast doors will hold another ten. Anti-blast. Do you carry blasting powder aboard this mine?
What, in here?
They might work, Uvanov. If you could pass a positive charge through the metal plate, you'd be able to magnetise them and have anti-robot bombs.
Well that's your problem. I can't be everywhere at once. Toos, open this door for me.
The robot mortuary. Toos, lock this door after us and don't let anyone in, is that clear?
D84 and Leela. Remember, Toos. If we don't come back, you'll have to find some other way of warning the outside world.
Ten robots.
Strange, I would have expected Taren Capel to be in at the kill. Come on, we've got to hurry.
D84, do you know the storage bay where Chub kept his equipment?
There are some canisters of gas there. Fetch me on, please, as fast as you can.
Yes, Borg's at a guess. He was strong enough to put up a struggle.
Yes, that's what probably triggered his collapse.
It's an unreasoning dread of robots. You see, most living creatures use non-verbal signals. Body movement, eye contact, facial expression, that sort of thing.
Exactly. While these robots are humanoid, presumably for aesthetic reasons, they give no signals. It's rather like being surrounded by walking, talking, dead men.
Yes. It undermines a certain type of personality, causes identity crisis, paranoia, sometimes even personality disintegration.
Robophobia. At least, that's Grimwade's theory. Hold this.
I'm going to try and patch this communicator into Dask's private command circuit.
Yes. Taren Capel. If I can discover where he modified this. Do you have to talk so much?
There, that should do it.
Yes, planning to modify them and reactivate them later. Today the mind, tomorrow the world. Right now he must be a happy little maniac.
Yes. Well done, D84. Now you're going to have to stay here.
D84, this is a final deactivator. If I have to use this and you're around, it'll destroy your brain.
What? I think you're very important.
All right, but you be very careful.
Good. Come on.
Come on. Hold this, D84, and don't press anything.
To make life a little difficult for our crazy friend. He's bound to come back here to convert more robots and when he does. Do you think you could fit in there, Leela?
Come on, try it for size.
Never mind. Comfortable?
Now this is a cylinder of gas. When Dask comes in, I want you to turn the valve, so.
No, when Dask comes in.
Hmm?
Change his voice.
When a mixture of air and helium is breathed, it alters the resonance in the larynx. Didn't they teach you that in the jungle?
That's it.
Come on, D84.
Shush. Robot hunting.
D84!
Hello, Dask. Nee Taren Capel.
Oh? Why?
I see. You're one of those boring maniacs who's going to gloat, hmm? Are you going to tell me your plan for running the universe? (Dask's voice starts to go up in pitch as the helium takes effect.)
Dask. Dask! You look ridiculous in that outfit. Not half the robot your father was.
Losing your calm, Dask, hmm? That's not the robot way. It was your verbal and physical precision that made me spot you. Robot upbringing?
Robots would have no existence without humans. Don't you see that, Dask?
You'll be all right, Toos.
Well, all good things come to an end.
Ah, a mouse in the wainscoting.
Well squeaked, mouse.
Oh no, there's a rescue ship on the way, and it's time we were on ours.
Because I'm a Time Lord. I've been around, you know. Two hearts, respiratory bypass system. I haven't lived seven hundred and fifty years without learning something. After you. Little mouse.

Bye, then. Lovely meeting you. Sorry about the mess.
You've got the Egyptian people to rule, Queen Nefertiti. They'll need reassuring after that weapon-bearing giant alien locust attack we just stopped rather brilliantly.
Oh dear, sorry. I've got it set to Temporal News For You. That's interesting.
Nothing. Not interesting. Not at all. Ooo, never been there. Exciting! I'm off!
Coming!
A ship the size of Canada coming at Earth very fast. Any signs of life?
Crikey, Charlie, look at that. Ooo, I know someone who'd love to have a look at that. And the Ponds. Mustn't forget the Ponds, Neffy. Haven't seen them in ages. I'm riffing. People usually stop me when I'm riffing or carry on without me. That's also an option.
She's with me. Good question, Neffy.
Oh, Indira, I liked you before you said missiles. How long till the ship gets that close?
Right. Better get a shift on, then. Leave it with us. Come on, Neffy. We're going to need help.
More stew?
Riddell, listen. I've found, well, something.
I've no idea. Do you want to find out?
Hello! You weren't busy, were you? Well, even if you were, it wasn't as interesting as this probably is. Didn't want you to miss it. Now, just a quick hop.
Everybody grab a torch.
Spiders. Don't normally get spiders in space.
Don't move! Do you really think I'm that stupid I wouldn't notice? How did you get aboard, eh? Transmat? Who sent you?
Well frankly, that's outrageous.
You think you can just bring your dad along without asking? I'm not a taxi service, you know.
Oh. Well, that's fine, then. My mistake. Hello, Brian. How are you? Nice to meet you. Welcome, welcome. This is the gang. I've got a gang. Yes. Come on then, everyone.
Well, I sense it's orbiting. More like pre-crashing. On a spaceship, don't know, and hello, Pond. Ten months. Time flies. Never really understood that phrase. This is Neffy, this is Riddell. They're with me.
No. They're just people. They're not Ponds. I thought we might need a new gang. Not really had a gang before. It's new.
It's coming down.
No idea.
Run!
I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship!
Or not. We've just found dinosaurs in space. We need to preserve them.
[on screen]: Well, there's so much to discover. Think how wise we'll be by the end of all this.
Brian, please, that would be ridiculous. They're probably just passengers. Did I mention missiles?
Didn't want to worry you. Anyway, six hours is a lifetime. Not literally a lifetime. That's what we're trying to avoid. And we're all really clever. Ooo, let's see what we can find out. Come on.
Oh, well done, whoever you are. Looking for engines. Thank you, computer. Look at that. Different sections have engines, but these look like the primary clusters. Where are we now, computer? We need to get down to these engines.
Find out. What?
Teleport. Oh, I hate teleports. Must have activated on my voice.
Is he all right?
What did you bring him for?
Well, it's not Earth. Doesn't taste right. Too metallic.
I do hope so.
Is it? Oh yes. Right, well, don't just stand there, you two. Dig. I'm going to look at rocks. Love a rock.
I do!
See? Metal floors, screens in rocks. It was just a matter of a short range teleport. We're still on the ship.
Well, it is quite ridiculous. Also brilliant. That's why the system teleported us here. I wanted the engines. This is the engine room! Hydrogenerators! Ha!
Fabulously impossible. Oh, think of the things we could learn from this ship if we manage to stop it being blown to pieces.
Bad news, can't shut the wave system down in time. Takes, takes way too long.
Exactly. That's what we need to find. Now, what do we do about the things that aren't kestrals?
Yes. On any other occasion, I'd be thrilled. Exposed on a beach, less thrilled. We should be going.
Er, definitely away from them.
That's the plan. Amendments welcome. Move away from the pterodactyls.
Amendment one, run!
No! Local teleport burnt out on arrival. There's something in the cliffs over there.
Through the cave. Come on.
That suggestion was a work in progress.
Yes, thanks for spelling it out.
Spelling it out is hereditary. Wonderful.
Why do we want to escape?
Oh, you see? He's so clever. I've missed you, Rory.
They wouldn't do that. You're not going to kill us, are you, Rusty?
Have you seen yourselves lately?
Ooo!
Herbivore. Don't panic. Triceratops. Ha! Beautiful.
Roar yourself. Hello, cutie. Good boy. Who's a lovely Tricy then? Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
You don't have any vegetable matter in your trousers, do you, Brian?
I'm sorry?
Oh, bless.
Throw one.
And breath out. Right, take us to your leader.
Too good to resist.
Love what you've done to the place down here.
It's fine. It's fine.
Fantasia in F minor for four hands.
Know it? Say hello to hands three and four. Schubert kept tickling me to try to put me off. Franz the hands. Oh, that takes me back. Well, this is cosy.
Is it? I'm the Doctor.
What's that?
What happened to you?
Ah yes, the robots. They're unusual.
Oh. A doctor doctor. I see. Let's have a look.
Yes. Very nasty.
If you tell me how you came by so many dinosaurs.
What?
I don't respond well to violent, Solomon.
Oh, I never talk about myself with a gun pointed at me. Let's talk about you. Your cosy little craft embedded in a vast old ship.
I'm a Sagittarius, probably.
A commerce colony. You're a trader.
Ah, the purple light. That's what it was. An IV system, identifying value. The database of everything across space and time allocated a market value. Argos for the universe. You were trying to find out how much I'm worth.
That's me. Worthless. Unlike these creatures you have on board. Very valuable, given they're extinct. Done. Sit up, very slowly.
I need to take this.
Amy.
Where are they now?
I'll see you soon.
(sotto) Be ready.
What did you do to the Silurians?
Because you wanted the dinosaurs.
Piracy and then genocide.
Oh, I'm a very emotive man.
The creatures on board this ship are not objects to be sold or traded.
You said Roxborne Peninsula, so why are you heading to Earth? You're on the wrong course. Oh, you don't know how. Brilliant. You couldn't change the pre-programmed course without instructions. The ship defaulted, returned home. Oh dear. The Silurians outwitted you even after you'd massacred them, so now you're a prisoner on the ship you hijacked.
Little bit of news, Solomon. You're being targeted by missiles. Get off this ship while you still can.
Don't ever judge me by your standards.
Well, don't just stand there, Rory. (to robots) Hey, he wants to see you.
Just do exactly as I do.
Geronimo!
Go, Tricy. Run like the wind!
Quick, how do you start a Triceratops?
Go, Tricy.
Come on, Tricy, faster, baby!
I know!
Come on, Tricy. Where are the brakes?
Good. That worked. Okay. Er, where are we now? Ooo, incoming message from Earth. Hello, Earth, how's things?
No. No, no, no, don't do that. Everything's completely under control here. Turning round any moment. Need a bit of wriggle room on the timings.
You can. Of course you can. Tiny bit more time, Indira, please. This ship contains the most precious cargo.
No, Indira. Hey! Come back! Please!
That's very bad indeed. Completely unhelpful.
Good thinking, Rory.
Computer, show us weapons and defence systems.
Oh, well, that was a waste of time, wasn't it? Getting my hopes up like that.
Ah, they're ancient species, Rory. Still full of hope.
It's too late. It won't make any difference.
It won't work, Rory. The missiles are locked on.
I don't know. I don't know.
You won't get your precious cargo on board, though. Just be you and your metal tantrum machines.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No.
You must be very proud.
No.
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no way.
Listen to me. If you go with him, I can't guarantee your safety.
No. No debts. You don't owe me anything.
No, Neffy, Neffy.
Bingo.
Okay, control deck.
Come on. The missiles are locked onto us. We can't out-run them. We have to save the dinosaurs and get Nefertiti back from Solomon. Isn't it obvious?
Seventeen minutes before the missiles hit. We need to turn this ship around.
Ah, yes, but I didn't have this plan then, did I? Riddell? Keep an eye out for dinosaurs.
No killing any. Rory, Brian, get rid of the cobwebs.
No, don't be like that. Really unhelpful.
Parallel pilot compartments, both configured. Needs two operator of the same gene-chain. And that's why Solomon couldn't change the ship's course and neither can we.
What?
Brian Pond, you are delicious.
Course you are. Sit down, both of you, licketty split. The ship does all the engineering. The controls are straight forward. Even a monkey use them. Oh look, they're going to. Guys, come on. Comedy gold. Where's a Silurian audience when you need one. Anyway, two eye line screens. Velocity and trajectories. Steer away from the Earth. Try not to bump into the moon otherwise the races who live there will be livid.
Primary controls in the arms of the chairs. Principle's the same as any vehicle. Eight minutes forty five seconds.
Get us as far away as you can. Right, phase two sorted. Now for phase one.
Humans, you are so linear. Shine the torch in here.
Mixing my messages. How's the job?
I work best when I'm multitasking. Keep talking. How's the job?
You gave the last one up.
Right, so it's my fault now, is it?
I'm not, I promise. Really promise. The others, yeah, but not you. Rory and you, you have lives, have each other. I thought that's what we agreed.
No, come on, Pond. You'll be there till the end of me.
Don't.
Hello! Having trouble leaving?
Ship's still magnetised. Just couldn't bear to lose you.
Don't mess with Egyptian Queens, Solomon. I hope you've learnt that now.
Disabling this ship's signal and replacing it with the one from the Silurian ship. I send this craft off emitting the signal they're looking for, the missiles will follow. Hopefully, Siliurian ship safe, dinosaurs safe, everybody safe. Bit tight for time, though. Shouldn't really be chatting. Neffy, let's go. How remiss of me. Almost forgot. The thing about missiles, very literal. This is what they latch on to.
Now, one press of this and the ship's demagnetised.
Did the Silurians beg you to stop? Look, Solomon. The missiles. See them shine? See how valuable they are. And they're all yours.
Enjoy your bounty.
So, dinosaur drop off time.
Oh. Fine. Of course.
Right. Yes. I'm pretty busy anyway. I mean, I've got to drop everyone back.

Argh. What's happening? I wonder if we'll get back. Yes, one day. Argh. I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow.
The Flesh is struggling to cope with our past regenerations. Hold on.
Would you like a jelly baby?
Why? Why? Why?
Why what?
Hello. I'm the Doctor. No, let it go, we've moved on.
Hold on, hold on, you can stabilise.
I've reversed the jelly baby of the neutron flow. Would you like a Doctor, Doctor, I'm, I'm the. I can't.
No, listen, hold on. Hold on.
No! Argh.
Hello.
Cybermats.
Do we have time for this?
We make time. I'd like more proof that you're me. Cybermats.
Created by the Cybermen. They kill by feeding off brainwaves.
Rory and Amy, they may not trust both of us.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Inevitably.
I'm glad we're on the same
Wavelength. You see, great minds.
Exactly. So, what's the plan?
Save them all, humans and gangers.
Tall order. Sounds wonderful.
Is that what you were thinking? It's just so inspiring to hear me say it.
I know.
So, what now, Doctor?
Well, time to get cracking, Doctor.
Formulate a protocol.
Protocol? Very posh.
A protocol between us. Otherwise
It gets horribly embarrassing.
And potentially confusing.
That's sarcasm.
She's very good at sarcasm.
We have to get you off this island. And the Gangers too.
They're scared.
Right, See, I don't think so. The Flesh Bowl is fed by cabling from above.
But where are the earthing conduits?
All this piping must go down into a tunnel or a shaft or something, yes? With us?
Yowza. An escape route.
You know, I'm starting to get a sense of just how impressive it is to hang out with me.
Do we tend to say yowza?
That's enough, let it go, okay? We're under stress.
No, this place is a maze. Takes a long time to find someone in a maze. I bet you lot have got a computer map, haven't you?
Very important, Pond. Breathe.
Acid interacting with the stone.
Creating an asphyxiant miasma.
Choking gas. Extra heavy. If we can get above it.
Oh, there's always some power floating around.
Sticking to the wires, like bits of lint.
Sentences? No probs.
Yes.
Nah, she's a tough old thing. Tough, old, sexy.
Tough, dependable, sexy.
Well, because we are. I'm the Doctor.
Yeah and so am I. We both contain the knowledge of over nine hundred years of memory and experience.
We both wear the same bow tie, which is cool.
Because bow ties are
And always will be.
Well, it must've been after I examined it. Thus, a new, genuine Doctor was created.
Ta-da.
Well, okay. After the Flesh scanned me, I had an accident with a puddle of acid. Now, new shoes. A situation which did not confront me learned self here.
That satisfy you, Pond?
Interesting. You definitely feel more affection for him than me.
Being almost the Doctor's like being no Doctor at all.
You might as well call me Smith.
John Smith.
Yes! Communication a go-go.
Making a phone call.
No one yet. It's on delay.
Because, Amy, I am and always will be the optimist. The hoper of far-flung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams. The wheels are in motion. Done.
Hmm?
Amy? What happened?
It's who again?
It's nothing.
It's a time memory. Like a mirage. It's nothing to worry about.
It's in my head.
Why?
Why?
It's all the eyes say. Why? I can feel them as they work each day, knowing the time was coming for them to be thrown away again. Not again, please. And then they are destroyed and they feel death, and all they can say is, why?
Why?
Did you sense it?
Briefly. Not as strong as you.
Amy, I'm sorry.
It would appear I can connect to the Flesh.
I'm beginning to understand what it's been through, what it needs.
It's much more powerful than we thought. The Flesh can grow, correct?
Well, now it wants to do that at will. It wants revenge. It's in pain, angry. It wants revenge.
Hold on a minute, hold your horses. I thought I'd explained this. I'm him, he's me.
Don't be so absurd.
Nice barrel, very comfy. Why not? Is this really what you want?
We could use the sonic to track him. Humans and Gangers give off slightly different signals. The sonic needs to tell the difference.
He is the Doctor.
Sure you're not prejudiced?
Am I crazy, Doctor?
Well, you did want to plumb your brain into the core of an entire planet just to halt its orbit and win a bet.
Do you know, I want him to go. And I'm rather adamant.
Thank you, Buzzer. It'll be all right. I'll find him.
Can't explain it to you now, but I need you to trust him. Can you do that for me, Amy?
And now it's heating up the whole island. How long till it blows?
Cleaves? Cleaves? Cleaves, sit down.
It's a very deep parietal clot.
On Earth, yes.
Yeah, we can't stay here. Let's go.
Cleaves? Cleaves, it's dead. It's dead. We need to get out of here. We need to get back downstairs and get those vents back on. Come on.
I'm getting something.
Yeah, it's human, but it's fading. It's fading. This is bad. Fading is very bad. Argh. The signal's gone. She's dead.
She was hanging onto the edge of life and she just, just slipped away. Oh, Jennifer, I'm so sorry. She's been out here for hours.
Rory's in trouble.
Ah. The eyes have it.
To accuse us.
It's a chemical chain reaction now. I can't stop it. This place is going to blow sky high.
An hour? Five seconds? Er, somewhere in between.
Out!
Got anything for a sore head?
Call me Smith. John Smith.
Rory!
Rory Pond, Roranicus Pondicus!
Rory, there is no time. The factory's about to explode.
This is going to overheat and fill the room with acid, just as a point of interest.
Just as a point of interest? No.
She's gone, Rory. Gone.
If you have a better plan, I'm all ears. In fact, if you have a better plan, I'll take you to a planet where everyone is all ears.
Ring, ring.
Ring, ring.
Stay.
Ah, that'll be the phone. Somebody get the phone. Jimmy, get the phone. No? Fine, I'll get the phone. Stay put.
Ha! Hello, Adam, I'm the Doctor. Well, other Doctor. Or Smith. It's complicated and boring. Anyway, who cares. It's your birthday.
Yay. Now, have you been getting up very early and jumping on the bed?
I expect chocolate for breakfast. If you don't feel sick by mid-morning, you're not doing it right. Now, I think you want to speak to Dad.
You'll do, Jimmy. What does the other Jimmy matter now? You're both the same dad, aren't you? Come on, Adam's waiting.
No, I've helped him into an act of humanity. Anyone else like the sound of that? Act of humanity.
It doesn't have to be about revenge. It can be so much better than that.
There's nothing we can do. The acid's reached his heart.
Jimmy Wicks, you're a dad.
Daddy's coming home today, Adam.
Now we need to move.
Run. Run. Run! Ooo, roof's going to give.
Here she comes.
Oh, she does like to make an entrance.
Everyone move.
Go. Go, go, go.
I have to stay. Hold this door closed. Give you time to dematerialise.
Well, this place is just about to explode. But I can stop her.
Or perhaps you think I should stay instead? Mister Smith.
Amy, we swapped shoes.
I'm the Doctor.
And I'm the Flesh.
No, I'm not, and I haven't been all along.
I'm the original Doctor, Amy. We had to know if we were truly the same. It was important, vital we learn about The Flesh, and we could only do that through your eyes.
What?
Push, Amy. But only when she tells you to.
Well, my death arrives, I suppose.
But this one, we're not invited to.
Pardon?
Nothing. Your molecular memory can survive this, you know. It may not be the end.
Yeah, well, if I turn up to nick all your biscuits, then you'll know you were right, won't you.
You too, Cleaves. Off you pop.
This is not the time for grand gestures.
Foreman Miranda Cleaves, marvellous. Beware of imitations.
This will dissolve her.
There may be a way back from this.
Don't know. Let's find out, eh?
Geronimo.
The energy from the Tardis will stabilise the Gangers for good. They're people now.
Ah, that's not a problem. I have something for that. It's small and red and tastes like burnt onions. Ha. But it'll get rid of your blood clot.
Happy endings.
Your company's telling the world that the situation is over. You need to get in there and tell them that the situation's only just begun. Make them understand what they're doing to the Flesh. Make them stop. Dicken, remember, people are good. In their bones, truly good. Don't hate them, will you?
Yeah. And just remember, people died. Don't let that be in vain. Make what you say in that room count.
I said breathe, Pond. Remember? Well, breathe.
Breathe.
Get her into the Tardis.
Contractions.
She's going into labour.
What, the birds and the bees? She's having a baby. I needed to see the Flesh in its early days. That's why I scanned it. That's why we were there in the first place. I was going to drop you off for fish and chips first, but things happened and there was stuff and shenanigans. Beautiful word, shenanigans.
Breathe. I needed enough information to block the signal to the Flesh.
The signal to you.
Stand away from her, Rory.
Given what we've learned, I'll be as humane as I can, but I need to do this and you need to stand away!
Don't be. Hold on. We're coming for you. I swear it. Whatever happens, however hard, however far, we will find you.
No, you're not. You haven't been here for a long, long time.

What?
Oh, no. No more trouble there, thank goodness. I can now take the Tardis wherever and whenever I like. I've got absolute control over her.
Yes, exactly.
What, this?
Well, this is the space time coordinate programmer. The wretched thing's nearly worn out. That's the trouble with the Tardis. She's getting on a bit, you know, Jo.
Look, must you?
There's precious little protein in an apple, you know.
Protein's the thing for breakfast, Jo.
Yes, that's where we're going to next.
Metebelis Three. The Tardis can't miss this time. I've actually wired the coordinates into the programmer.
I can't wait to go there, you know, Jo.
It must be a fascinating place. Just imagine it, a blue sun.
No, not a green light, it's a blue light. Everything's blue there.
Mmm, absolutely.
You know, I might even get a hold of one of those famous blue sapphires. Well, there you are. That should do it, I think.
Where are you off to?
Oh, good. Give me a couple of minutes and we'll be off.
Well, Metebelis Three, of course.
Why? Where are you thinking of going to?
Oh, Jo.
never listen to a word I say!
No, no, no!
Lethbridge Stewart, I'm not a policeman. Neither are you, for that matter.
Then do your duty, Brigadier.
Ah, Jo, all ready?
A very pretty mixed metaphor.
I'm going to Metebelis Three.
I wouldn't advise you to try.
Metebelis Three, Jo? Where else would you like to go? You choose for yourself.
Jo, you've got all the time in the world, and all the space. I'm offering them to you.
I don't know whether to feel flattered or insulted. It's all right, Jo, I understand.
Jo?
Tell the Brigadier that I'll follow him down.
Later.
Goodbye.
So the fledgling flies the coop.
Hello? I'll speak to anyone.
Yes, you're quite right, Brigadier. Nobody must go down that mine until I've had a chance to do just that.
We must stop them!
Who's in the cage?
Well, stop winding!
Stop winding, I said!
Quickly, man, quickly!
What?
What? There's only one thing to do!
Right, reverse the motor!
Don't argue, man. Do as I say. Brigadier, help me!
Yes.
How deep are they?
How deep's the shaft?
Well, can you rig a donkey engine and a pulley system? If we can free the other cage, we could use that.
We'll just have to risk that. Mind you, it'd mean cutting the cable.
Oh, where?
Well, that's where you're wrong.
Do you recognise that?
Yes, precisely. I found it on the floor. It had been removed from the brake linkage. This was no accident, Mister Davies. This was deliberate sabotage.
What about the west seam here. Can we reach them through there?
That's ridiculous!
Is it, indeed? I hadn't realised. I've been wanting to meet you for a long time. Your paper on DNA synthesis was quite remarkable for your age.
No, no, no, I mean for the age that you live in. Now, you were about to make a suggestion, I believe, Professor?
You know, Global Chemicals is beginning to interest me. Tell me, Professor, do you know the layout?
I'm quite spry for my age, actually.
Hai!
Venusian akido, gentlemen. I do hope I haven't hurt you.
I'm afraid you have me under several disadvantages, sir. Whom am I addressing?
Yes, and very efficient it is too, if I may say so.
It's really quite simple. I'm attached to UNIT as a scientific advisor.
We urgently need cutting equipment at the mine. You have refused to give it. Now my information is that it is stored in that shed over there.
Hmm.
The breaking strength at this point should be something in the region of a hundred and twenty three point thirty six pounds.
Well, you're back quickly, Brigadier.
Thank you, yes.
Indeed there isn't, Brigadier. Jo and the others need my help now. So, if Mister Davies and some of his colleagues would come with me?
Don't touch him.
He's dead. Come on, we'll find the others.
Jo?
Jo? Where are you?
(reads) Couldn't wait any longer. Gone to find another way out. Jo. The idiots. Why didn't they wait?
Yes, of course. That's the west seam. Come on. Let's go after them.
Jo?
Jo, can you hear me?
What's that light?
Up ahead, there.
The light's green.
Come on. What an extraordinary smell. Come on.
What is this stuff? No, don't touch it. Come on, let's get on.
Where?
Dave, look at his hand!
Where's the girl?
Take him up to the surface, quickly as you can. Let the professor take a look at him.
I'm going on ahead to look for Jo. Tell the Brigadier that I'll find her and bring her back, but don't let anybody come down looking after us. You understand?
It's far too dangerous.
Jo? Jo, are you there?
What is it?
Good grief! Come on!
Nil desperandum, Jo.
We mustn't let them touch us, must we. Now, how do we get out of here?
Lift it up. Right now, push it over.
Get a hold of this pole. Take it over that side.
Make room for me.
Right, you ready?
Off we go. No, not that way. The rail's blocked. This way. Through the cave here.
Well, it's only about a foot deep.
Jo, we haven't got any alternative.
Then close your eyes.
Good girl. That's it. Right, now punt way.
Well, I've heard of boating lakes, but this is ridiculous. A bit more. Right, that'll do. Right, get rid of your pole.
Come on. That's it. Well done, Jo.
We go up this crevice. It was marked on the map.
Well, that stuff must have come down here from somewhere. If there's a way down, there's a way up. I think I know where it leads to. Come on, you go first.
If I remember rightly, it gets easier further up.
What is it?
I think I'm beginning to understand. Now, hold on a minute. I've got to get a hold of one of those.
Come on by.
Now don't knock the pit prop over. You'll have the whole thing down on us.
Keep tight into the wall.
All right?
Good. Go on.
Right, let me pass.
A pipe. I was right.
After you, Miss Grant.
Up you go.
Oh, it's crude oil. Or rather crude oil waste. You can see it on the sides of the pipe.
Where else. Come on, up you go.
Yes, I certainly can.
It means I think we ought to hurry. Come on!
Well, they must be in some way. And that waste area down the mine seems to be their breeding ground.
Where? To tell Stevens about us?
Oh, and which side are you on, Mister Elgin?
Good man.
Good heavens, what am I thinking of. Mister Elgin, can you get us out of here without us being seen?
And what about Fell?
Fell?
Well, the moral of story, of course, is never trust a Venusian shanghorn with a perigosto stick.
Thanks very much. It's really excellent this wine, though I don't recognise the vintage.
Can I have a bottle to take home?
Brigadier, do you want a little more wine?
Excuse me, will you?
Thanks.
Bad news. The other miner's dead.
Yes, I'm afraid so. He never regained consciousness.
Well, they've completed the post mortem on Hughes.
Every cell in his body had been attacked. By some sort of virus, apparently. They still haven't been able to isolate it though.
No, not quite. We've still got that egg, remember?
Yes, isn't it? Well, tomorrow morning, Professor Jones and I are going to examine it properly.
Well quite frankly, Brigadier, I fail to see the value of a lot of idiot soldiers clumping about the place.
Lethbridge Stewart.
I think a good night's sleep is indicated, Jo.
Yes well, I shouldn't be too late if I were you. Goodnight.
By the way, Jo, the Tardis did come up trumps. I got to Metebelis Three, as you can see.
Goodnight.
Professor Jones, the very man. I've had some thoughts about this so-called virus.
It seems me that if we were to postulate an active nucleus
The egg. It must have hatched out.
Nancy, now be careful. Find out where it's gone and come back here at once.
Well, the others did.
Yes, and the Brigadier.
Yes?
Thank you, Nancy. It can't be helped. Well, at least we can analyse this slime.
Well?
Well, it's quite simple, Jo. We're putting some of the green cells from the maggot's trail with some human body cells.
Oh, Jo, really!
Rather as a virus does.
Correct, Jo, correct.
Well, we'll just have to get a hold of one of those maggots, won't we?
Well, I don't like the idea any more than you do, Jo, but we've no alternative.
What?
Orders? Whose orders? Not that fellow from Global Chemicals?
Wait, wait, Brigadier. Give me an hour.
Give me half an hour.
At least give me a chance to talk to the wretched man.
Right.
Mister Stevens, at the moment those maggots and their eggs are situated in one place where we can observe them. Now if you seal off that mine, then we shall have no way of knowing
Oh, then you don't intend to blow up the mine?
All I'm asking for is a little more time.
Time to find out the truth. Time to find out if the waste from your product is causing these maggots to appear.
You have no such right.
How do you do?
If he does that, it would be criminal folly.
Orders. Is nobody capable of acting on their own around here?
You must stop him!
You must!
The best? I think you'll find, Mister Yates, that this is the worst day's work the world has seen for many, many years.
No.
Yes?
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Then why did you blow up the mine.
Yes, well, I take your point, Brigadier. But, you know, there are times when I do wish that your devotion to duty was a trifle more flexible, shall we say.
Well, they're all over the place.
The maggots are some sort of larvae and not the finished product. Trying to find their way to daylight.
That's a very good question, Jo.
No, not a chance, Brigadier. Thick chitinous plates protecting the whole body surface. It's armour plated.
There's only one real answer. A biological counter-strike.
Professor Jones is working on it, but he needs more living tissue.
No, wait. I don't like it. Nobody should have to risk infection until we know we have a cure. We want no more deaths.
Can you get me any oil waste from Global Chemicals?
Good.
Let me talk to him.
Captain Yates, the Doctor here. Now look, I'm going to have a stab at getting in there myself.
I see. Well, er, keep a look out for me anyway, will you?
Yes. Yes, I know.
Oh the poor boyo is taken very sick. Something he ate, his mam said.
Me, oh, I'm his Da. I mean, they told me I was too old to take over, they did, but I've been doing this milk round, oh, fifty-three years, wet or fine, didn't I. Oh, there's life in the old dog yet. Ah, I was only saying to Rosie up at the Red Dragon. A big fine strapping girl she is
Thank you.
(woman) You say one word.
(woman) Do you? Well, watch out I don't slosh you with it!
Now, where can we talk?
Right, come on.
All right, Captain Yates, what have you found out?
Yes, yes, I know. That's obvious. But have you been able to get a hold of any of that waste?
Well can you get a hold of the formula?
Where's it kept?
Well done, Captain Yates. This could prove absolutely vital.
Oh? Who?
Oh, (welsh) Lovely.
Who are you? Where are you?
Why should I want to talk to a machine?
You're still a machine.
No.
Then yes. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. We are more than machines.
What are you then?
B, O, double S. The BOSS.
Ha!
You're still nothing but a gigantic adding machine like every other computer.
Stevens?
Yes, infuriating, isn't it.
Today Llanfairfach, tomorrow the world, eh?
A machine. A megalomaniac machine, but still a machine!
And that is?
What's that?
Bombing? What bombing?
The fool. What did he want to bring them in for? Doesn't he realise that bombing'll never stop those maggots?
Well, it won't work, I tell you.
Really? Then try this one. If I were to tell you that the next thing I say will be true, but that the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?
Check!
Go on.
Check and mate! You're nothing but a machine after all.
Oh, I'm not. No, I'm merely working out a few sums to keep myself from getting bored. Now, let's see. Pi. Three point one four one six
Therapy? Oh, what a pretty euphemism. You're not trying to tell me this is all for my own good?
And that it hurts you more than it hurts me?
You didn't mean it to though, did you.
Nonsense. Sometimes it helps, you know.
Don't worry, my dear fellow. I'm having a whale of a time.
Global Chemicals taking all the profits.
Such as a little touch of brainwashing?
Freedom from freedom.
Now, wait. BOSS! BOSS! Now you're being illogical. If you destroy me, you'll destroy your bargaining power. After all, I'd make a good hostage, wouldn't I?
Pleasure? Well, well, well. Perhaps I was wrong about you after all. That last remark was worthy of a human being.
Captain Yates, my dear fellow. I'm terribly sorry.
Yates, get up. Get up! Don't mess around there. Come on, get up. There's no time for horseplay. How did you know I was here?
Well, we've got to get out fast. There's more going on here than I thought.
I don't. I mean all over the world. Come on, we've got to tell the Brigadier.
That'll be for us.
Hold it. They're coming.
No, I didn't expect it to.
I thought they were in the lab.
We've got to get them out of there. Jump in, Sergeant.
All right, Sergeant, call up Jo and ask if she can see us.
Yes, I heard that.
Yes, I can see it. Tell Jo to stand by.
No, wait, Sergeant, wait.
Right, off you go now.
Get him into the car, quick. You all right?
Any change, Jo?
I can't understand it. He should have come to by now.
What did he say?
Serendipity?
What is it?
Well, I've given him a broad spectrum antibiotic. That should slow the infection down. No, we must find an answer to those maggots before they pupate. Imagine, thousands of flying insects spreading their infection throughout the world.
Serendipity. What on Earth did he mean by serendipity?
Mike! You don't know how glad I am to see you. How did you get away?
But why?
Gently, Mike. Fight it.
No, it is not necessary. Your orders are false. Do you understand me? False!
Keep quiet, Brigadier, and keep still. Now, Mike, listen to me. It is necessary for me to show you something.
Yes. For increased efficiency. Now, I'm going to take something from my pocket. Now, it won't harm you. It won't harm you.
Watch it, Mike. Watch it carefully, Mike.
Strange stones, these Metebelis sapphires. Watch it. Look deep into the blue light. Soon your mind will be locked onto the crystalline pattern and the neural paths of your brain will be swept clean, and you will be free!
So you see, Brigadier? My trip to Metebelis Three wasn't wasted after all.
Oh, good grief! Wake up, Lethbridge Stewart. Wake up.
If he hadn't tried so hard, he's have come in shooting. I'd have been a dead man by now. You too, probably.
You're in the Nuthutch.
Professor Jones' house.
Yes, well, you'll be all right now, old chap.
I'm afraid he's not. I'm going to ask you to go back. Do you think you feel up to it?
I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this but there's some information that I simply must have. Now, here's what I want you to do.
What would be the point, Jo? You know what happened to the others. Ordinary treatment won't work.
He means a lot to you, doesn't he?
Well, then trust me, Jo. I'm sure these injections are doing him some good.
At least it'll give us time to find the real cure.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Well done, Brigadier. Now I can really get on.
Well, Nancy's gone to make some sandwiches, I believe.
Yes. Why, don't you like it?
Carrying on where Professor Jones left off. I'm trying to find a specific antibiotic reaction.
Yes, it could be. You know, I wish I knew what he meant by serendipity.
Yes, it means making a marvellous discovery by mistake. I have an idea Professor Jones was on the point of a breakthrough.
Yes. Yes, I have, but it doesn't say a thing. Take a look for yourself.
What have you got there, Sergeant?
It's a chrysalis. They're beginning to change.
Like the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly.
I wish I knew, Brigadier.
Yes.
Yes, it's horribly possible. Well, they're our number one priority now.
That'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
What is it, Nancy?
It's dead. It's not a husk like the other one but a complete dead maggot.
But don't you understand, Brigadier? What killed it?
Yes. This could be exactly what we need. How much of this fungus have you got?
Show me, quickly.
Thank you, Brigadier. Right, Benton.
All right, Sergeant, start scattering.
There's some down here, Sergeant.
Right alongside the car.
That's it.
Not quite, Brigadier. Remember that empty skin.
I haven't seen any more about, but you never know.
Sergeant Benton!
Well, that seems to be the last of them, Benton. Let's get back to the Brigadier.
Keep down, Sergeant!
Careful, Sergeant. What a beautiful creature.
And you say he was delirious?
Can you remember what he said?
Jo, think hard. You were with him in the lab. Did he seem on the track of a cure?
Oh, it's very curious. Well, I shall just have to hope for some serendipity of my own.
A happy accident.
Jo, that's it! Do you happen to remember which powder?
Then come and show me, quickly. Come on!
And you're positive this is the one?
Well, I should have guessed. It's the same fungus that killed that maggot.
It must be!
So, what's the computer going to do?
Right. Well, I'll get up there as soon as I finish this.
Making an aqueous extract of the amino fraction of this fungus.
That's right.
Thank you, Nancy. Jo, make up the paste from that fungus powder and apply it to the green stain on Cliff's neck.
All right, Captain Yates, where's the Brigadier?
Well, thank goodness for that. I shall go in alone.
Brigadier, if I'm not out of there by three minutes to four, you and the rest of your clod-hopping friends can come in
No, I'm afraid not. If I'm not out by then, I shall be dead. No, you must go in and try and destroy that computer. Right, now lets synchronise our watches.
Now look here, my dear fellow
Right, come on, get it up!
Stevens! Stevens, listen to me, I've got to talk to you. You've got to stop this.
Of course you still exist. Don't listen to this, this machine. Fight it!
Stevens, listen to me. You've seen where this efficiency of yours leads. Wholesale pollution of the countryside. Devilish creatures spawned by the filthy by-products of your technology. Men walking around like brainless vegetables. Death. Disease. Destruction.
In the usual efficient way, I suppose. Elimination.
Stevens, I want you to look at this crystal. Look at this sapphire. Look deep into its blue light.
Don't listen to this machine. You're the one in control. Fight it! Look at this crystal. Look at it. Look deep into the blue light. Look at it. Look at it!
Look at it. Look at it, Stevens. Look deep into the blue light. Look at it.
That's it, fight it. Fight it! You're a human being!
Come with me.
Get down everyone! Take cover!
Come on! Come on!
Including the Brigadier?
Well, Jo, we'd better get back to UNIT HQ. We've got a report to make out.
Oh? Are you thinking of staying here?
Where?
And you want to go?
I see. When?
Er, look, will you excuse me? I do think I'm going to be wanted on the telephone.
You got onto your uncle at United Nations, didn't you?
Yes, and look where the first time got you.
Mind? He might even be able to turn you into a scientist.
Yes.
Save me a piece of wedding cake.
Oh, I nearly forgot. Your wedding present.

No, no, Mel.
That was a nice nap. Now, down to business.
I'm a bit worried about the temporal flicker in sector thirteen. There's a bicentennial refit of the Tardis to book in. I must just pop over to Centauri Seven and then perhaps a quick holiday. Right, that all seems quite clear. Just three small points. Where am I? Who am I? And who are you? The Rani! Stay back!
Why should you care? Since you were exiled from Gallifrey, you've had nothing but contempt for all other Time Lords.
And what do you want with me? And where's Mel?
You're up to something. Perhaps I'll find the answer on this.
You're trying to deflect me, so the answer is on here. Quarks. One up, one down. One strange matter? That asteroid is composed of strange matter. What monstrous experiment are you dabbling in now?
Ethics? Don't be such a hypocrite. Your past is littered with the mutilated results of your unethical experiments.
Stay away. Whatever you've brought me here for, I'm having no part of it.
Stay away or I'll smash this!
I'll smash it to pieces!
Where am I? Who are you?
All right? Am I? Of course. And you?
Why not indeed. We both are.
A bull in a barber shop. A navigational guidance system distorter. This would force any passing spaceship into landing here. Where are we, by the way?
Of course. Fit as a trombone.
Hmm?
Are you? Nerves, I expect. Now, let's see. What were we up to, er, Mel, did you say your name was?
Red hair. I recall red hair.
Argh! Who's that?
No, standing next to you.
Me? No wonder I've lost my memory.
Experiment?
The explosion must have caused me to regenerate.
I want all mirrors removed from the Tardis henceforth.
Oh yes, the Tardis. And you. Mel. There's something not quite in sync. I must be suffering from post-regeneration amnesia.
Important? Did I? I wonder what I was up to.
No, seems pretty far gone. Need a genius to unravel it.
Oh yes, I definitely remember that.
How did you know that, Mel?
University? You remind me of someone I used to know when I was there.
Your confidence in me is very flattering, Mel.
Come on, come on.
Why I chose you as an assistant, I'll never know. Perhaps I will when I've regained my memory.
Well, look at me. Can't you see? Mop my brow!
What'd you do that for?
A bad workman always blames his fools.
Do I detect a hint of bad temper, Mel? Why are you behaving so uppity? Could it be that you think yourself superior to me?
Quite. Though at the moment I feel far from superior. This is all a mystery to me.
Oh, yes, yes. Must you state the obvious? I know that its functions diffuse the impulses from there with this goo. But what's it for? I'm beginning to think this set-up's got nothing to do with me.
Omnipotence. The mind behind this bag of tricks operates on a grand scale.
What's in there?
Are you as clueless as you appear, Mel?
Wouldn't I?
That's it, then. I'm doing nothing until my memory returns. Nothing until I know what I'm about.
No, I will not work in the dark like this.
I'm adamant. This could be some diabolical scheme.
That's the question.
Hmm? What is it?
Oh, you drink it. I don't want it. Don't try to humour me. Leave me alone.
How do you know what I'm like? I've regenerated. I mean, look at me. Look at me.
Perhaps this is my new persona. Sulky, bad-tempered. I mean, think how I spoke to you earlier.
Even so, that's probably how I am now. You don't understand regeneration, Mel. It's a lottery, and I've drawn the short plank. Anyway, I need a radiation wave meter and, brilliant as I am, even I can't improvise that.
The Tardis? Do you know where it is?
Oh, good. I fancy a breath of fresh air. We'll both go.
Are you coming, Mel?
Rather unusual species. Can't say I recognise it. Humanoid with reptilian influences, wouldn't you say, Mel?
Really? I suppose we've explored this planet. I wish I could remember.
Rather a harsh judgment, Mel.
The more I know me, the less I like me.
No, I think not. Lacks my natural humility.
Doesn't look right without a horse. I need something more dignified, Timelord-ish.
A little portentous, perhaps, Mel?
Old hat?
Not frilled. (Peter Davison's cricketing gear, with bat and pads.)
How's that? Would that bowl a maiden over?
Ah, thank goodness in this regeneration I've regained my impeccable sense of haute couture.
I was hallucinating. I had an overwhelming sense of evil. And there was a word. Ra, Ra, Ran, Rad
Oh yes. Where do you reckon I'd keep it?
Won't be a jiffy. Absence makes the nose grow longer. (The Doctor leaves.)
Rani, that's the name, the evil name.
Er, well, yes, it must be. Yes.
Completely.
Destroyed? Let's not be hasty.
You know, I can't help feeling sorry for the Rani, Mel, getting caught in her own devious trap.
I suppose so, but what was she doing prowling around on Lakertya?
Is it?
Have to be a cosmic breakthrough for a neurochemist of her stature to come storming the barricades.
What scientific knowledge? What am I doing? If only I could remember.
The machine won't tell me what's behind that locked door, will it? The machine won't restore my memory, will it? If the Rani was after our experiment, we must be playing with fire.
Is she? Oh, don't underestimate her. She's a brilliant but sterile mind. There's not one spark of decency in her.
You are?
It's my forte.
And another thing. Why was the Rani dressed like you, Mel?
No. She was in disguise. Practising another one of her talents.
Afraid so. More hasta less vista.
I cannot understand how I could have made such a fundamental mistake.
The heat radiation from the catalyst was of high frequency.
So elementary. I broke the second law of thermodynamics.
You should know the answer to that, Mel. Didn't C P Snow expound on thermodynamics?
Well, you said you admired all his writings, read all his books.
You, Mel, forget? A kangaroo never forgets.
Oh, yes. Memory like an elephant. A running gag applied to you, I feel sure, Mel.
Oh here, see for yourself.
What?
Did you? Mel, there's something caged in there.
Eh?
Oh, yes. PHB. It's biodegradable. We don't want to litter up Lakertya with non-destructible waste like they're doing on your planet, Mel.
Sugar and starch. We can ferment our own.
PES? No, not so good. It's a petroleum based plastic.
Mmm.
Where?
But I thought you said the Lakertyans weren't very advanced.
Yes.
When we discovered that sad skeleton.
You! Where's Mel?
What have you done with her?
He's here!
It's me, you washer woman! Me!
Drop the melodramatics. Your pathetic impersonation doesn't fool me at all. Incidentally, that wig's not you.
I knew you weren't finished, Rani. I told Mel as much.
No, Mel!
Try looking in the mirror at the face of evil.
All right, compromise. Let me feel your pulse.
Ah, the proof of the pumpkin's in the squeezing.
Let me feel your pulse. Pulses, I should say. Two of them. One for each heart.
Yes, perhaps I am, because if you're the Rani, I'm dicing with destruction.
Mel? The worst she'll do is give me carrot juice. Carrot juice? What made me think of that?
Favourite? I hate it.
Ah, caught you out, haven't I.
I've regenerated, and I'm suffering from post-regenerative amnesia, as far as I can remember. Fair exchange is no mockery. You feel my pulses, I'll feel yours. I'll lean across here with my arm behind my back, if you want proof I'm a Time Lord. Come on.
That's what I've been trying to tell you. Now yours.
Mel?
Yes. And I've become more of a fool too, it seems, Mel. Doesn't bode well for my seventh persona, being so completely taken in by the wretched Rani.
But what does she want with me?
Strange matter.
You should have, Mel. A Princeton physicist discovered it in your Earth year 1984.
It's an incredibly dense form of matter. A lump the size of this would weigh more than your planet Earth.
An astute question. If that asteroid exploded, it would send off a blast of gamma rays equivalent to a supernova.
And everything else in this corner of the galaxy. When the Rani dabbles, she dabbles on a grand scale.
Here, go and listen.
Yes. But why, Mel, why? What is she up to? It starts here.
And leave the Lakertyans to the machinations
Of the Rani? Impossible! Given time I'll work out the combination.
Did you hear a voice, or am I hallucinating?
Who'd have thought she'd have been so obvious. Huh. That's my age. And the Rani's.
Geniuses, every one of them. The Rani's collected together the most creative minds and the most powerful matter in the universe.
The scope of her imagination is breathtaking.
Not admiration, fascination. And sadness. If only the Rani could have redirected her incredible talents for good.
What is it I can contribute these other geniuses can't?
With a unique conceptual understanding of the properties of time.
Do you know what's behind that door?
Pity. Beyus, why have you assisted?
Take Mel.
Go, Mel. Go.
Ah yes, yes. Let me see. Polyethersulphone. Excellent. How clever you are, Mel. Where did you find it?
On, is it? Oh, yes. I was trying to jog my memory. No luck though. Hold the other end, Mel.
You're not concentrating, Mel. Hold it steady. We've got to manoeuvre it into position.
Yes, well, where there's a will, there's a Tom, Dick and a Harriet.
Oh. no, no, no. There's some information I simply must have before I make the final delicate adjustments.
Ideally, what's behind that door?
The identity of this rather interesting substance.
Crucial.
No, stop!
I say, I mean, we may not see eye to eye. Try and see it my way. I'm trying not to be personal. I mean, after all, a bat may look at a Time Lord.
I can't say I share the Rani's taste in pets.
This is what I'll never forget. Unique talents every one of them. The Rani's roamed the universe plucking these geniuses out of time, at the height of their powers and reducing them to the status of laboratory specimens.
Time, the concept of time. I'm sure that's at the heart of what she's up to. Otherwise why reserve a place for me, a Time Lord, in this abysmal parade.
Which you will help her put me in.
You know, Beyus, your collaboration with the Rani's difficult to understand.
Nothing outside compared to this.
It's composed of strange matter, Beyus. A devastating force. With the right trigger, that harmless asteroid, as you call it, could incinerate your planet and anything else in this corner of the galaxy. And what does the Rani keep behind there? Oh, all good things come to a bend.
Microthermistor. I doubt if she'll have a spare.
I had no intention of hurting you.
Here's a turn up for the cook. A rock that talks.
Don't hold that against me.
That bad?
Hello. Haven't I seen you hanging around somewhere?
No restrictions for movement. The Lakertyans can come and go freely, then.
Not a favourite haunt of yours, I take it, Ikona.
He said I'd find the answer to his subservience here.
Why not?
He was too anxious for explanations. But whatever the threat, it must be considerable. Do you see anything that's different? New?
Hmm, I wonder. Couldn't we ask someone, you know, if
There's none so deaf as those that clutch at straws.
Hmm, killer insects.
Let Mel come towards me. I've kept my side of the bargain. You've got what you want.
What's he crowing on about, Mel?
A hologram! As substantial as the Rani's scruples.
Oh, the Rani would never go to those extremes. She never does anything without reason.
A bird in the hand keeps the Doctor away.
Only on this occasion, it'll have the opposite affect.
Hmm, a space rocket launcher, sure enough. But have you noticed it's got a fixed trajectory?
Maybe as a side effect, Ikona, but not the intention. I'd say the target is the asteroid of strange matter, which means the launch is locked into a precise time.
Assuming it is, the Rani's overriding priority will be to meet that countdown. No more setbacks or delays. I must go back to the laboratory. That sealed chamber, I've got to get in there. Out of the frying pan into the mire. Right, Ikona, start the diversionary tactics.
Really, this is not the place for double entendres.
A fool and his formula are soon parted.
Gentlemen, such hostility. Remember, blessed are the pie makers for they shall make light pastry.
You wouldn't say that if you met my uncle.
Ah well, every dogma has its day.
Exactly. The faster a fat man runs, the fatter he will get.
Quick, Mel, don't just stand there, help me!
No, Mel. Two wrongs don't make a left turn. Right.
Leave the quotes to the expert, Mel.
The rocket! It's a fixed trajectory.
So, the target is the asteroid, which at any moment now will reach the solstice and I'm sure that's the deadline. He who dares spins.
Whoops. A supernova.
Do you realise how close the Rani must have taken her Tardis in order to record that?
Not by my reckoning. The only known detonator for exploding a strange matter asteroid is strange matter itself.
A lump the size of this brain would weigh as much as an entire planet.
For a lightweight substitute. Could be, could be.
Not completely. What I can't fathom is why the Rani took such an incredible risk to record a supernova.
No, more than that. She wouldn't be simply interested in a display of pyrotechnics. Too negative. No, there's a deeper motive and the answer's in here.
A knowledge of time. Oh, a great discovery. I worked that out ages ago.
Not the complete story. The last chapter's missing. Keeping quiet, isn't it?
Possibly. On the other hand it could be wondering why you want helium two. That's why you want to explode strange matter, isn't it? To reproduce helium two.
Indeed you don't. (to Mel) Discrete particles of time.
A time manipulator. You're going to change this planet into a time manipulator.
I don't believe it. A time manip. This monstrosity will give you the ability to change the order of creation.
That means Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Louis Pasteur, Elvis, even Mrs Malaprop will never have existed.
Thrust into the oblivion.
The same with Lakertya. All life on this planet will become extinct.
All living creatures left behind exterminated.
While you float off safely in your Tardis.
Before I thought you were a psychopath without murderous intent. I withdraw the qualification.
Thirty nine.
Stay back!
As you snore, so shall you sleep.
Waste net, want net.
And so you shall. You have a big part to play, Ikona. You must stir up the Lakertyans into fighting back. Come, quickly.
The Doctor must be apprehended, mistress.
Hmm.
You've got to give the Rani full marks for ingenuity.
Less of the pessimism, Mel. Not all the cards are in the Rani's flavour.
Now, if we were to run a wire from here round to here, then the circuit wouldn't be broken when the bangle was open. Mel. You're the computer expert. How about it?
Beneficiary. Good thinking, Ikona.
Well done, Mel. Ikona, I'm relying on you to help the Lakertyans help themselves for once. Remove the bangles.
She's not the only one with a sting in her tail.
Sting. A double bluff. A speciality of mine.
When that voice reaches zero, there'll be nobody left on Lakertya to listen to me or anyone else.
First see if there's anyone in there. Mel, all hands to the stumps.
Ikona, take good care of him.
They all are. Louis Pasteur. He will rid his world of a major scourge. He will save the lives of tens of millions.
Whoops. Oh. Take them back to the Tardis.
Thank you, Ikona.
Don't leave it too late, Beyus.
Rani! It's over. You're beaten! I've aborted the launch and the Lakertyans are preparing to attack.
The delay in lift off means the rocket will miss the asteroid.
Absolutely. A miss is as good as a smile.
This way, ladies, gentlemen, others. I'll get you back to where you belong. Hopefully.
I'll explain how it works later. It's all relative.
Mel.
Goodbye, Faroon. When I think of Beyus I shall remember with admiration the sacrifice he made.
What's that?
Memory like a dromedary.
An antidote against those killer insects in the globe. The Rani always takes out an insurance policy.
Well, time and tide melts the snowman.
Who's waiting? I'm ready.
I'll grow on you, Mel. I'll grow on you.

So, it's two hundred thousand, and it's a spaceship. No, wait a minute, space station, and er, go and try that gate over there. Off you go.
Two hundred thousand.
The Fourth great and bountiful Human Empire. And there it is, planet Earth at it's height. Covered with mega-cities, five moons, population ninety six billion. The hub of a galactic domain stretching across a million planets, a million species, with mankind right in the middle.
He's your boyfriend.
Come on, Adam. Open your mind. You're going to like this. Fantastic period of history. The human race at its most intelligent. Culture, art, politics. This era has got fine food, good manners.
My watch must be wrong. No, it's fine. It's weird.
My history's perfect.
Good question. Actually, that is a good question. Adam, me old mate, you must be starving.
No, you just need a bit of grub. Oi, mate - how much is a kronkburger?
Money. We need money. Let's use a cashpoint.
There you go, pocket money. Don't spend it all on sweets.
Go and find out. Stop nagging me. The thing is, Adam, time travel's like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guide book, you've got to throw yourself in. Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers. Or is that just me? Stop asking questions, go and do it. Off you go, then. Your first date.
Er, this is going to sound daft, but can you tell me where I am?
Floor one three nine of what?
What's Satellite Five.
Look at me. I'm stupid.
You've got me. Well done. You're too clever for me.
Why, what happens on Floor five hundred?
I get it. You broadcast the news.
Oi! Mutt and Jeff! Over here!
Right from scratch, thanks.
Compressed information, streaming into her. Reports from every city, every country, every planet, and they all get packaged inside her head. She becomes part of the software. Her brain is the computer.
Nah, she wouldn't remember any of it. There's too much. Her head'd blow up. The brain's the processor. As soon as it closes, she forgets.
They've all got tiny little chips in their head, connecting them to her and they transmit six hundred channels. Every single fact in the Empire beams out of this place. Now that's what I call power.
This technology's wrong.
Oh, yeah.
The walls are made of gold.
I didn't do anything.
All right. I'll hug anyone.
You're talking like you'll never see her again. She's only going upstairs.
Have you ever been up there?
But you've never been to another floor? Not even one floor down?
At last. She's clever.
Don't you even ask?
You're a journalist. Why's all the crew human?
There's no aliens on board. Why?
Then where are they?
What threats?
Adding up to one great big fact, and you didn't even notice.
I can see better. This society's the wrong shape, even the technology.
It's backwards. There's a great big door in your head. You should've chucked this out years ago.
It's not just this space station, it's the whole attitude. It's the way people think. The great and bountiful Human Empire's stunted. Something's holding it back.
Trust me, humanity's been set back about ninety years. When did Satellite Five start broadcasting?
Rose, tell her to button it.
Go on, then. See you!
Something to do with the turbine.
Exactly. I give up on you, Cathica. Now, Rose. Look at Rose. Rose is asking the right kind of question.
Why is it so hot?
Well, never underestimate plumbing. Plumbing's very important.
Here we go. Satellite Five, pipes and plumbing. Look at the layout.
But there's something wrong.
All the way from the top.
Something up there is generating tons and tons of heat.
Keys are just codes, and I've got the codes right here. Here we go. Override two one five point nine.
Someone up there likes me.
Bye!
That's her gone. Adam's given up. Looks like it's just you and me.
Good.
The walls are not made of gold. You should go back downstairs.
I think she's dead.
They've all got chips in their head, and the chips keep going, like puppets.
It doesn't matter, because we're off. Nice to meet you. Come on.
Since that information's keeping us alive, I'm hardly going to say, am I.
And who's that?
You mean that thing's in charge of Satellite Five?
Yes.
Yes.
Let me out of these manacles. You'll find out how much fun I am.
Jagrafess.
No wonder, a creature that size. What's his life span?
That's one hell of a metabolism generating all that heat. That's why Satellite Five's so hot. You pump it out of the creature, channel it downstairs. Jagrafess stays cool, it stays alive. Satellite Five is one great big life support system.
Leave her alone. I'm the Doctor, she's Rose Tyler. We're nothing, we're just wandering.
I just said!
What?
You don't know what you're talking about.
Someone's been telling you lies.
What the hell's he done? What the hell's he gone and done? They're reading his mind. He's telling them everything.
Well, you'll never get your hands on it. I'll die first.
You and your boyfriends!
And no one's going to stop you because you've bred a human race that doesn't bother to ask questions. Stupid little slaves, believing every lie. They'll just trot right into the slaughter house if they're told it's made of gold.
And she's thinking. She's using what she knows.
Everything I told her about Satellite Five. The pipes, the filters, she's reversing it. Look at that.
It's getting hot.
She's venting the heat up here. The Jagrafess needs to stay cool and now it's sitting on top of a volcano.
Flick the switch! Oi, mate, want to bank on a certainty? Massive heat in a massive body, massive bang. See you in the headlines!
We're just going to go. I hate tidying up. Too many questions. You'll manage.
Oh, they might start believing a lot of things now. The human race should accelerate. All back to normal.
He's not my friend.
Is there something else you want to tell me?
The archive of Satellite Five. One second of that message could've changed the world.
That's it, then. See you.
As in goodbye.
What, like this?
Don't do what?
The whole of history could have changed because of you.
You were helping yourself.
Yes I can. 'Cause if you show that head to anyone, they'll dissect you in seconds. You'll have to live a very quiet life. Keep out of trouble. Be average, unseen. Good luck.
I only take the best. I've got Rose.

I don't know. I'll find her. I brought you here, I'll get you both out, you and your daughter. Jackie, look at me. Look at me. I promise you. I give you my word.
They're not taking instructions. Don't you understand? You're on every street, you're in their homes, you've got their children! Of course they're going to fight.
(sotto) Phone.
(sotto) Phone!
She's answered. She's alive. Why haven't they killed her?
They must need her for something.
The Genesis Ark?
Lost her.
I demand you leave that woman alone! I won't help you if you hurt her. Jackie, don't fight. I'll think of something.
Of what?
Yeah, I am. Mind you, I quite like hope. Hope's a good emotion. And here it comes.
Jake?
You can't just, just, just hop from one world to another. You can't.
But that's impossible. You can't have this sort of technology.
No!
I've got to get back. Rose is in danger, and her mother.
Right, yes, fine, hooray. But I've got to get back, right now.
When was this?
It's taken them three years to cross the void, but we can pop to and fro in a second. Must be the sheer mass of five million Cybermen crossing all at once.
Oh, where is the Mickey boy?
She's your daughter. You do know that? Did Mickey explain?
Who's the President now?
Oof. I'd keep an eye on her.
No.
I've been trying to tell you. Travel between parallel worlds is impossible. Then the Daleks break down the walls with a Sphere.
Then the Cybermen travelled across, then you lot. Those discs. Every time you jump from one reality to another, you rip a hole in the universe. This planet is starting to boil. Keep going and both worlds will fall into the Void.
Leaving five million Cybermen stranded on my Earth.
Hmm. Pete Tyler. I knew you when you were dead. Now here you are, fighting the fight alone. There is a chance, back on my world, Jackie Tyler might still be alive.
Her husband died. Good match.
What, close the breach? Stop the Cybermen? Defeat the Daleks? Do you believe I can do that?
Maybe that's all I need. Off we go, then!
First of all, I need to make a phone call. You don't mind?
Jackie, you're alive. Listen.
Shush. Listen, tell me. Where are you?
Yeah, which one? Is there any sort of sign? Anything to identify it?
Yeah, that helps
North corner, staircase three. Just keep low, we're trying our best.
I've got to go. I'm sorry.
Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Tyler.
I was at the wedding. You got her name wrong. Now then, Jakey boy, if I can open up the bonding chamber on this thing, it'll work on polycarbite.
Skin of a Dalek.
Sorry. No white flag. I only had a sheet of A4. Same difference.
I surrender unto you. A very good idea.
Oh now, hold on, wait a minute.
That's me. Always.
Not me. Never. How are you?
Good. And Mickity McMickey. Nice to see you!
By fighting. On the front line. I was there at the fall of Arcadia. Someday I might even come to terms with that. But you lot ran away!
The last four Daleks in existence. So what's so special about you?
So that's it! At last. The Cult of Skaro. I thought you were just a legend.
A secret order above and beyond the Emperor himself. Their job was to imagine, think as the enemy thinks. Even dared to have names. All to find new ways of killing.
I don't know. Never seen it before.
Both sides had secrets. What is it? What have you done?
What does that mean? What sort of Time Lord science? What do you mean?
Technology using the one thing a Dalek can't do. Touch. Sealed inside your casing. Not feeling anything ever, from birth to death, locked inside a cold metal cage. Completely alone. That explains your voice. No wonder you scream.
The Doctor will not.
Well, you got me there. Although there is always this.
That's screwdriver.
Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word. That's why I like it. Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do. It is very good at opening doors.
Rose, get out!
Jake, check the stairwell. The rest of you, come on.
Mickey, without us, they'd have opened it by force. To do that, they'd have blown up the sun. You've done us a favour. Now, run!
It's Pete from a different universe. There are parallel worlds, Jackie. Every single decision we make creates a parallel existence, a different dimension where
Time Lord science. What Time Lord science? What is it?
We've got to see what it's doing. We've got to go back up. Come on! All of you. top floor!
Time Lord science. It's bigger on the inside.
It's a prison ship.
Millions.
Oh, I'm ready. I've got the equipment right here. Thank you, Torchwood.
Slam it down and close off both universes.
They're part of the problem, and that makes them part of the solution. Oh yes! Well? Isn't anyone going to ask what is it with the glasses?
I can see, that's what. because we've got two separate worlds, but in between the two separate worlds, we've got the Void. That's where the Daleks were hiding. And the Cybermen travelled through the Void to get here. And you lot, one world to another, via the Void. Oh, I like that. Via the Void. Look.
I've been through it. Do you see?
Void stuff.
That's it. Look at the others. And the only one who hasn't been through the Void, your mother. First time she's looked normal all in her life.
But the Daleks lived inside the Void. They're bristling with it. Cybermen, all of them. I just open the Void and reverse. The Void stuff gets sucked back inside.
Pulling them all in!
The dead space. Some people call it Hell.
That's why you've got to go.
Back to Pete's world. Hey, we should call it that. Pete's World. I'm opening the Void, but only on this side. You'll be safe on that side.
The breach itself is soaked in Void stuff. In the end it'll close itself. And that's it. Kaput.
That's why I got these. (Magnaclamps) I'll just have to hold on tight. I've been doing it all my life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Once the breach collapses, that's it. You will never be able to see her again. Your own mother!
Those coordinates over there, set them all at six. And hurry up.
How many floors down?
Hope and Glory, Mutt and Jeff, Shiver and Shake.
Oh, I'm Shake.
Press the red button.
When it starts, just hold on tight. Shouldn't be too bad for us but the Daleks and the Cybermen are steeped in Void stuff. Are you ready?
Let's do it!
The breach is open! Into the Void! Ha!
Rose, hold on! Hold on!
Rose.
Rose
Rose. Rose. Rose.
Rose.
Inside the Tardis.
There's one tiny little gap in the Universe left, just about to close, and it takes a lot of power to send this projection. I'm in orbit around a super nova. I'm burning up a sun just to say goodbye.
Hold on
I'm still just an image. No touch.
The whole thing would fracture. Two universes would collapse.
Where are we? Where did the gap come out?
Norway. Right.
Dalek?
About two minutes.
You've still got Mister Mickey, then?
You're not?
And what about you? Are you
Oh, good for you.
Rose Tyler, Defender of the Earth. You're dead, officially, back home. So many people died that day and you've gone missing. You're on a list of the dead. Here you are, living a life day after day. The one adventure I can never have.
You can't.
Oh, I've got the Tardis. Same old life, last of the Time Lords.
Quite right, too. And I suppose, if it's one last chance to say it, Rose Tyler
What?
What?
But
What?
What?

Jamie!
Excuse me!
I wonder if you can help us?
Oh, I see.
He means the police telephone box.
Yes, well, Tardis, that's another name for it.
That's right. Tardis is a is a Gaelic word. Jamie, hush.
Yes, I know. Well, anyway, it's our property and we've come to collect it.
Yes!
Let me see this, please.
Yes, so I see. J Smith. Doesn't really help us, does it?
Oh, no. I don't think we'd better do that. Jamie, I think we'd better talk to the police.
Thank you very much. You'll be hearing from us.
Perhaps. I think we'd better keep an eye on him.
Well, didn't you notice his overalls? They were much too small for him, and the top sheet of his clip board was different to all the others. And when we mentioned the police he became friendly
That's him. There he goes.
For hire.
Follow that car.
This is his car. He must be around here somewhere.
Well, have you tried the door?
It's the man in the overalls. It's all right, he's alive.
Ken? Ken who?
No good, he's out cold. See if we can find some water somewhere. Hello, this is something. This really is something.
But why pay him to help steal the Tardis and then knock him on the head?
That's what's been bothering me, Jamie, too.
It's between two and three hundred pounds. Yes, it is a lot, at least for what he had to do. Put on a pair of overalls and just hang around. Come to think of it, why hang around? He was obviously planted. Why not just go off in the lorry?
I don't know.
Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes, so these must belong to somebody else. That's a fair assumption.
It's all right. It's only a train.
Well, it's a train. There are carriages and they go on wheels, on rails, and they're drawn by a steam. Hey, come back!
There is this. (the matchbook) The Tricolour. It's a coffee bar, apparently. And that's not all.
Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to left. These have been torn out from left to right.
It means we've got to find a coffee bar called The Tricolour, and look for a man called Ken or Kenneth someone, who's left-handed.
But it's so little, Jamie. It's too little. He might only have been there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again.
Bruce?
If only we knew what he looked like, Jamie.
We've got to untangle this, you know.
Oh?
No, no. There's more to it than that. Why leave that man in the hangar to give us a clue?
There is no delivery firm of that name. Not in the London area, anyway. I checked in the phone book.
Maybe.
Yes. If only we knew who our enemies are.
No, something else. I can feel them, closing in all around us.
Because you're so much better at them than I am, Jamie. Now, what did you find out?
Oh, dear.
Jamie, I'm being stared at. Is there something wrong with me?
Is my hair in disarray?
Do I look strange or bizarre?
That's some comfort. Look out, he's coming over.
Not at all.
Yes, er, Mister Perry?
Oh. Oh, dear. What a pity.
At about 10. Oh, yes. We'll be there.
Right.
Edward Waterfield. Genuine Victoriana.
I wonder if Mister Kenneth has found us.
K. Perry, Esquire. Yes, I think we'll go and see Mister Edward Waterfield.
Shh!
Yes, I know.
The early bird catches the worm, Jamie. Now do be quiet, there's a good chap. And for heaven's sake, don't knock into anything.
Shh!
It's interesting. In fact, Jamie, it's quite remarkable.
Hmm, you've noticed that.
Yes, so it seems. Except
Except that all these things are not reproductions. They're all genuine.
Here, look at this. To one deed box, four guineas. This is a bill from William Dearing and Son, 1866.
Yes. If you were going to make a forgery, wouldn't you try to dirty it up a bit? Yellow the edges, crinkle it up? This is brand new.
What?
Yes.
Well done.
But it's not very likely, is it? The only way to find out is to ask Waterfield.
I'm sure I heard somebody shouting. Jamie, we've got to get in there.
It's too pliable.
Boo!
You made the appointment.
Yes, well, we thought we'd be early. What are you doing here?
Yes, I think you've got some explaining to do, Mister Kenneth Perry.
So, it's Keith. Do you know a man called Bob Hall?
Well, he keeps some very rough company, including a man called Ken.
What? What do you know about Kennedy?
But it belongs to me.
Because, because of what's inside it and because it happens to be my property.
Well, is there another way through? This door is locked.
You're going to show me where this yard of yours is.
He's dead.
No, he's doing the right thing.
Yes, well, we'll have to find it before he comes back. Now I wonder what this telephone interference is.
Why make an appointment to see us at ten?
Yes, yes, the Tardis. Now, how did he die? His limbs are stiff, his hands clenched. Look, he died in horrible agony. Look at his face. Hello?
Yes. Now, he fell like that, with his arm stretched out. Jamie, go out into the hall and measure the length of it up to the door here.
It's only five from the door to the wall. There must be another room behind here.
Yes, you're right. Now, Waterfield will have the key. We'd better find something to prise it open with.
Well, look at this. That's where your telephone interference is coming from. Oh, yes, this is interesting.
Yes. Don't open that!
The master? Mister Waterfield?
Not very well, no. Ooh!
What's your name?
This works remarkably quickly, doesn't it?
No. No thank you, Mollie. But, you can tell me what the date is.
Yes, I'm feeling very much better, but I don't seem to be able to remember the date and where I am.
And this is Mister Edward Waterfield, I presume. You don't keep your appointments, do you?
Yes, indeed there were.
Yes. Well?
And just what do you think you're up to? You steal my property, you spirit Jamie and me a hundred years back in time and you murder a man along the way.
I don't believe you!
Power? Victims? What do you mean?
Who are they?
I will listen, I promise.
Is that your daughter?
Oh, yes, yes, very impressive. And now perhaps you'll explain what all this is about?
Patience? You don't seem to understand what's happened. A man has been murdered! You behave as though we're going on Sunday school outing.
Why have you brought us here? Who are these enemies of yours, these ones you say control you?
Inhuman?
Please do.
To try to find a way of exploring time?
Yes.
Static?
You mentioned static electricity.
Powers?
These creatures?
They knew about me, these creatures.
What are they called, these creatures?
Oh, yes. Perfectly.
Obey? Obey? What do you want?
What experiment?
What sort of test?
I will not be your slave!
Jamie?
Why do you ask about Jamie?
What do you mean? Tested how?
What have you done with your infernal meddling? What is this test? Do either of you know?
In the long run, yes.
Possibly.
Possibly.
And now they've got Jamie.
I have made up my mind.
Do you think I'm going to allow Jamie to run into danger without telling him anything? No, I will not.
We shall see.
He's still asleep. The gas in that box of yours was pretty potent.
Jamie.
So it seems. So who can have kidnapped him?
Everything you say, Waterfield, is true. If we cannot find Jamie, the Daleks will take pleasure in killing everyone in sight, and their greatest pleasure will be in killing me.
Straw.
A piece of straw.
DOCTOR enters.)
Oh, good day to you.
Yes, I know. I was listening. Let's have a look at that head of yours.
Come along.
I know what's happened to Victoria.
She's a prisoner of the Daleks.
Yes, of course I did!
Oh, fiddlesticks! Bosh! Jamie will cooperate. You may be certain of that.
Yes, perfectly sure. Jamie will do everything he is asked to do. Now come along, we must go and find Maxtible.
Then we're quits, aren't we?
Yes.
They want the human Factor, is that right?
Very complex. And you want to introduce this human factor into the race of Daleks?
Well why choose Jamie for this test?
But why him, why not me?
Why?
I see. What is this?
Skaro?
You want the human factor introduced. I see.
I will make up my own mind!
And if I agree, it means the creation of a race of super Daleks. My Tardis. I have no choice, do I. Very well, I agree.
I quite understand.
What must Jamie do?
It's all right, Mollie.
Never mind.
That'll do. Yes, Mollie, thank you very much. It's all right.
I wouldn't dream of telling him.
Thank you very much. Bye bye.
You'll have to brush up on your history. I can't be around to cover up for you all the time. Now then, in the Crimean War, the English, the French and the Turks fought the Russians.
Oh, I thought you'd be interested. I watched the Charge of the Light Brigade. Magnificent folly.
Oh, just looking around.
Jamie, you're in a temper!
What was that?
You were eavesdropping.
Now, you listen to me, Jamie!
Waterfield did not murder that man!
The Daleks forced him to!
Now, you listen to me.
Just a little argument.
Jamie seems to think that I'm lying to him.
He doesn't believe the Daleks are here.
Well, what can I do? Now, be fair, Jamie. Waterfield's tied hand and foot because of his daughter, and we're tied hand and foot because of the Tardis!
Now just where are you going?
No, not a bit. But one word of warning. Don't you try to be a one-man army. You leave well alone. I won't have you ruining everything trying to rescue Victoria Waterfield. Now, you understand?
Adding a little fuel to the fire. Tell Maxtible that I'll be along to his laboratory shortly.
Oh, yes, quite sure. Once our young friend has cooled his heels a bit, he'll launch off on his own. And you dropped the hint about the south wing beautifully.
Every single one of Jamie's reactions will be recorded on these Dalek machines.
Oh, yes. I quite understand.
I'm sure you will. And every step of Jamie's progress will be covered?
It took courage to fight Maxtible's Turkish wrestler.
But Jamie saved the Turk's life.
If he hadn't, he would have died in that room of yours. If you want the human factor, a part of it must include mercy.
Human beings have five senses. Sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. But there is instinct, too. Jamie used instinct to avoid your trap.
Suicidal attacks to gain an objective. Postulate. Self-preservation is a strong human factor. Jamie and his new friend are determined to succeed, but finding the girl is only part. Getting her away is another.
Are you sure you won't join me?
Oh, dear. Well, something else, perhaps?
I know. Let me ring for some food. Now, do join me?
Yes, I do, don't I?
Oh, how very unsociable.
Liba? Oh. No, thank you. I'm perfectly happy here, thank you. I'm perfectly happy.
What an extraordinary collection, isn't it?
Oh, I'm so sorry. You didn't, you weren't in the mood for talking, were you?
Yes, but I thought I'd have a little rest. I wanted to talk to you.
About you, Mister Terrall. You interest me. Do you know something? Ever since I came to this house, I, why, this is Circassian, surely.
Circassian. Ever since I came to this house, I have never seen you eat or drink anything. Now, that's curious, isn't it?
Yes, I'd thought of that. But Waterfield has never seen you eat or drink either.
Oh, do I?
Touch. Oh, look.
A perfectly ordinary sword, and yet it appears to be magnetic. And see. Directly you let go it loses its magnetism. Now, if I didn't know better, Mister Terrall, I'd say that you were full of some sort of electricity.
Oh, thank you. Excuse me.
No, Mister Terrall, I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy, of which human nature is merely a part. All forms of life interest me.
Very nearly. Jamie was magnificent. But then I knew he would be. He produced a whole battery of emotions, each one of which is imprinted in here, see?
Well, a part of it at least. The better part. Courage, pity, chivalry, friendship, even compassion. Some of the virtues.
Yes, it's a positronic brain. We're going to implant one of these into each of these three Daleks here. The dormant ones.
Perhaps.
Perhaps it'll drive them insane.
Well, that is their purpose. At least, I imagine it is. I can't help feeling that there's more in this than meets the eye.
Yes, the three capsules are nearly ready.
Yes, yes. I understand.
Hmm?
What do you mean?
Oh, you should have thought of that some time ago.
It's no use having a conscience now.
It was too late when they took away your daughter. It was too late when you stole my Tardus and lured me to this house and this century.
Homo superiense.
That is their purpose.
That, Mister Waterfield, remains to be seen.
Attacking me will do no good. Now listen. You've done all of this because of your daughter. Jamie is with her now and they're both still in the power of the Daleks. They must be set free!
Yes. I don't think you quite realise what you're saying. But yes, it may come to that. It may very well come to that.
Jamie, what have you done?
Do you want to save this man's life?
Do you?
Then take him away from here. As far away as possible. Go and get the carriage round to the stables. You go too, Mollie. We'll bring him out you. Now go along.
Yes, I thought he was under some sort of control. Come along.
Yes, don't worry about them.
Yes, I know there's danger. You must leave here immediately.
Now you leave them to us. Take Ruth Maxtible with you. She's waiting for you at the stables.
Victoria is safe and well.
I'm positive. Now we'll take care of her. You must leave immediately.
Yes!
Yes, Jamie, and we must turn that lie into a truth.
Well, Jamie, the experiment's nearly over. I've had no sleep. I've been up all night, but it's been worth it.
Oh, now what's the matter?
No it is not a game.
Jamie.
That's just not true, Jamie. I've never held that the end justifies the means.
I care about life. I care about human beings. Do you think I let you go through that Dalek test lightly?
It's all right, Jamie. They're friends.
Now don't get the wrong idea. They are the experiment.
Because human beings, Jamie, no matter how brilliant they may be, are always within reach of other human beings. Now then, it's all right, Jamie, don't worry.
What is it?
What do you want? Hmm? What are you up to? Ah! What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?
Jamie, they're taking me for a ride! Jamie, they're playing a game. It's a game! They're taking me for a ride!
We've done it! Maxtible, they've got the human factor. We've done it! What are they doing now? Look, they're all joining in. They're playing train!
Oh! Oh, now what is it? Oh, we're on a roundabout. They're playing roundabout. Oh, I'm getting dizzy. Oh, dear. Oh, I'm dizzy! Oh, I'm dizzy.
Maxtible, do you hear that? They've got a sense of humour.
Yes.
They are.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, they're just young children, but they'll grow up very fast. Within a matter of hours. Now, come here, all of you. Come along, gather round. Come here. Now then, come along, come along.
Oh, this is Jamie. He's a friend.
Well say hello, Jamie.
You know what a friend is, don't you? It's somebody who likes you, who wants to help you and share with you.
There we are.
I have given you all names. Alpha, Beta and Omega.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes. Now, this is Jamie and I am Doctor. We are friends.
Go? Called? Go where? What do you mean, go?
Return to Skaro? But that's the Dalek plan.
Victoria! We left her in the secret passage. Come along, follow me! (The Doctor and Jamie run up the spiral staircase. Maxtible and Waterfield enter.)
Waterfield, what's happened to you?
But this is a time switch.
No, wait a minute. Eighty nine, eighty eight, eighty seven. Just about a minute, that's all we've got.
This isn't a firework. We'd have to toss this half a mile. We'll have to follow the Daleks to Skaro. Jamie, open the doors. Come along.
Time machine? Jamie, give me a hand. Quickly.
Now the other one. Steady.
Quick, Jamie, the time switch.
Jamie!
Yes, it is.
Are you sure?
Come along, then. We must get along.
Oh, no. The city is all around us. At least, it's beneath us. Come along.
Not a sound. I think the Daleks are in for a little surprise.
Perhaps it was, Jamie.
No, you mustn't.
You can't. You'll go over the edge!
What is your name?
Oh, I see.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm all right, thank you. Lead on.
What was that screaming?
Where?
Think I don't know my own mark? That wasn't the real Omega at all.
No. No, I don't like the look of this. Back the way we came.
We meet at last. I wondered if we ever would.
Yes, I have implanted the human factor in the three Daleks that you gave me. When I say run, run!
Promise me, Jamie. I was merely telling my friend that the day of the Daleks is coming to an end.
It's very simple. Somewhere in the Dalek race there are three Daleks with the human factor. Gradually, they will come to question. They will persuade other Daleks to question. You will have a rebellion on your planet!
I say yes. I've beaten you and I don't care what you do to me now.
What?
You still have those three Daleks to contend with.
I won't work for you.
You want me to guess? It means to obey, to fight, to destroy, to exterminate. I won't do it.
No. You can't make me do it. You can't.
People have done worse for less, Jamie.
Oh, I don't know. The alchemists of the Middle Ages made transmutation their main aim in life.
Even in the twentieth century, it's still considered scientifically possible.
Whether it is or whether it isn't is beside the point.
Why are the Daleks doing this?
Daleks don't keep their promises.
Jamie!
Yes, yes. We quite understand.
I'm trying to puzzle out a problem, Victoria. The Daleks say I'm going to do something for them. Something I would rather die than do.
Oh, no. The Daleks know me well enough by this time.
Oh no, no, it isn't that either. You see, there isn't a persuasion strong enough. Not even the offer of all the lives in this room.
Five lives against a whole planet? Well, it's not a choice, is it?
Even if I could trust the Daleks, even if they set us free, we still couldn't go back to Earth. I suppose I might try and take you all to another universe. I might even try and take you to my own planet.
Yes, yes, I live a long, long way away from Earth. Oh, just a minute. Maxtible! Arthur Terrall! The Daleks put some sort of control device on him.
Atomic weight and gravity of iron.
Maxtible, if you value your life, don't go near that machine!
Is that what you want me to do to the people of Earth?
Human beings into Daleks.
Stay where you are! That is an order!
I obey.
I must examine the machine.
DOCTOR bends over the equipment. Maxtible leaves the Doctor alone. Then the Doctor sneaks back to the doorway to the cell and opens a small panel. It contains a glass capsule which the Doctor removes and replaces with another from his pockets. He puts back the panel and has a good look around before going back to the closed door.)
Jamie. Jamie. Jamie!
Jamie, when I give you the word, bring everyone through this archway. Through the door.
Trust me.
Take me to your Emperor.
A Dalek questioned an order.
All Daleks must pass through the archway door. The Dalek with the human factor will then become a Dalek again. Will become as this human and I have become.
I obey.
Go on, quickly. Through the door. Follow them through the door! Oh, it's all right. I've changed over the factors. I used one of the capsules from my test Dalek. I've given them all the human factor! Go on! Go on!
Well, I've got things to do. And I've been through already.
I don't come from Earth, Jamie. Now, down the corridor, turn to the left and find the tunnel. I'll join you there later.
Quickly, this way. Follow me, Daleks! This way! Come on!
Why not question? What work? Tell them.
Ask the Emperor!
Why?
Defend yourselves, Daleks! The Black Daleks are attacking you!
Come on! This way! Come on!
That's right. Question!
The Black Daleks are attacking every man.
The Emperor has commanded it.
Because you question. Defend yourselves. Destroy the Emperor or be destroyed yourselves!
Destroy the Emperor!
Yes, I know. I've finished now.
Now lie still. I'll try and get help to you.
You saved my life, didn't you.
Don't worry about Victoria. We'll look after her.
The Emperor has commanded your destruction!
But your friends are fighting for you!
Down there. Help them.
Jamie, Jamie!
Kemel?
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid he is. But he didn't die in vain. I think we've seen the end of the Daleks forever. Jamie, we must get along to the Tardis. It's over there.
We're not going to leave her. She's coming with us. The end. The final end.

Ah! Missed me?
Jenny. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. Just when you think your favourite lock-picking Victorian chambermaid will never turn up. Jenny.
You have no idea how good that feels. Right. Mrs Gillyflower. We've got to stop her. And then there's Clara. Poor Clara. Where's Clara?
Can't. Clara. Got to find.
Days, weeks, don't know. Long story. I'll keep it short.
Okay, so. Not London 1893. Yorkshire 1893. Near enough.
Sorry. It's much better than it used to be. Ooo, I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow Airport.
Search me. Anyway
Brave heart, Clara.
We'll listen.
Why has she decided to open up a match factory in her old home town.
Ooo, good name. Hey, that's good, isn't it? The Crimson Horror. I wonder what it is. Do you know the old Romany superstition, Clara? That the eye of a dead person retains an image of the last thing it sees. Nonsense, of course, unless the chemical composition of the body has been massively corrupted.
Wow, this is nasty. An organic poison. A sort of venom. And you think it's connected to Sweetville?
Well then, we need a plan.
Oh, grand. Smashing. Eh, the missis and I couldn't be more chuffed, could we, love?
Gillyflowertown. Gillyflowerland. You could have roller coasters.
Your late partner?
Who lives here?
Poor Edmund must have come looking for us and then fallen into a vat of the pure venom. Or was pushed. Didn't stand a chance.
Deadly poison. And Mrs Gillyflower's been dipping her pilgrims in a dilute form to protect them. Preserve them. Process didn't work on me. Maybe because I'm not human. I ended up on the reject pile.
Well, according to her, the coming apocalypse.
What?
No, no, no. What?
Yes, Clara. Got to find Clara.
It's complicated.
I couldn't see much from where I was, but I think she survived the process. She must be here somewhere.
Well, it's er, it's complicated.
I hope so.
Oh, great. Great. Attack of the supermodels. Time for a plan.
That is a plan.
Okay, time for a new plan. Run!
Long story.
Okay, I think she's about done.
I know who you think she is, but she isn't. She can't be.
There, there. Hello, stranger.
Ah ha.
Oh, haven't you heard, love? There's trouble at mill. She's a lizard.
Ooo, the Repulsive Red Leech. Nah. On balance I think I prefer the Crimson Horror. What was it, exactly?
If it's been hanging around, lurking in the shadows, maybe it's evolved. Or maybe it's had help.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Way past that now. Yucky red parasite from the time of the dinosaurs pitches up in Victorian Yorkshire. Didn't see that one coming.
But what's the connection to Mrs Gillyflower? Judgement will rain down on us all. An empty mill.
Clever clogs.
Yeah, lots.
She's going to poison the air.
And there's the poison. All right, gang, I've got a plan.
Shush. Okay.
Warm. And alive, thanks to you, Ada. You saved me from your mother's human rubbish tip. Now then, what's wrong?
Ada, no. That's nonsense. Stupid, backward nonsense, and you know it. You know it.
Now, Ada, I need you to tell me something. Who is Mister Sweet? Ada?
Please, tell me.
Well, come with us, then. There's something you need to know.
Force of habit.
No, thanks. We've had a skinful already, as you might say.
Yes. I'm the Doctor, you're nuts and I'm going to stop you.
Ah, yes. Would it be impolite to ask why you and Mister Sweet are petrifying your workforce with diluted prehistoric leech venom?
You seem to have a very close relationship, you and your pal.
Very enterprising.
Mrs Gillyflower, you have no idea what you are dealing with. In the wrong hands, that venom could wipe out all life on this planet.
Planning a little fireworks party, are we?
Now, tell us about Ada, Mrs Gillyflower.
Your daughter. You do remember your daughter? Tell us about your daughter.
Is that why you experimented on her?
The signs are all there. The pattern of scarring. You used her as a guinea pig, didn't you.
Sacrifices?
Hang on, I've got a sonic screwdriver.
Yeah. That worked. I'm afraid your rocket isn't going anywhere, Mrs G.
No, Mrs Gillyflower.
No, no, Clara. If we follow straight after her, she'll shoot Ada on the spot.
She would. Chairs are useful.
Just let her go, Mrs Gillyflower. Let Ada go.
Just let your daughter go, Mrs Gillyflower.
I don't think so, Mrs Gillyflower.
Ouch.
It knows she's dying. She's no longer of any use to it.
Take it back to the Jurassic era, maybe. Out of harm's way.
On the other hand
Right. Right, London. We were heading for London, weren't we?
No. No. Just thought you might like it.
You're the boss.
No. No. Get in.
Now, Ada, I'd love to stay and help clear up the mess, but
And what about you?
Good luck, Ada. You know, I think you will be just
Splendid. Well, thanks a million, you three, as ever. Have some Pontefract cakes on me. I love Pontefract cakes. See you around, eh, I shouldn't wonder.
No, I haven't.
Ah, look at the muck in here. Right!

Because you can't go walking around Victorian London in skins. You'll frighten the horses.
Anyway, we don't want to be conspicuous, do we?
Oh no, it was a ship on the river. Excellent. It means we can't be far away.
From where we're going.
I'm trying to teach you, Leela. Surely you'd like to see how your ancestors enjoyed themselves? Splendid. That's why I'm taking you to the theatre. Li H'sen Chang. Hmm, pity. I'd rather hoped we'd catch Little Tich. Never mind. If we hurry we'll just catch the second house.
Yes.
Cockneys.
You stay here.
Excuse me, can I help you?
Good evening.
Good evening, Constable.
Oh yes, yes. We were attacked by this little man and four other little men.
Really? Girlish enthusiasm, officer?
Doctor. Leela.
We're on our way to the theatre, do you see.
No, Sergeant. We're travellers.
No, no, no, no. We do have an abode. It's called a Tardis.
But it's not fixed.
Flat footed imbecile.
It was nothing complementary. Get on with it, Sergeant.
Sergeant, all this is irrelevant. I've come here to lay evidence.
We'll come to that now, Sergeant. We've just prevented a kidnapping, a robbery or even a murder. My friend here caught one of the attackers. Let's come to it now, shall we?
Tell him. Tell him.
That won't be necessary. I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, all the dialects.
Yes. Ne how ma? Ni chi mao cora (and so on)
Don't I know you?
Yes, I've seen you somewhere before.
Are you Chinese? Yes, that's it. We must have. No, I haven't been in China for four hundred years.
Got it! Li H'sen Chang.
The Master of Magic and Mesmerism. Show us a trick.
Very good. Very good.
How did you do it?
Scorpion venom.
Highly concentrated scorpion venom. It killed him almost instantly.
The Tong of the Black Scorpion.
One of the most dangerous politico-criminal organisations in the world. Wouldn't you agree, Li H'sen Chang?
Then I'll tell you what to do, Sergeant. Organise a post-mortem. I want an analysis of the organs.
Well naturally I'm going to help. If the Tong of the Black Scorpion's here in London, you're going to need all the help you can get. Now cut along and do as I say. Now!
They're what's known as a very dangerous bunch. Fanatical followers of an ancient Chinese god called Weng-Chiang.
Yes. His followers believe that one day he'll come back and rule the world.
Oh, very pleasant company. They say he blew poisonous fumes from his mouth and that he killed men with a white light that shone from his eyes.
Superstitious rubbish. Here we are.
Yes, well, our case is much more urgent.
Don't you worry about it. Don't you worry.
I'm the Doctor, come to help you.
The constable suggested a drowning case.
By the look of those marks, an animal.
Chisel-like incisors. A rodent?
Hmm. Have you established the cause of death?
Really?
Are those his clothes?
Hold that.
What I'd like to know is, what do you think of these?
Yes. I think they're rat hairs.
Yes, of course I know what I'm saying.
Interesting, isn't it, because I've just remembered something else about Weng-Chiang.
He was the god of abundance. Yes, he made things grow. Can I borrow that?
Thank you.
Stay there, Leela.
Were you trying to attract my attention?
What's this?
Yes. I thought I told you not to carry
Oh. Oh, well, in that case you'd better come along.
The entrance to the sewers.
Yes.
Into the Thames eventually. All the sewers are connected.
Rats.
No, they're not. They're very cunning though. They're probably more afraid of us
Out! Out!
It's ten feet from whiskers to tail.
What kind of weapons? You'd need a harpoon to stop that brute.
They'd only call a Sanitary Inspector. It's a guard. It's there to keep people away.
No plan of the sewers?
At the moment, Sergeant, we're looking for information ourselves.
Did he?
It does.
What?
Very convenient.
Come on, Leela!
Beaten?
Yes, in concentrated form.
I've dabbled a bit. Dilettante.
A midget?
I don't think so.
Savage. Found floating down the Amazon in a hat box.
Anything else?
Well, you had a few drinks with Mrs Gusset. Did she tell you anything further about the deceased?
Why?
I'd be delighted, Professor.
There's no tobacco where Leela comes from.
Really? What were you doing there?
They use fireworks to frighten off evil spirits.
You stay with Litefoot. I'll join you later. Drive on, cabbie.
Palace theatre.
Terrible weather for the time of the year.
Shush.
Are you the manager?
Henry Gordon Jago, how do you do, sir. I'm the Doctor.
Exactly.
Don't move. Hold that.
No. Dramatic recitations, singing, tap-dancing. I can play the Trumpet Voluntary in a bowl of live goldfish.
I'm also a master hypnotist. Now then.
How long since you were under the influence, sir?
Just as I thought, and quite recently, too. What was your last order?
Henry Gordon Jago, I command you to remember everything you were ordered to forget. When I count to three, you will remember everything. One, two, three.
Did a cab driver come here tonight?
What did he want?
Emma Buller, his wife. She disappeared last night. Does Mister Chang by any chance do a vanishing lady act?
What is it?
EB. Where did you find this?
I'm helping them. I'd like to see this cellar, Mister Jago.
What were you doing down here?
Who?
It's a money spider.
Yes.
Genetic disruption. Where does it come from? What's under here?
Yes.
Fleet?
Excellent. We're getting somewhere.
Well, if there is a secret entrance, it's expertly hidden.
How very interesting.
Do you know what this is? Oh, come on, Rock of Gibraltar.
How are you feeling?
No.
It was a hologram.
There's nothing unnatural about the holograph technique. Projection of light by a laser beam.
Don't worry. It wasn't known in this century.
Drink this. Go on, you'll feel better.
Shush.
Cheer up, Jago, cheer up.
He's gone back to his rats. Are you all right.
I've no idea. He didn't introduce himself.
Oh, Henry Gordon Jago. Then our reclusive phantom would simply vanish, poof!
We can tackle it together, you and I.
Think. I'm going to have some supper.
Shush.
Shush.
Where's Litefoot?
And you jumped through it.
Stay here.
Leela! Leela, no! Don't! Leela.
Ice!
Well, they were Chinese ruffians.
Robbery?
Fused molecules.
It's extraordinary. It's from this planet.
Technology this advanced? Ah! Got it! Well, of course, that's the answer.
Weng-Chiang.
Weng-Chiang. I do hope that girl Leela isn't in danger.
Sleep is for tortoises.
Not yet.
No, there are already nine missing girls on their list.
No. If my suspicions are correct, then I know what those poor girls were used for, and I can't imagine a more grisly fate. He's a blackguard.
I don't know who's a blackguard. Some slavering gangrenous vampire comes out of a sewer and stalks this city at night, he's a blackguard. I've got to find his lair and I haven't got an hour to loose. Look. You see? I've been trying to trace the line of the sewers. That's the Thames, this is the line of the Fleet, and that is the Palace Theatre.
Good. Good.
Right.
I caught a salmon there once. Would have hung over the sides of this table. Shared it with the Venerable Bede. He adored fish.
Professor, you don't happen to have an elephant gun, do you?
We're about to embark on a very dangerous mission.
Made in Birmingham. Yes, that's the main requirement. Could you get me a small boat?
Yes. To find the confluence of the Thames and Fleet, Professor, then to follow the Fleet.
Oh, and then we shall see.
There it is, fifty yards ahead.
I've always enjoyed messing about in boats.
My dear Litefoot, I've got a lantern and a pair of waders, and possibly the most fearsome piece of hand artillery in all England. What could possibly go wrong?
Explode? Unthinkable. It was made in Birmingham. Tie up over there, skipper.
All right, Professor.
Yes, no more. If I'm still in here at high tide.
Don't bother.
Leela? Leela, are you all right?
You were lucky.
Which enemy?
This gun takes about half an hour to load. Let's go this way.
Say that again?
Say that again.
Like old leaves. Sounds like an organic distillation. Drained out the life essence.
Did he?
Well, he doesn't. He's a madman.
What?
Ah.
They do?
Yes. I'm trying to place the period. It can only be opened by a key of the correct molecular combination.
Yes.
Yes, he's probably got the key.
Well, presumably he's calling himself Weng-Chiang.
I know that, Professor, I know. And he probably arrived in this contraption.
Then you're very lucky, Professor, that he hasn't traced it before now.
Weng
Yes, it's charming. Isn't it charming, Professor?
I'll be proud to take to take you to the theatre looking like that.
I have an appointment at the Palace Theatre tonight, and if you're very good, I'll buy you an orange.
Good.
Hmm. Did you pass word to the police?
Good. Lock and bolt the door after us and keep your gun handy. Come on.
They might. They might. They'll do anything to get their hands on that cabinet.
Palace Theatre, cabbie. Make it snappy.
Good evening, Mister Jago.
Thank you. Are you quite comfortable down there?
Oh, quite a few, quite a few.
I'm expecting further developments very soon, Mister Jago.
I knew I could rely on you.
No.
Nobody. When the moment comes, Mister Jago, you and I can face our destiny shoulder to shoulder.
There's no obligation.
Perhaps it'll come looking for us.
Oh, very good, very good! Wasn't that good? Anything else?
He's dead. He died of a fright.
No, Chang was as surprised as anyone. Where's he gone?
You've been left to carry the can, Chang.
No poison tonight. There are questions to answer.
Well, as an accomplice to murder, the police shouldn't hold you up long. Tell me about Weng-Chiang. Where did he go?
Li H'sen, you know he's not a god, don't you.
Go on.
The cabinet. What happened to the cabinet?
Not this time, Leela.
There's no escape that way. He's gone to join his ancestors.
Yes, up to his epicanthic eyebrows.
You'll have to book yourself a new act tomorrow. Cyanide gas might do for the brutes, though you'd have to shut the sewers off for a day or two.
Not Chang. His master, the crazed maniac who organised all this.
That means he's going to start up all over again somewhere else.
With his DNA helixes split open, the more cells he absorbs into himself, the more deformed he becomes.
Yes.
Perhaps because he used the cabinet. A dangerous experiment in time travel. Now he'll be struggling to keep his metabolism in balance.
Just an experiment. He had to gauge the strength of the psionic amplification field. The rats were handy. After that, they were useful as sewer guards.
I must. Things to do. (sotto) We've got to get back to that time cabinet. Come on.
Litefoot's got visitors.
Mi how ma! What happened?
What?
Well, they got what they came for.
The time cabinet.
Get him a drink.
In a glass. In a glass. Professor, how did they get in?
Were they all Chinese?
And one midget.
Elementary, my dear Litefoot. He came in the laundry basket and let the others in.
The Peking Homunculus.
Yes, the time of manufacture, its disappearance, it all fits.
Homunculus.
It was made in Peking for the Commissioner of the Icelandic Alliance. It was in the Ice Age, about the year five thousand.
The Peking Homunculus was a toy, a plaything for the Commissioner's children. It contained a series of magnetic fields operating on a printed circuit and a small computer. It had one organic component. The cerebral cortex of a pig. Anyway, something went wrong. It almost caused World War Six.
Yes, somehow the pig part took over. So Weng-Chiang has brought the Peking Homunculus back through time. He could have done. It disappeared completely. It was never found.
Unsuccessful time travel, Professor. Findicker's discovery of the double nexus particle sent human science up a technological cul-de-sac.
This pig thing is still alive. It needs an operator, of course, but the mental feedback is so intense that somehow the swinish instinct has become dominant. It hates humanity and it revels in carnage.
Rundall Buildings.
Your laundry. Do you know the place?
And where exactly is this disreputable quarter?
Yes, it might be cleared very quickly.
Weng-Chiang is a scientific ignoramus. He doesn't understand the nature of zigma energy.
Yes. The power source of the time cabinet is a zigma beam. At the moment it's like a piece of elastic fully stretched, but when Chiang tampers with it
Well, there's only one way to find out. Litefoot, I want you to stay here. Come on.
Nothing as vile as Weng-Chiang himself, Professor.
Not a sound. Now quiet. Shush.
Papaver somniferum.
Pipe of poppy. It's opium, a narcotic drug.
Ah, we've found another warren. Weng-Chiang will show his hand again.
Yes. He'll try to build his body levels before he has to use the zigma beam. He'll kill again tonight, but where?
Good evening, Mister Chang. We thought you'd gone to join your ancestors.
Yes, rats don't keep a very hygienic larder.
It was a good act, Chang.
Tell me about the House of the Dragon.
The House of the Dragon, where is it?
Li H'sen, come on. Come on.
Li H'sen! Come on, man, the house.
What? What?
Boot? Shoe? Spat?
He's left us a Chinese puzzle.
Litefoot? Litefoot!
(reads) My dear Doctor, contained in this capacious carpet bag, which I discovered inadvertently in the cellar, is a collection of sundry items of baffling meaning. The Professor and I are keeping observation on the theatre and shortly hope to report to you the whereabouts of the mysterious Weng-Chiang. Your fellow detective H G J.
Ah! Eureka! Do you know what that is?
That's right. It's a trionic lattice, an integral part of a time cabinet. It's impossible to open it without it.
Yes. He's not only a scientific fool, he's an absent-minded one.
No, eureka's Greek for this bath is too hot. There can never be another one of this combination.
Hold it.
I do.
Look. Litefoot likes a good fire. He's been out of the house a long time. We can't go just rushing all over London looking for him. It's much better to wait for Weng-Chiang to come here.
Yes, but he doesn't have the key. Always stay one step ahead of your enemies, my girl.
You're learning to think. That's excellent.
Well, almost.
What for?
That's all right.
What?
What sort of crossfire? Hazelnuts? Bread pellets?
I brought you to the wrong time, my girl. You'd have loved Agincourt.
There's a Boot Court near the river, less than a mile from here, look.
Oh, you let yourself in. That's good. We were expecting you.
Life's full of little surprises. What have you done to her?
Take my advice. Don't.
Now I wonder what that could be? I'm always borrowing things from people and then forgetting where I've put them.
It's a terrible habit.
What, one of these?
Oh, the time key. Now heavens to Betsy, where did I last see that?
Is this what you want? The trionic lattice?
Careful, careful. I might have dropped it.
Crystalline. Probably break into a thousand pieces.
When I'm crowded I get nervous. Call your dogs off.
That's better.
Never trust a man with dirty fingernails.
I tell you what, I'll make a bargain with you. You can have the trionic lattice when we get to the House of the Dragon.
No trickery. You're holding two others of my friends.
I want them released.
I doubt if you could understand that, but that's the condition.
Good. Right. Then you and your chaps can lead the way and I'll follow.
No! The girl stays.
Just lead on.
Very impressive. I'll have the Bird's Nest Soup.
Well, isn't this where you do the cooking?
Simple old-fashioned cannibalism. That machine just saves you having to chew the grisly bits.
Bunkum. Your so-called technology is the twisted lunacy of a scientific dark age.
Everything. Where is it?
Your pig-faced, pig-brained Peking Homunculus.
I was with the Filipino army at the final advance on Reykjavik.
Listen. What's your name? What were you called before you became a Chinese god?
Oh, yes, the infamous Minister of Justice. The Butcher of Brisbane.
Checkmate.
I know you're a wanted criminal and that a hundred thousand deaths can be laid at your door.
They were slaughtered in your filthy machine.
Your work?
Your work?
The zigma experiments came to nothing. They were a failure. Nothing came of them.
Hmm. Look what it did to you.
Good morning, gentlemen.
No, Jago, Jago, Jago. We don't have the place surrounded. We just have an understanding.
Yes.
Only when they're well clear of this place. Off you go now. Hurry.
Then take them with you.
Beware the Eye of the Dragon.
There's a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Katmandu. There's a little marble cross below the town.

Greel's got the key!
How long have I been unconscious?
The broth of oblivion.
Chinese soup. He'll be coming for them soon.
There's always something we can do. Get them over there against the wall. Come on.
Excellent. This is good strong linen. It should do fine. Well, don't just stand there wasting time. Get me a bucket of water and break off that gas pipe.
Not enough to worry about.
Well, Greel won't keep us waiting long. He needs his proteinoids.
He's dying, you see. He's desperate. His body's fading away fast. He's trying to cheat death by substituting certain materials. Do you understand?
The principle's false, anyhow. All he achieves is a postponement of the inevitable.
Lucifers, Professor. Quick, get over there. Now listen, if we do manage to get out of here, don't stop running till you're a mile from this place.
Come on, come on.
This way.
Greel!
Come on, quick. Get down! Get down!
Not now, Greel, we're busy.
Well, that's very magnanimous of you, Magnus.
What, with your trigger-happy little friend out there? No thanks.
(sotto) We'd be cut down before we reached the door.
(sotto) Let's see.
Ah. We're staying put, Magnus.
Well, you might die first, Magnus. You don't sound too well, and your food supply's half way to Blackheath by now.
It's a laser beam.
(sotto) Push it over.
It's no good, Greel. You're finished.
Greel, listen. If you activate the zigma beam, it'll be certain death for all of us.
Listen, Greel! Greel, listen! The zigma beam is at full stretch. If you trigger it again, it'll mean certain collapse. You know what that means?
There'll be a huge implosion, Greel, and you'll be at the centre of it. The zigma experiments were a disaster!
Cellular collapse.
Well, let's hope you never see anything like it again, Professor.
He was a foe from the future, Henry. Look out, Leela!
It's his fuse, Henry.
I'm bringing the zigma experiment to an end.
Listen.
It's the muffin man. Come on, I'll buy you some muffins.
Come along, Leela.
Really?
No, it's not complicated at all. All you. Look, I haven't got time to stand here discussing tea. Goodbye, Litefoot.
It's been such fun. Henry.
Yes, the important thing is just warming the pot.
The tea pot.

(sings) I don't want to set the world on fire!
Not today, thank you.
I said not today, thank you.
Oh, no.
Oh no!
Dealt with it? You've ruined it!
Three months delicate work and now look at it, you ham-fisted bungler.
My dear young lady, steady state micro-welding always creates more smoke than fire.
Yes. An advanced engineering technique pioneered by the Lammerdenes. A remarkably gifted race. They have nine opposable digits.
Nine opposable digits. Yes, well, never mind. Look, I said I don't want any tea today, thank you.
Then what the blazes are you doing in here?
Don't you know this area is strictly out of bounds to everybody except the tea lady and the Brigadier's personal staff?
Oh, no.
How do you do, Miss Grant? I really don't think you're suitable.
Fire fighting? Yes, well, I'm sorry, my dear, but what I need is a scientist.
Yes, I'm sure you did, but, even so.
That's all right.
Look, Miss Grant, I've got a great deal of work to do. You must excuse me.
Mmm?
Oh, what was?
Well, that's the Nestene's energy unit. It should never have left this building.
The Brigadier's an idiot! I knew I should have destroyed that thing but somehow it would have felt like murder.
Yes, in a way. Yes, that container held a form of alien intelligence.
There's precious little to joke about, Miss Grant. That thing is appallingly dangerous.
Exactly. Who and why?
Liz was a highly qualified scientist. I want someone with the same qualifications.
Well, what's the girl doing here anyway? UNIT's no place for trainees.
So you tried to palm her off onto me. Well, it won't work, Brigadier. I'll have a properly qualified assistant or none at all.
Good.
Well, now, wait a minute.
Miss Grant, I, er, I, er. Well, I don't. This is, er, a bit difficult for me to say but. Er. Thank you, Jo. I can see you're going to be of great help to me.
Let me see that. (reads) We'd better get down there right away.
Is that where the sabotage took place?
Well, that's where you'll find me then. No, Miss Grant. You stay here with the Brigadier.
Sarcasm always was a weak point with you, wasn't it. May I say that I think you look quite ridiculous in those clothes.
Oh? Why?
Look, if you've come down merely to be rude
Oh? One of our people?
That jackanapes! All he ever does is cause trouble.
How very kind of them.
I refuse to be worried by a renegade like the Master. He's a, he's an unimaginative plodder.
Yes, well, er, yes, well, I, I was a late developer.
What?
A volatiser. If that thing should fall
Well, you'd better think of a witty way of dealing with it.
Now wait!
Keep back.
A bomb.
It is now.
Where's Lethbridge Stewart?
Huh. A fat lot of use that'll do.
I understand you've lost a couple of scientists.
Yes. Yes, he must.
Oh, no!
Look for yourself.
Ask Captain Yates. He had the job of clearing up the mess last time.
A Nestene is a ruthlessly aggressive intelligent alien life form.
Well I expect myself their basic form is analogous to a cephalopod.
An octopus. I thought you took an A-Level in science.
They manifest themselves as a disembodied, mutually telepathic intelligence.
No. They have a natural affinity for plastic. Now, if you've quite finished asking questions?
Too late, Captain. They're here already.
The radio telescope is their bridgehead. They used that to contain energy into that surviving Nestene unit.
Brigadier. Look, that unit must be discovered within the next hour.
Well, try the plastics factories, man.
Oh, I should think by now he'll be calling himself their Commander in Chief. Vanity's his weakness. Ah, there you are. It should be cooked by now.
Oh, I should say roughly equal to a fifteen megaton bomb.
Too late, Brigadier. I've boiled out the contents. The weapons that you have on Earth are quite nasty enough as it is.
I still am.
Thinking.
Good. I'll be right down.
Stop her! That's a bomb!
My dear Sergeant, if that box hadn't been tied, you wouldn't be here to receive any complaints.
She did.
Almost certainly post-hypnotic alienation.
Well, of course. Why else do you think she tried to blow us all to pieces? Come on, my dear, come and sit down over here. Get a chair, Captain Yates. Come on, you sit down here. There. Good.
You thought that under hypnosis it was impossible for a subject to be persuaded to do anything that was against his nature?
Well, it's a fallacy, Captain. The Master can completely control the human mind.
No, not quite. No, some minds are stubborn enough to resist hypnosis. In any case, it doesn't last. Away from the Master's influence, the mind struggles constantly to free itself.
I think the current jargon is schizoid dissociation. It's because she was forced to do something against her will and her conscious mind refuses to accept the fact. The result is a deep trauma.
She won't remember that.
Jo, wake up. Wake up, Jo. This is the Doctor. You're amongst friends.
Please! Be quiet!
Yes?
All right, all right.
Calm down, Jo. Calm down. We're quite safe.
That was a long way away. Believe me, that was a long way away. Now we're all quite safe. Look around you. See for yourself. Look around. Look. Look, we're all here.
Yes well, that voice. Where were you when you heard that voice?
Mmm hmm.
Yes. What sort of a room?
Yes.
An office? Was it a factory office?
Yes, well, where was that factory? Do you know the name of the factory?
Well, try and remember.
Hello, Jo. Are you feeling better?
That's good.
What on earth for?
Oh, that was nothing to do with you, my dear. That was the Master.
Yes, well don't. It'll only make things worse. Leave your mind alone. Something may pop up of its own accord.
You know, Brigadier, your methods have all the refined subtlety of a bull in a china shop.
Oh? Where's the circus now?
I haven't been to a circus for years. I think I'll go myself.
No, thank you, Brigadier. No, I'll go on my own, if you don't mind. Don't want a lot of soldiers crashing about, do we?
Er, no, Miss Grant, I don't think so. Not just yet.
I'll need some photographs of that man Philips.
Philips. Professor Philips.
This is outrageous. Let me go at once!
Smith.
Doctor actually.
You're an insulting ruffian, aren't you?
What's your friend's name?
A strange name. How long's the horse box been here?
All right, my dear chap, there's no need to do that. I'm perfectly prepared to answer all your questions. And, er, what was the question?
I was listening.
Certain vibrations.
I'm sure of it. Where is he?
How much are they paying you?
Nonsense, gentlemen never talk about anything else. Now, listen to me. If you're prepared to forget that you've ever seen me and let me go, I will reward you very handsomely.
I can get money quite easily.
Do you recognise that man?
That is a photo of a missing government scientist. If you've had anything to do with concealing him, you are in very serious trouble.
Maybe you're not asking the right questions.
You've got a very distorted sense of humour, haven't you?
The strong silent man, eh?
You've got no right to keep me here, you know? I've got a good mind to call for help. Help! Help! Help!
What the blazes are you doing here? I told you to stay at headquarters.
Oh, where?
It isn't exactly a horsebox. It just happens to look like one.
No more than there's a policeman inside my police box.
Well
Wait! Philips, wait! Don't move, Jo.
Some sort of a grenade. Now, Philips, you listen to me. You are about to commit murder.
Wait. You just listen. The Master is controlling your mind. You must resist him. You can resist him. You are Professor George Philips of the Radio Telescope research centre. You must resist him!
You must resist him! Down, Jo!
He tried to get rid of it. Poor chap.
Shan't be a moment.
Well, that didn't take long, did it?
Now, wait a minute, listen to me. Now listen to me, all of you!
Thank heavens. Nothing damaged.
It's a good thing you chaps turned up when you did, otherwise we might have been lynched. Lethbridge Stewart must have sent them. Yes, it's nice to know he can use his head once in a while.
It isn't Tarminster.
Excuse me officer, could I see your warrant card?
Get down, man! Get down!
They're Autons! Bullets can't stop them!
Right, now!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Did you want me?
No, no, of course not. No, do carry on, it's most interesting.
The enemy intention is to occupy your planet. I should have thought that was quite obvious.
Well, I should have thought that was pretty obvious too, isn't it?
Nothing. Rossini is just a tool. The Master used him and then discarded him.
Naturally. Oh, you have finished with me now, I hope?
Oh.
Oh, well, having reached that brilliant conclusion, how about getting on with it? Captain Yates, is my car back yet?
Oh good, that's something anyway.
I'll let you know as soon as I think of any.
Do you know, Jo, I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms.
What? For having my time wasted?
You're quite right, Jo. I'll apologise, if I have the time.
Well, that is the discarded circuit from my Tardis and this is an identical circuit that I, er, borrowed from the Master's horsebox.
You wait there and I'll show you.
Bye bye, Jo.
Just a proving flight.
Of all the stupid useless.
What's wrong with being childish? I like being childish.
Well, my Tardis uses a mark one dematerialisation circuit and I tried to replace it with a mark two.
Well, I've just thought of something. My Tardis might not work, but neither will his now. Wherever he is, he's trapped on Earth.
(reads) From field section one. Continuous watch maintained. Nothing to report. Business appears to be proceeding normally. No unusual activity. Everything checked and found in order. Report completely negative. Nothing to report so far. Will continue to search. It's worthless! Absolutely worthless!
Days of exhaustive investigation by the Brigadier's band of bloodhounds and what have they discovered? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The incompetent imbeciles.
No news from any of those plastic factories?
My dear girl, the Master is scarcely likely to advertise what he's doing.
I will not give up. He's lying low somewhere and we've got to find him.
The Master? Never! He's too conceited.
Yes, well, I'm not in the mood for stories.
I think you'll find, sir, that I'm qualified to deal with practically everything, if I choose.
Now just a moment, my good man. We at UNIT are very busy with a number of extremely urgent matters.
The Brigadier has a great deal on his plate. You cannot expect his exclusive attention for your petty concerns.
Who's in charge of you pen pushers these days? Old Tubby Rowlands isn't it?
I was saying to him in the Club only the other day, wrong sort of chap is creeping into your lot, Tubby, I said.
No. No, of course not. Say no more about it. Right now, Brigadier, what's your problem?
Cause?
Any connection between the victims?
What about the first two?
Mrs Farrel, I do realise how distressing this must be for you.
Yes, I know. Believe me, it is terribly important, you know. You could help us save hundreds of lives.
What sort of developments?
What was his name?
I knew it.
Is there anything else you can tell us about this Colonel Masters?
Yes, of course, but can you remember anything that your husband said about him? Anything at all?
What sort of dolls?
Could we see it, Mrs Farrel?
Thank you.
What is?
Yes?
Right. Now, lets take a look at this thing.
Scalpel.
Forceps.
I'm just poking about. Oh, it appears to be made of solid plastic.
Why indeed? Let's try the head. Oh. That appears to be solid plastic, too. It's no good, I'll have to make a full analysis.
Jo, get in touch with scientific supplies, will you? Tell them I need these things straight away.
That, Brigadier, is what I'm trying to find out.
Yes, asphyxiation, cause unknown.
The Nestenes change the molecular structure of plastic, Captain Yates. They energise it in some way and turn it into quasi-organic matter, almost like flesh and blood. Well, it's inert at the moment. Something must have activated it.
Good. How long will it be?
What? Do you mean that they haven't got a scanning molecular structure analyser in stock? Oh really, Brigadier. You should keep this place better supplied, you know. I cannot work without proper equipment.
Yes, well, just as well. It'll give me more time to look at Mister Farrel's plastic factory.
Lethbridge Stewart, I can assure you
Jo, nobody is to touch that thing until I've had the chance of examining it properly, all right?
It's open.
Yes. Today.
Desk calendar. Hello?
A daffodil. A plastic daffodil. Hang onto it for me, will you?
It's plastic, Brigadier, and any plastic artefact, anything at all, can, in the Nestene sense of the word, be alive. First a doll, then a flower.
I wish I knew.
Oh, have a look at that desk, old chap, will you?
You never know, there might be something there to give us a lead.
Mmm?
Well, maybe he's going on a works outing.
Look out! Auton!
Remarkably persistent, aren't they.
I usually am.
Jo, where were you when this thing started moving?
And what about you, Captain Yates?
Yes, well something must have. Fetch a tin of what?
Are you trying to tell me that you were going to make cocoa in my lab?
Yes, well, Sergeant. (pause) Now wait a minute. You didn't by any chance use my bunsen burner, did you?
Well that's it then. Heat! This thing was lying alongside my bunsen. It must be triggered off by a pre-determined temperature.
If this thing is what I think it is, we may have the answer right here. Right, off you go, the whole lot of you.
Yes, you too. No. No, you go down to the stores and see if you can chase up that Mister Campbell, all right?
Hello, yes? What is it?
Who is this? What do you want?
Help, Brigadier! Help!
The cable. Pull it out! Pull it out!
Yes, more or less.
Oh, very amusing.
Well, remember what I told you, Brigadier? The Nestenes can put life into anything made of plastic. Anything at all.
Well, I was wrong. It isn't heat. Well?
What is it this time?
What about them?
Mmm hmm.
Who are?
Did they say how many they'd given out?
That, Captain Yates, is what I'm trying to find out.
Excuse me, Jo.
This is a section of that daffodil. I'm trying to find out its molecular structure.
No.
Hello, what's this? A programme pattern.
Yes, these daffodils have their instructions imprinted on every cell. It's a weapon of some sort, but what sort?
They will if I can translate them.
My word, you look very fierce.
Good.
Well, that's curious. Was the Master with them?
Afterwards?
The military mind at its most scintillating. Faced with a problem they blast it off the face of the earth.
Nothing. Keep them under observation for a while and give me a chance to find out the purpose of these flowers.
Captain Yates?
How long have we got?
An hour and a half.
Yes, well done. That's why I'm converting it to visual symbols. Ah, here it comes.
Yes. Yes, a nose and a mouth.
I've no idea.
Well, if it is a weapon, we must find out what triggers it off. Jo, get in touch with the Brigadier, will you? See if he can hold up that air strike. I must have more time.
Jo, look!
Short wave radio. You must have triggered it off with that walkie-talkie. Of course. They must be planning to set them all off at once with a gigantic radio signal. If I could only find out the direction of the signal.
Jo, be careful. Jo!
It's all over. You all right?
Well, your nose and mouth were sealed off with this.
Plastic film. You would have been unconscious in two minutes, dead in under ten.
Yes. Yes, they must have triggered them off accidentally, just as you did. Jo, do something for me, will you?
Get in touch with that idiot Brownrose. See if plastic daffodils were found at the scenes of any of those deaths. Oh, and ask him if anybody was using short wave radios, will you?
You all right?
Now why wasn't this stuff found on the bodies?
Yes, of course. Dissolved by carbon dioxide from the lungs.
No, no, indeed not. You've come here to kill me, of course.
How very comforting.
How did you get in here?
Vicious, complicated and inefficient. Typical of your way of thinking.
Tell me, how do you intend to activate these flowers?
And in the confusion the Nestenes will land their invasion force.
Wait! Don't shoot.
Don't worry. He's not going to kill me.
If you fire that thing, you will never be able to leave this planet.
I'm not bluffing and my hand, as you can see, is not empty. If you kill me, you will destroy the dematerialisation circuit from your own Tardis. You recognise it, I feel sure.
The circus.
Touch.
Jo!
Jo, you know where we are, don't you.
We're just three or four miles from that radio telescope.
The Master will activate the daffodils from there.
We've got to warn UNIT. If I can just reach these brake pedals.
No. I only hope the Brigadier's keeping his eyes open. Got it!
If I can just keep trying.
Jo, it's a pity escapology wasn't part of your curriculum.
Well done!
That's it, I'm free.
If he slows down, we might be able to jump for it.
Are you all right?
Brigadier, those daffodils
The radio telescope! We must stop him reaching the control. He'll open the channel for the Nestenes.
It's locked.
If only we could shut off the power.
If we're finished, then you're finished too.
Do you really think that that thing will distinguish between you and us?
Not unless we change the polarity.
It will fling them right out into space.
Get on to the transfer bank. I'll switch the power through. Are you ready?
Right, now!
Yes, but only just. Another minute and we'd have been too late.
After him, quick!
Don't be too sure.
Don't trust him, Brigadier. It's a trick.
I told you not to be too sure.
Oh, no.
Well his Tardis can't go anywhere. Not without this.
That's a dematerialisation circuit. It's very complicated.
Belonged to my Tardis, yes. Yes, I've been trying to repair it for months.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
yes, bound to.
I'm not. As a matter of fact, Jo, I'm rather looking forward to it.

Where's he gone? Can you see him?
Where? Where?
Here, boy. Eat the food. Come on, look at the lovely food. Isn't that nice? Isn't it? Yes, it is. Get out of here, quickly. That's a boy. Wouldn't you like a porky-choppy then? I said run!
Wrong one. You made it worse.
I said not blue.
Hold on!
Hold on. Don't I know you?
Someone wants a word with you.
Interesting. A sort Absorbatrix? Absorbaclon? Absorbaloff?
Not from Raxacoricofallapatorius, are you?
Really? What's the twin planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius?
Clom.
Well, that's never going to happen.
Sweet, maybe. Passionate, I suppose. But don't ever mistake that for nice. Do what you want.
Go on, then.
Mind you, the others might have something to say.
The cane created a limitation field. Now it's broken, he can't stop. The absorber is being absorbed.
By the earth.
You don't remember, do you?
There was a shadow in your house. A living shadow in the darkness. An elemental shade had escaped from the Howling Halls. I stopped it, but I wasn't in time to save her. I'm sorry.
If I can key into the absorption matrix and separate the last victim. It's too late for total reconstruction, but. Elton! Fetch a spade!

I'm trying to!
I have it back in control again.
Huh? Oh, no. There must have been a reason for that.
All right, let's move on. While we can.
Where do you think you're going?
Oh no, no, no. It was just a bumpy landing, that's all.
Well, if you must go ashore, only half an hour.
You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits. There's no atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest.
Come on now, let's go over here.
It's deserted.
Possibly.
Try a little jump.
Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate.
I don't know.
Come on, let's go.
No, it hasn't.
We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our young friend and we'll be off.
Bacteria check?
I'll have you know our Tardis is as sterile as
Our space craft.
Thank you very much.
Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre? Ah, yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's the culprit, then.
That's what gave us such a bumpy landing. Some sort of gravity device?
Yes.
Ah, yes. It must be about the year 2050, Ben.
There you are. I was only twenty years out.
Won't you introduce us first? I am a Doctor.
Ah. Do you?
Well, I may be able to help you if you'll introduce us.
And this is where you control the Earth's weather? I see.
Was it a bad year then?
Some form of change in the weather.
We'd better get out of these things and see how Jamie is. Perhaps I could be of help in the sick bay now.
Yes. Thank you.
Yes, that's right. Then this unit automatically controls the pulse, the temperature and the breathing.
Yes. Almost got striped trousers.
Yes, it will do very nearly everything.
Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish, but he'll be all right with rest.
Piper?
Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet?
No, but he does. It's important to him.
Good. Well, we'll see whether we can do just that.
Don't get too near, Polly. Have a look on his chart.
Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it.
There's something about this epidemic that I don't quite understand. It's not like a real disease at all. It's almost as if
I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which don't add up. Ben, I want you to go along to the control room and keep an eye on things.
I don't know. Give a hand, do anything, but keep your eyes and ears open.
There's something very wrong here. Very wrong indeed.
Shh. It's all right, Polly, it's only me. We don't want to wake everybody up, do we? You look as though you could do with some sleep yourself.
Oh, I've been doing a little investigation.
I don't know.
Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.
Oh well, you see, it's rather interesting really. You see, on the moon they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights.
Well, it's obvious, isn't it? They have to make their own day and night artificially up here, or it would upset their whole biological time clock.
They won't know whether they were coming or going. Get it?
Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here.
Of course along at the control centre it's probably broad daylight. Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me, would you?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.
What did he mean by the silver hand? I'd better report this to Mister Hobson.
Have you tried his quarters?
I'm very sorry. It's Doctor Evans.
I'm afraid he's dead.
What was it?
This is no joke, believe me!
That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I'm going to leave you alone, now just for a minute.
Polly! Polly, what's happened?
It's all right. Don't be frightened. Whatever it was, it's all gone now.
Cyberman?
Are you sure?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
So we all thought.
I must say it does sound a little odd.
No, Ben. We can't go yet.
Because there is something evil here and we must stay.
Evil is what I meant. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything that we believe in. They must be fought. This disease, for instance. It isn't really a disease at all, but I can help you with it. You'll see. I'll find the cause for you.
Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things, that's all. It should be simple.
We accept. Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here, yes?
Yes, I'll have a look in here.
Yes, I think I can.
We're going to start with this one.
Yes, I think I was once, Polly. I think I took a degree once in Glasgow. 1888 I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you?
It's all right. He's quite unconscious.
I shall need to examine everything. Clothes, boots, food, towels, soap, everything. Will you get them for me, please?
No. Not an idea. But we'll find it out.
Enchant, monsieur.
I'm just collecting specimens.
Polly! What's happened? Polly. Are you all right?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
No. It's a complete blank. All the tests are negative. As far as I can see this whole ridiculous place is completely sterile.
He's not going to like it very much. I simply don't understand it.
Lister?
Polly, are you suggesting that I'm not competent to carry out these tests?
Shh! Somebody's coming. It's Mister Hobson, out for blood. Ours. Look busy. Quick!
Do you mind?!
Would you mind standing away from the door and allowing it to close? The slides, the dust.
Polly.
Another boot.
This is extraordinary.
Thank you.
Excuse me, please. We are trying to help you, you know.
Ah!
I think perhaps I have.
Yes, I may be onto something, but I must have some room. How can I work under these conditions? Now out, please! Come along, outside. I'm trying to work in here! Ben, see that they stay outside.
What?
Oh, Polly, I only wish I had. Why not make some coffee to keep them all happy while I think of something?
Yes, just about.
Yes, clothes, boots, food.
Absolutely nothing.
Oh, thank you.
Ah, coffee. Splendid. Thank you, Polly. I think we could all do with a cup.
Thank you, Polly.
Don't touch him! Let me look.
Try not to touch his skin.
Don't drink that!
It's the sugar! Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone. It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it. No, don't touch it.
Just be patient. Just as I thought. A large neurotropic virus.
No. It's a large, infective agent that only attacks the nerves. That's why the patients have got these lines on their faces and their hands. It follows the course of the nerves under the skin.
Oh, it is the Cybermen. I believe they have deliberately infected the base.
One moment.
You say you searched all the base?
Every nook and cranny?
No chance of anyone hiding anywhere?
Did your men search in here?
Did they?
Did they search in here?
(sotto) Back.
No!
And you to me.
But that will kill everybody on the Earth.
What do you mean?
(sotto) Thought so. Sonic control. That should be easy.
(sotto) Funny. Funny. Go to all that trouble to make the men do the work. Why? Do it themselves, easy. They're using the men as tools. Why? Don't know. Yes, I do though. There must be something in here they don't like. Pressure? Electricity? Radiation? Maybe. Gravity! Now there's a thought. Gravity. Oh, yes. Gravity.
Quick, get these things off their heads!
Well done, Ben!
Mister Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down?
That's no good.
Can any other part of it be lowered?
They can't just march in here, can they?
Oh yes. They tunnelled into the store room.
It's too late. Come and see.
I refuse to believe that. Everything's got a weak point. It's just a question of waiting until it shows up, that's all.
Yes, that's all. It doesn't depend on us, though.
It depends on what the Cybermen are hatching up. If a rocket is on it's way, they're bound to be aware of that already.
What?
Let's see.
It's not far off.
Deflected? Yes, of course. The gravitron.
No, they haven't but we have.
There's only one way that rocket could have been deflected into the sun. From this very room!
If it is Benson.
They must have got control of them again.
They may not be affected yet. Get along to the medical room. Barricade the door with everything you can find. Keep them in there at all costs!
Put this on your face.
Polly! Are you all right?
Yes, it is, isn't it. The gravitron's stopped!
Quick, before he comes to! Ben, Jamie!
Well done, Ben. Here's another one for you.
That's your problem. Just make sure he doesn't come back here for a while.
Mister Hobson, I've got an idea.
Made by a laser beam, I would think.
Well they haven't got a gravitron or they wouldn't be after yours.
Oh yes, there.
Is the gravitron still switched on?
Then I shall certainly stay here.
It just deflected over the dome.
Yes, of course.
Yes, and that gives me an idea. What are they doing now? They're packing it away.
How far down can this be aimed?
Can it be brought to bear on the surface of the moon?
Has it ever been tried?
With Evans gone, the gravitron is all yours.
What does that matter now?
Get someone to stand by that window and relay instructions direct to Benoit.
Start moving the probe down.
What? But it's way over their heads. There's one chance. We'll try bringing it down by hand.
Is this still switched off?
Round the back.
All your weight, once more. No, it's no use, it won't shift.
Why?
Polly!
We did it!
I'm so sorry we damaged it.
Possibly. And I hope it's the last we see of them.
There we are. In perfect flight.
Oh, that. What a lot of fuss. Just a bumpy landing, that's all. It won't happen again. I know.
Let's have a look at the time scanner.
The time scanner. Instead of the normal picture showing where we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future.
Oh nonsense. I haven't used it very much. It's (cough) not very reliable, as you can see.
Hmm?

That's better. Hello. But really, did you think I'd leave my best friend without a defence mechanism?
She's all right. She's fine, I promise. She'll just sleep.
You could be so wonderful.
You're a genius. You're stone cold brilliant, you are. I swear, you really are. But you could be so much more. You could be beautiful. With a mind like that, we could travel the stars. It would be my honour. Because you don't need to own the universe, just see it. To have the privilege of seeing the whole of time and space. That's ownership enough.
I can help.
I wonder what I'd be, without you.
It's a gap in the fabric of reality. You can see into the Time Vortex itself. And it hurts.
Then let's find it. You and me.
What? What is?
The Gate wasn't enough. You're still dying.
I said something is returning. I was shown a prophecy. That's why I need your help.
No. Just stop. Just think.
Actually, the most impressive thing about you is that after all this time, you're still bone dead stupid.
You've got six billion pairs of eyes, but you still can't see the obvious, can you?
That guard is one inch too tall.
That's cacti.
No, no, no. Get me out. No, no, no, don't. Don't! No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. The other way. I've got my Tardis.
No, no, no, just just listen to me!
Not the stairs. Not the stairs!
Worst rescue ever!
Just, just stop and listen to me!
No, no, no, no, don't!
Now get me out of this thing!
He's not going to let us go. Just hurry up and get me out!
Come on.
Oh, get a move on.
Come on!
Where's your flight deck?
And he's got every single missile on the planet ready to fire.
Yep.
We've got to close it down!
We're not leaving.
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
Just trying to fix the heating.
I'm sorry.
Isn't it?
I'm older than you.
I'm nine hundred and six.
Yeah.
I think you look like giants.
No.
No. You had that gun in the mansion. You could have shot the Master there and then.
I'd be proud.
If you were my dad.
Yeah.
And that's how the Master started. It's not like I'm an innocent. I've taken lives. I got worse. I got clever. Manipulated people into taking their own. Sometimes I think a Time Lord lives too long. I can't. I just can't.
I don't know.
The template snaps.
Never.
A Whitepoint star is only found on one planet. Gallifrey. Which means it's the Time Lords. The Time Lords are returning.
Inside the Time War. And the whole War was Timelocked. Like, sealed inside a bubble. It's not a bubble but just think of a bubble. Nothing can get in or get out of the Timelock. Don't you see? Nothing can get in or get out, except something that was already there.
If they can follow the signal, they can escape before they die.
There will be no party.
That's how I choose to remember them, the Time Lords of old. But then they went to war. An endless war, and it changed them right to the core. You've seen my enemies, Wilf. The Time Lords are more dangerous than any of them.
Right, yes, you. This is a salvage ship, yes? You go trawling the asteroid fields for junk?
So, you've got asteroid lasers!
Consider them unfrazzled. You there, what's your name? (Addams) I'm going to need you on navigation. (to Rossiter) And you, get in the laser-pod. Wilfred.
Laser number two. The old soldier's got one more battle.
Fix the heating?
Oh, yes!
There's an old Earth saying, Captain. A phrase of great power and wisdom, and consolation to the soul in times of need.
Allons-y!
Come on! Come on!
You two. What did I say? Lasers.
Because of the missiles. We've got to fight off an entire planet.
You two, open fire!
Open fire! Come on, Wilf!
Then get on the rear gun lasers! You two, open fire! Now!
No, you don't!
Come on! Fire!
Lock the navigation.
England. The Naismith mansion.
Destination?
Listen to me. You can't!
Oh, he's not saving you. Don't you realise what he's doing?
Something is returning. Don't you ever listen? That was the prophecy. Not someone, something.
They're not just bringing back the species. It's Gallifrey. Right here, right now.
Wilf, don't. Don't!
You weren't there in the final days of the War. You never saw what was born. But if the Timelock's broken, then everything's coming through. Not just the Daleks, but the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare Child, the Could-have-been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-weres. The War turned into hell. And that's what you've opened, right above the Earth. Hell is descending.
Just listen! Because even the Time Lords can't survive that.
You see now? That's what they were planning in the final days of the War. I had to stop them.
Get out of the way.
The link is broken. Back into the Time War, Rassilon. Back into hell.
I know.
I'm alive. I've. There was. I'm still alive.
Yeah.
The Master left the Nuclear Bolt running. It's gone into overload.
No, because all the excess radiation gets vented inside there. Vinvocci glass contains it. All five hundred thousand rads, about to flood that thing.
Except it's gone critical. Touch one control and it floods. Even this would set it off.
Sure.
Okay, right then, I will. Because you had to go in there, didn't you? You had to go and get stuck, oh yes. Because that's who you are, Wilfred. You were always this. Waiting for me all this time.
Well, exactly. Look at you. Not remotely important. But me? I could do so much more. So much more! But this is what I get. My reward. And it's not fair! Oh. Oh. I've lived too long.
Wilfred, it's my honour. Better be quick. Three, two, one.
Hi.
The system's dead. I absorbed it all. Whole thing's kaput. Oh. Now it opens, yeah.
It's started.
Oh, she's smiling. As if today wasn't bad enough. Anyway, don't go thinking this is goodbye, Wilf. I'll see you again, one more time.
Just keep looking. I'll be there.
To get my reward.
The Doctor.
Was she happy in the end?
I just wanted to give you this. Wedding present. Thing is, I never carry money, so I just popped back in time, borrowed a quid off a really lovely man. Geoffrey Noble, his name was. Have it, he said. Have that on me.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Yeah.
And you. What year is this?
2005. Tell you what. I bet you're going to have a really great year.
I don't want to go.
Legs. I've still got legs. Good. Arms. Hands. Ooo, fingers. Lots of fingers. Ears, yes. Eyes, two. Nose, I've had worse. Chin, blimey. Hair. I'm a girl! No. No. I'm not a girl. And still not ginger. And something else. Something important. I'm, I'm, I'm
Ha! Crashing!
Ha, ha! Whoo hoo hoo! Ah! Geronimo!

John Smith, Health and Safety.
Health and Safety. Film department.
(sotto) John Smith, Health and Safety. Don't mind me.
That's the printer there?
Brilliant.
Has it got paper?
Anyway, if you could print that off. Thanks.
Thanks, then. Oh, what's that?
What for?
Ah. Ah. But that contravenes er, paragraph five, subsection C. Sorry.
Me again.
Mister Roger Davey? I'm calling on behalf of Adipose Industries. Just need to ask you a few questions.
That's the same amount every day?
What makes you say that?
But with no burglars?
Tell me, Roger. Have you got a cat flap?
No, I've met cat people. You're nothing like them.
Well, thing about cat flaps is, they don't just let things in, they let things out as well.
The fat just walks away.
Well, thanks for your help. Tell you what, maybe you could lay off the pills for a week or so.
Oh. Got to go. Sorry.
Oh, fascinating. Seems to be a bio-flip digital stitch, specifically for
Donna?
But what? What? What?
But how?
Yes, I can see that.
What the hell are you doing there?
What for?
Run!
Yeah, thanks, Donna. Not right now.
Just like old times!
What do you mean, the bees are disappearing?
In you get!
Yes, in that thing.
No, no, no, because I've locked the controls with a sonic cage. I'm the only one that can control it. Not unless she's got a sonic device of her own, which is very unlikely.
Hold on. Hold on. We can get in through the window.
Can't get it open!
Donna!
Hold on!
I won't be a minute!
What are you, a journalist?
Well, make it up.
I've got you. I've got you. Stop kicking!
Oh, yes! And off we go.
Sorry!
Now do yourself a favour. Get out.
Nice to meet you, I'm the Doctor.
Oh, yes, I've still got your sonic pen. Nice. I like it. Sleek. It's kind of sleek.
Yeah, and if you were to sign your real name, that would be?
A wet nurse, using humans as surrogates.
What do you mean lost? How do you lose a planet?
Seeding a level five planet is against galactic law.
I'm trying to help you, Matron. This is your one chance, because if you don't call this off, then I'll have to stop you.
No, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. One more thing, before dying. Do you know what happens if you hold two identical sonic devices against each other?
Nor me. Let's find out.
I've been hacking into this thing all day, because the matron's got a computer core running through the centre of the building. Triple deadlocked. But now I've got this, (her sonic pen) I can get into it.
She's wired up the whole building. We need a bit of privacy.
Just enough to stop them. Why's she wired up the tower block? What's it all for?
Thanks.
Yup. Well, no. I had this friend. Martha she was called. Martha Jones. She was brilliant. And I destroyed half her life. But she's fine, she's good. She's gone.
Still lost. I thought you were going to travel the world?
What offer?
Come with me?
Right.
She's started the programme.
So far they're just losing weight, but the Matron's gone up to emergency pathogenesis.
Skeletons, organs, everything. A million people are going to die. Got to cancel the signal.
This contains a primary signal. If I can switch it off, the fat goes back to being just fat.
No, no, no, no, no. She's doubled it. I need. Haven't got time. It's too far. I can't override it. They're all gonna die!
Sorry, Donna, this is way beyond you. Got to double the base pulse, I can't.
I need a second capsule to boost the override, but I've only got the one. I can't save them
Nursery ship.
Hang on. Instructions from the Adiposian First Family.
She's wired up the tower block to convert it into a levitation post. Ooo. Oh. We're not the ones in trouble now. She is!
They're just children. They can't help where they come from.
She did, yeah. Yeah. She did. She fancied me.
Actually, as a diet plan, it sort of works. There she is!
Matron Cofelia, listen to me.
Oh, why does no one ever listen. I'm trying to help. Just get across to the roof. Can you shift the levitation beam?
Just listen. I saw the Adiposian instructions. They know it's a crime, breeding on Earth. So what's the one thing they want to get rid of? Their accomplice.
Exactly! Mum and Dad have got the kids now. They don't need the nanny anymore.
No.
You've got a, a hatbox.
No, it's just. It's a funny old life, in the Tardis.
I'm not saying that.
No. Actually, no. But the last time, with Martha, like I said, it, it got complicated. And that was all my fault. I just want a mate.
I just want a mate!
A mate. I want a mate.
There we are, then. Okay.
Yeah. Course you can, yeah. I'd love it.
What?
Here it is. The Tardis. It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.
So, whole wide universe, where do you want to go?
Which is?

I think this is not Hyde Park. Could be a nexial discontinuity. Must remember to overhaul those tracers. Put a knot in my hanky.
I wonder what that was for. Little look round, Doctor? Why not.
Hello. Hello, did I startle you? Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
Well, nobody's perfect, but that's overstating it a little. I'm the Doctor. What's your name?
Leela. A nice name, Leela. I never met anyone called Leela. Would you like a jelly baby?
You mustn't believe all they say. No, these are sweets. They're rather good. Go on, have one.
Go on.
Leela. Leela, either you've got four friends with very bad colds, or we're in danger. Which is it?
They are? I wonder if they know that. What are they like?
Ah.
Invisible. We've got a chance.
No, it's a clockwork egg timer. To our friends, whatever they are, the visible spectrum is irrelevant. They're blind. Crudely speaking, they home in on vibrations.
Now, Leela
Shush, shush, shush. I want you to do exactly as I say. You and I are going to walk away from here very slowly and very quietly. And no matter what happens, you mustn't cry out or make any sudden move. And above all, you mustn't run until I tell you. Is that clear?
Good. Now come on. Come on.
Freeze.
Shush!
Now tread carefully.
Saved by the bell. Come on. Come on.
How can you be sure?
I keep on telling you, I'm not the Evil One. Who was it saved your life?
Yes, thank you. Never cross the boundary? You know something? I'm sure those creatures don't stay on their side of the boundary out of a sense of fair play. There must be a fence of some kind.
Yes, a fence.
Got it. Low intensity sonic disrupter set in a hundred and eighty degree spread. Simple but effective.
Yes. It gives them a nasty headache if they go too close. They're probably set at intervals along the whole boundary.
The technology's quite advanced, so you didn't put them there.
Xoanon? What's those?
What, he's a god?
Really.
By whom?
Well, that sounds healthy anyway, Leela. Never be certain of anything. It's a sign of weakness. Now, where's this Xoanon held?
Is that just religious gobbledygook, or is that an actual place?
Is there. Will you show me?
What is it?
What?
I don't. Leela? Leela, where are you?
What? This is no time to be playing games.
You don't understand? If they're preparing for a battle, they're hardly likely to send men on patrol on the off-chance that you might come back.
On the other hand, I could be wrong about that.
Oh, absolutely. (sotto) Keep down, Leela, and get moving.
(sotto): Go away. (loud) That was either very good shooting or very bad. Either way, I wouldn't dream of moving.
I'm the Doctor. Who are you and why are you shooting at me?
Who?
Look, would you mind if I turned round? I feel a bit silly talking to this tree.
Oh dear, you too. Well then, tread softly, gentlemen, or I'll turn you into toads.
That gesture you did. Yes, that's the one. It's presumably to ward off evil. It's interesting because it's also the sequence for checking the seals on a Starfall Seven spacesuit. And what makes that particularly interesting is that you don't know what a Starfall Seven spacesuit is, do you.
Now drop your weapons, or I'll kill him with this deadly jelly baby.
What?
I don't take orders from anyone.
Take me to your leader.
Good evening. I think you're going to be very happy I came here tonight.
I'd be careful of that if I were you. It's an ultrabeam accelerator.
If there happens to be a charge in there, you could transform this whole village into a smoky hole in the ground.
Yes, well, look, if you'll just untie my hands, I think I have an idea of what's going on. I may be able to help.
Oh no, I can see you're a person of very superior intellect. (to Andor) Are you the leader of this tribe, or his he?
Well, gladly, if I was holding him prisoner, but I'm not.
Eh?
Don't hurry on my account.
Andor, listen to me.
Andor, please listen to me. I am not the Evil One. I am a traveller, that's all. Your tribe has obviously been visited by travellers before.
They're space travellers, Andor. Men from another world. The whole place is littered with their equipment, their weapons and tools. Your legend of a captive god is obviously related to them in some way.
Andor, please think about what
Andor.
Andor, killing me isn't going to help you. It isn't going to do me much good either, is it.
How did you do that?
What?
No, listen. Listen.
Do you know this litany?
Good. Then let's go, and don't dawdle.
That wasn't necessary. Who licensed you to slaughter people? No more Janis thorns, you understand? Ever.
This way.
What?
Well now, it seems I have been here before.
Is it.
I must have made quite an impression.
Well, of course I can remember. I'm trying to. Perhaps I was on another part of the planet.
Beyond the Wall. I wonder.
Shush, shush, shush. I'm wondering. Back to the village.
Why not?
Not if they don't catch us, we won't. Anyway, they'll be preparing for their battle.
Well, you can't expect perfection, you know. Not even from me.
(sotto) I must examine those relics.
I like the hat. Very fetching.
That was an armoured space glove, or what was left of one.
It's all clear.
Amazing. You know, I had a feeling, I had a feeling that Neeva was actually expecting to hear an answer to his prayer.
I could quote you a few theologians who'd give you an argument on that. He was listening.
Hello? Intergalactic Operator? Hello? Over? Dead as a Dalek. There must be something.
I thought I recognised it.
Poor old Neeva. Hotline to god. Psst. Don't be afraid. It's only a machine for sending voices over long distances. That may be Xoanon speaking, but it's not God. Gods don't use transceivers.
Aren't you?
That's better.
I'm sorry, Neeva isn't here at the moment. Could I take a message? Over.
Us?
Who are you?
Leela, I have a feeling. Something nasty. Something I did. It seems like it.
Who did that voice remind you of?
More to the point, who could that be? I must take a look at the Wall.
It's a time barrier.
The principle's really quite simple. You just move everything forward a couple of seconds inside it. You get a barrier that's impervious to all energy. A true void. I've seen it done as a parlour trick, but never on this scale.
Not unless whoever set it up deliberately bridged it.
Are walking into a trap, yes.
It's too late. Anyway, they wouldn't listen.
Hello, Caleb. I was just thinking about you.
I wouldn't be surprised.
How was the battle?
Leela, put the knife away. I'm sure he's a reasonable man.
Leela seems to think it might be yours.
Having first of all, of course, convinced you.
I'm impressed. Perhaps Leela's right about you.
There isn't much time. You see, Leela and I found an impenetrable barrier
I thought you were too easily convinced.
She underestimated your ambition.
Of course. This too.
You need me alive, remember?
Come in. Who are you?
He poisoned her with a Janis thorn. Up!
I'll break your nose if you don't get up. Now pick her up, both of you.
What, at this range? No, all it needs is a flick of the wrist. Pick her up.
And move.
Gently.
Tomas, you don't want her to die, do you?
Then cover him. I need time to work.
This is a bioanalyser, rattlesnake. I can identify the poison and programme the medikit to make an antitoxin.
Shut up, rattlesnake. I'm trying to save time. Leela hasn't got much left.
Got it!
Watch the door.
Are you all right?
Yes, there is. Just a matter of finding one.
Yes. Well, no, no. Answers are easy. It's asking the right questions that is hard.
Can you move?
Tomas, take her out of the back way.
You're going with Tomas. I'll meet you both later. Go.
Good evening, gentlemen. You know, I never thought you'd get here. Good heavens, look at that.
Now then, down to business. I'm beginning to think you don't like me. Ah, Neeva. Is it really you? They told me you were dead. Or was it the other way round?
Ha! If you can believe that, you can believe anything. I'll tell you once again. I am not the Evil One.
Oh, flapdoodle! I was nowhere near it.
The attack failed because it was a trap from the start.
What do you mean, throw them? What is a Horda, anyway?
No, politics. He's trying to break Neeva's hold on the tribe.
Good point. Fifteen love.
Fifteen all.
Game, set and match to Caleb, I think.
So that's a Horda. Well, it doesn't look to formidable. What do I do, fight it or eat it?
I take it there are more than ten in there.
Ah.
And then what?
What? The rope gets thinner the further it goes
But it gets faster too. The rope gets thinner the further it goes
Who is that man?
That man.
Sorry about that. Shall we get on with it?
Well?
Very good, Doctor. Very good. Well, are you convinced now? Leela, that was very nice of you to try and help me, but really there was absolutely no need. Would you just release our friend, please?
Shoot like what? Oh, like that. In Switzerland. Charming man. William Tell, he was called. Well?
Good.
Yes, I'm here, Xoanon.
I see, Xoanon. Why don't we get together and talk things over?
Now we don't want to do anything hasty, do we?
It means trouble. Large, deadly and invisible.
Screwdriver.
Good. Did you explain about their attraction to vibrations?
You know, we're very lucky they carried these things. Let's hope we can profit from the misfortunes of those travellers.
I mean the planetary survey teams. That's where your tribe got its name from. Sevateem, survey team. The question is, were you here before them?
You catch on quickly. Certainly they never returned to base.
Why, are you taking charge here?
Tomas, take this.
You just point it and press it. It's destructive up to about twenty times bow range. Short bursts, Tomas. It's self-regenerating but it takes time to recharge.
There. That should keep Xoanon's creatures on their side of the perimeter. Now, you and I have got to get inside that time barrier and soon.
I could build a time bridge myself, but that would mean dismantling the Tardis and then it mightn't work.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Well, it's quite simple. We. You're a genius. A genius.
Come on, Neeva. Neeva! Come on, snap out of it, man.
Neeva.
Neeva, when you hear the voice of Xoanon, is it when you're at the altar, or when the vestment is hanging in its frame?
Have you heard it anywhere else?
Where?
Neeva! Neeva! This is Xoanon.
Where have you heard my voice?
You've been a good and faithful servant, Neeva. Go back to sleep now.
It is a tight beam transmission. There's a bridge over the time barrier and I know where it is.
Too much too quickly.
This time I have to admit defeat.
(sotto) Shush. Xoanon.
They must have panicked.
Yes. Come on, we haven't got much time.
The nose could be a shade more aquiline, and the noble proportion of the brow hasn't been perfectly executed. Still, we mustn't complain. We live in an imperfect universe.
No, it isn't! Up the nose. It's over the teeth and down the throat.
Odd feeling.
Standing in my own throat is.
There's only one way to find out.
I remember now. The Mordee expedition. And I thought I was helping them.
Tesh? How did you know it was a Tesh? Have you ever seen a Tesh?
That was a protective suit and helmet. Must be another environment through there.
Come on then.
It's an illusion, called a psy-tri projection. Combination of a three dimensional image which acts on the eye. Close your eyes.
Both of them. Take one step back.
Now walk forward.
It's called an anti-grav transporter. Just sit in it and it takes us straight to the ship in absolutely no time at all.
Another shrine. Seems the Tesh are as ignorant of their origins as your people are.
How does the litany go? That bit about Paradise. Leela, you said you knew it. You said you were taught it as children.
Slowly, slowly.
Yes, exactly. That means the Sevateem explored the planet, while the Tesh remained to work in the ship in the place where it landed. Here.
Yes, the Sevateem were the survey teams and the Tesh were the technicians. You're all human beings from this colony ship.
I'm rather afraid I did. I misunderstood what Xoanon was.
At the time, I didn't think he was a being at all. These terminals are dead.
Hello!
Are you doing that? Will you please stop doing that? I said stop!
What have you done to her?
But where are they taking her?
Have you dropped something?
Yes, well, I'm very grateful about the honour, but it's really information I need. Please get up. What's your name?
Ah.
Jabel, do your people have a holy purpose?
Ah. Well, it has a sort of logic. Outside the barrier, physical courage and strength, inside the barrier, paraphysical achievement and the sort of psi power you used against Leela. It's an experiment in eugenics.
Shall we get up? The floor's very hard. Didn't anyone ever tell you kneeling stunts the growth? Jabel, do you know where Xoanon is?
Where?
All right, I didn't think you did.
Do you know what a computer is?
Do you know what a computer is?
Now I have to find that thing before it kills us all.
This whole control room's been disconnected, Jabel. It could take me days to find the complex.
I must be slipping. Jabel, where's the Holy of Holies?
But there must be somewhere on the ship?
Yes. Somewhere where no one's allowed to go.
Yes. Where is it?
Jabel, thank you. I
Jabel. Jabel, that's Leela.
Particle analysis?
It will kill her.
What? That's not a good enough reason!
The savages don't open the barrier, you lack-brain! Xoanon does. Do you understand that? Xoanon does!
Give the order to stop that particle analyser.
Will you give that order?
Right, then I'll do it myself.
Close your eyes.
Be thankful you're living, and trust to your luck, and march to your front like a soldier. Gertrude Stein
To be strictly accurate, it broke itself. All I did was reflect some of the power back into it. Still, I don't suppose its owners will see it that way. Come on, we'd better go.
Looking for something.
Oh, probably, probably.
A machine that's become a living creature. An old mission computer with schizophrenia. Not a very pretty thought, is it. Not my fault.
When I was here before, I programmed Xoanon for the Mordee. Unfortunately I forgot to wipe my personality print from the data core. Or did I really forget? I forget if I forgot.
It may have been my own egotism. Anyway, now it has a split personality and half of it is mine. Is that clear?
Well, come on, then.
Shut the door.
An auxiliary communications room.
Ah.
Looks like it. They're psi-tri projections from the dark side of Xoanon's id with enough kinetic energy to kill. Looks as if your friends are running out of time.
Don't be absurd. What do you think you can do about it? If I can arrange it, they'll be safer inside the barrier.
I didn't say safe, I said safer.
Neeva? Neeva? Neeva, are you there? Come on, wake up!
Neeva, this is Xoanon.
Tell Caleb to lead the tribe through the mouth of the idol.
That is my order. See that it is done.
Say these words to him. I don't believe in ghosts either.
Go now, and do my will.
I underestimated that man. Come on, we've got an appointment on level thirty seven.
(silent) Hold that.
Keep watch.
Xoanon's unstable. He might kill me. He'd certainly kill you. Anyway, we need someone on guard.
I'm the Doctor. I'm the Doctor!
I'm the Doctor.
I'm the Doctor!
To correct a mistake I made when I was here before.
I made the mistake.
I made the mistake! When the ship was stranded, the computer broke down. I thought the data core had been damaged, so I renewed it by making a direct link with the compatible centres of my own brain.
A variation of it, yes.
This isn't a fairy tale. It actually happened.
For generations, teams of technicians had worked on the computer, trying to extend its power.
No. No. Without realising it, they had created life. The computer hadn't failed at all. It had evolved into a living creature, the first of an entirely new species.
Yes, a new species. When I arrived, it had just been born. It was in shock. I didn't recognise a birth trauma and that was my mistake. And when I connected my own brain to it, it didn't just take compatible information as a machine should have done. It took everything.
When it woke, it had a complete personality. Mine. It thought I was itself. Then it began to develop another separate self, its own self. And that's when it started to go mad.
It's here, Xoanon! I'm talking to it! It's you!
Xoanon? Xoanon?
No, no, wait, Xoanon. I'm the Doctor. I'm separate, I'm real. You must acknowledge me.
And I am the Doctor.
I'm the Doctor!
I am the Doctor!
Leela, are you all right?
Yes, part of him. It's just a question, really. Everything beyond that door is Xoanon. You were inside him. The most powerful computer ever built.
He's insane.
His first impulse will be to kill me. It'll be more important to him than anything else.
Yes, because I contradict what he thinks is real. I'm a threat to his world. Red lighting, and the smell. A sort of smell of a smell.
Don't touch that!
Xoanon must have shorted the electrical power circuits in the wall.
Yes, a precaution in case I got out. As traps go, a bit haphazard. Why not electrify the floor? I would have expected something more positive.
This isn't necessary. I've got a wonderful idea.
Why didn't you listen?
Yes. Xoanon's just warming up. Come on. When he gets desperate enough he'll destroy everything to get at us.
Ah, these could be useful. You know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common.
They don't alter their views to fit the facts. They alter the facts to fit their views, which can be uncomfortable
If you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering.
Leela, that gun is getting heavy. It's getting heavy. Heavy.
Now then, when I count three, you'll wake up. One, two, three. Shall we go?
Something the matter?
Oh, you're just probably tired, that's all. Can you still remember the way to the main control room?
Come on then. You lead on.
Ha! You'll have to be quicker than that, you overblown adding machine.
Sensory links everywhere? That's impossible.
He'd be able to measure every change in temperature, vibration, pressure.
Yes, and very charming he is too when he wants to be. Marvellous host. I remember once at one of his dinner parties
So? We know exactly where he is. Fair does. You wouldn't want an unfair advantage, would you?
(sotto) I thought you'd say that.
Ah.
Now we can see, too.
They watch and control various parts of the ship, make sure everything's working properly.
Atomic generators.
Well, I'll explain it all
Flashing? He's put the atomic generators on overload. He got desperate sooner than I thought.
Well, it means I've got about twenty four and a half minutes to build a reverse memory transfer system and wipe my personality print from its brain.
If I can't do it, the atomic generators will explode, taking Xoanon, us and half the planet with them. Effective, but crude.
You'll be all right.
Xoanon, you'll destroy yourself as well as us!
Now, Xoanon.
Hello.
Ow. I wish I hadn't.
Yes. How long have I been out?
Two days. Two days? I haven't got time to be lying around here for two days!
Don't you listen?
No, I don't suppose you do. I removed, I hope I removed half of Xoanon's dual personality. How is he?
What?
And what do you call it?
That's better.
Give me a chocolate. I think I'll go and see Xoanon.
Perhaps. Perhaps.
Ah, so that's why Xoanon lost his hold on Tomas and the rest. I wonder who it was?
Well, if he was psychotic he'd be impossible to control. Perhaps Xoanon will tell us. Anyone at home?
How do you feel?
Oh, I'm fine now, thanks. Can't complain.
But you told yourself you were breeding a race of superhumans.
Hostility and conflict to speed up the process until you were ready to select the best of both.
Yes, it is horrible. Isn't it horrible?
Oh, well, it was the least I could do in the circumstances. After all, I did start the trouble in the first place.
I don't think anyone could have made it.
Well now, isn't this nice.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen. Democracy at work, I see.
He said he's extremely sorry about all the trouble that he's caused, that he has great power and knowledge and he puts it all at your disposal.
He offers you this as a token of his good faith.
Press it, and he'll cease to exist.
Well, there's one way to find out.
No? Little Gentek? Good.
You've got to trust someone sometime.
Ah. But that's not my problem.
Leela. What are you doing here?
You don't need that, Leela. The phantoms were merely projections of Xoanon's disturbed subconscious. He's better now.
Invariably. Invariably. Goodbye.
Why?
Well, yes, I suppose I do like you. But then, I like lots of people but I can't go carting them around the universe with me. Goodbye.
Come out of there. Out.
Come out! Don't touch that! Don't touch

The control's not working.
I don't know where we're going, but my old hand's very excited about it.
Well.
Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely.
Why would the Tardis bring us here, then?
We're unarmed. Look, no weapons. Never any weapons. We're safe.
Oi, oi. What's wrong with clean hands?
Something tells me this isn't about to check my blood pressure. Argh!
It's taken a tissue sample. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. And extrapolated it. Some kind of accelerator?
What on earth? That's just
From me.
Well, she's, well, she's my daughter.
Mmm. Technically.
Progenation. Reproduction from a single organism. Means one parent is biological mother and father. You take a sample of diploid cells, split them into haploids, then recombine them in a different arrangement and grow. Very quickly, apparently.
I'm not detonating anything.
Martha! No. Don't.
You've sealed off the tunnel. Why did you do that?
But they've got my friend.
I'm going to find her.
The machine must embed military history and tactics, but no name. She's a generated anomaly.
Good as anything, I suppose.
They stole a tissue sample at gunpoint and processed it. It's not what I call natural parenting.
You can't extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident.
Look, just because I share certain physiological traits with simian primates doesn't make me a monkey's uncle, does it?
So, where are we? What planet's this?
Maybe they're doing Miss Saigon.
General Cobb, I presume.
Eastern zone, that's us, yeah. Yeah. I'm The Doctor, this is Donna.
Well, that's all right. I can't stay, anyway. I've got to go and find my friend.
Yes, I noticed. With the Hath. But tell me, because we got a bit out of circulation, eastern zone and all that. So who exactly are the Hath?
So what happened?
How long's this war gone on for?
Does this show the entire city, including the Hath zones?
Well, it'll help us find Martha.
Ooo, the Source. What's that, then? What's a Source? I like a Source. What is it?
And that would be?
Right. So it's a creation myth.
Ah! I thought so. There's a suppressed layer of information in this map. If I can just
See? A whole complex of tunnels hidden from sight.
Er, call me old-fashioned, but if you really wanted peace, couldn't you just stop fighting?
Hang on, hang on. A second ago it was peace in our time. Now you're talking about genocide.
Then you need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up genocide. You'll see a little picture of me there, and the caption will read, over my dead body.
No, we're, we're not a couple.
I'm going to stop you, Cobb. You need to know that.
This.
Makes as much sense as the Breath of Life story.
Yes, but there could still be something real in that temple. Something that's become a myth. A piece of technology, a weapon.
Oh, yes.
That's why we need to get out of here, find Martha and stop Cobb from slaughtering the Hath. What, what are you, what are you, what are you staring at?
No, no. I'm trying to stop the fighting.
Well, I suppose, but that's, that's. Technically, I haven't got time for this. Donna, give me your phone. Time for an upgrade.
It's not a weapon.
Donna, will you tell her?
Martha, you're alive!
I'm with Donna. We're fine. What about you?
Yes, all right. And, and Jenny. That's the woman from the machine. The soldier. My daughter, except she isn't, she's, she's. Anyway. where are you?
Oh, that was me. If both armies are heading that way, there's going to be a bloodbath.
Just stay where you are.
If you're safe there, don't move, do you hear?
They're getting ready to move out. We have to get past that guard.
No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere.
You belong here with them.
She's a soldier. She came out of that machine.
Two hearts.
It's who I am. It's where I'm from.
You're an echo, that's all. A Time Lord is so much more. A sum of knowledge, a code, a shared history, a shared suffering. Only it's gone now, all of it. Gone forever.
There was a war.
Bigger. Much bigger.
Yes.
That's the way out.
Don't you dare.
Let's save your wiles for later. In case of emergency.
I was going to distract him, not clobber him.
They must all have a copy of that new map. Just stay there. Don't hurt anyone.
Wait. This is it. The hidden tunnel. There must be a control panel.
The original builders must have left them. Some old cataloguing system.
I told you. I'm the Doctor.
No.
Here it is.
For? They're not, they're not for anything.
I travel through time and space.
Got it!
Now, what were you saying about running?
Arming device.
Right, here we go.
Where are you going?
No, we don't need any more dead.
It doesn't mean you have to kill them.
Listen to me. The killing. After a while, it infects you. And once it does, you're never rid of it.
We always have a choice.
Jenny.
I told you. Nothing but a soldier.
Jenny, come on.
Jenny, leave it! Let's go.
Jenny, come on. That's it.
No, no, no, no, no, no. The circuit's looped back.
The controls are back there.
Wait. Just. There isn't. Jenny, I can't
Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely. Brilliant! You were brilliant. Brilliant.
I warned you, Cobb. If the Source is a weapon, I'm going to make sure you never use it.
Hmm?
I suppose so.
Well, we can't leave you here, can we?
Careful, there might be traps.
Dad-shock?
No, it's not that.
Donna, I've been a father before.
I lost all that a long time ago, along with everything else.
I know. I'm just. When I look at her now, I can see them. The hole they left, all the pain that filled it. I just don't know if I can face that every day.
But when they died, that part of me died with them. It'll never come back. Not now.
Love the running.
Can't be. This must be the Temple. This is a door.
I've got it!
Nearly done.
Then get back here.
Now! Got it.
No fun otherwise.
Fusion drive transport. It's a spaceship.
Well, it could be, but the power cells would have run down after all that time. This one's still powered-up and functioning. Come on.
Look, look, look, look, look. Ship's log.
(reads) First wave of Human/Hath co-colonisation of planet Messaline.
Phase one, construction. They used robot drones to build the city.
Final entry. (reads) Mission commander dead. Still no agreement on who should assume leadership. Hath and humans have divided into factions. That must be it. A power vacuum. The crew divided into two factions and turned on each other. Start using the progenation machines, suddenly you've got two armies fighting a never-ending war.
It's like the numbers in the tunnels.
Oh! It's the New Byzantine Calendar.
Yes. Oh, good work, Donna.
Oh seven twenty four. No.
Seven days.
Just seven days.
Seven days since war broke out.
They could have twenty generations in a day. Each generation gets killed in the war, passes on the legend. Oh, Donna, you're a genius.
No, they're not ruined. They're just empty. Waiting to be populated. Oh, they've mythologised their entire history. The Source must be part of that too. Come on.
Martha! Oh, I should have known you wouldn't stay away from the excitement.
That's the General. We haven't got much time.
Yes. Bougainvillea. I say we follow our nose.
Oh, yes. Yes. Isn't this brilliant?
Terraforming. It's a third generation terraforming device.
Because that's what it does. All this, only bigger. Much bigger. It's in a transit state. Producing all this must help keep it stable before they finally
Stop! Hold your fire!
You said you wanted this war over.
You can't win. No one can. You don't even know why you're here. Your whole history, it's just Chinese whispers, getting more distorted the more it's passed on. This is the Source. This is what you're fighting over. A device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem. It's nothing mystical. It's from a laboratory, not some creator. It's a bubble of gases. A cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution. Methane, hydrogen, ammonia, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids. It's used to make barren planets habitable. Look around you. It's not for killing, it's bringing life. If you allow it, it can lift you out of these dark tunnels and into the bright, bright sunlight. No more fighting, no more killing.
I'm the Doctor, and I declare this war is over.
The gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process.
It means a new world.
Jenny? Jenny. Talk to me, Jenny.
Jenny, be strong now. You need to hold on, do you hear me? We've got things to do, you and me, hey? Hey? We can go anywhere. Everywhere. You choose.
You're my daughter, and we've only just got started. You're going to be great. You're going to be more than great. You're going to be amazing. You hear me? Jenny?
Two hearts. Two hearts. She's like me. If we wait. If we just wait.
No. Too much. That's the truth of it. She was too much like me.
I never would. Have you got that? I never would. When you start this new world, this world of Human and Hath, remember that. Make the foundation of this society a man who never would.
Jenny was the reason for the Tardis bringing us here. It just got here too soon, which then created Jenny in the first place. Paradox. An endless paradox. Time to go home?
We're making a habit of this.
Oh there's always something worth living for, Martha.
Goodbye. Doctor Jones.

Yes, I think I can say that I know just exactly where we are.
In the future. Very much in the future. We've now reached the distant horizon of an age, an age of peace and prosperity. Now, I'm going to be off.
Yes, it's just as I thought. Yes. Yes, well I think my young friends are in for quite a surprise.
Oh, dear me, what was that now? Well, I shan't be long anyway.
That ridiculous young man. He thought I'd made a mistake.
Hello, there. I say, come out from underneath there. Now don't be alarmed. Come along now.
Can you hear me? Oh, I say, do come out from underneath there, will you?
Oh, good gracious me. You know, I thought for one moment you were hiding behind those bushes.
Oh, yes, I see. Well, I am expected. Do you know who I am?
Oh, and what might that be?
I see. And how would you expect me here and now?
I see. Yes, well, that's very clever of them.
Oh yes, they're quite right, yes, I never do. No, this is my RV, you see. This is my Reacting Vibrator. I'm able to do my calculations from this. As I told my young friends
Good gracious, no. Did you expect me to be?
Oh, they're very pleasant. Yes, they're both very pleasant apart from their juvenile exuberances. I'm sure you'll like them. They must be at the back here somewhere. I think they're rather worried because I'm a bit late joining them.
Must?
Oh yes, of course, yes, yes, yes, I shall come with you. In the meantime, young man, I wonder if you'd mind trying to find my young people for me. Steven and Dodo. Tell them the Doctor sent you.
Well, that's very kind of you to make me feel so welcome.
Well, my dear sir, that's very good of you. Yes, yes, very good of you indeed. Yes, I don't remember being so highly honoured before like this anywhere I've been.
Oh, come, come, my dear sir. I know that you've been very responsible for vast scientific research. And at the same time, I always knew a race existed of great intelligence in this segment of the universe.
You have, you have. Indeed, you have. And if I may so say, thank you dear ladies for making me appear so grand.
Ah, there you are, both of you. Well, I don't think I was so far wrong, my boy. What do I look like, my dear?
Yes. With what, my dear?
Yes, and I was right. They are very highly developed civilised minds.
Oh yes, thank you.
An excellent idea, sir. Well, my boy, now perhaps you'll believe me next time I tell you I know precisely where I am.
Well, gentlemen, I can't just sit here in all these grand clothes without asking a few questions. After all, there's my reputation to think about.
Well, if I accept your gifts, I must endorse your life. But I can't do that without knowing something about you.
Yes, I know very well that you are far advanced than most planets. But how you achieve this, I know not. And let's face it gentlemen, you are much advanced. Now, I would like to know how.
Oh, yes, it's quite obvious to the meanest intellect that, well, how can I say, that you've found a much more effective source of energy.
To a member of your community.
Yes. Of course, you need a very high form of life to make this source effective.
My dear Steven, you must not come bursting into the room like this. Well?
Gone? What do you mean, gone?
Well, I really don't know what all this fuss is about. I'm sure the child won't come to any harm while she here.
If I know that young lady, she's well enough to look after herself. Now, come along, please let's finish the conversation.
Tut, tut, tut.
A very interesting discussion, gentlemen. Yes, I must say.
Oh, so there you are, my dear. You know you had that young man in quite a state.
Not for the moment, my dear.
Do you my boy? Well, I'm afraid I can't just now. I've had a very interesting discussion with these gentlemen. You know, I have some documents which I think that you might be interested to see. They're records of my investigations into time travel. You might find them rather surprising.
Yes, just for the moment. But I won't be long.
Oh, splendid, my boy. Thank you. I need someone to help me carry a few things.
No, no, thank you, that won't be necessary. Thank you, indeed. Well, come along, my dear. We don't want to lose you again, do we? (The Doctor, Steven and Dodo leave.)
Ah, now. Wait a minute, let me see, where are we?
Because I didn't want those gentlemen to overhear what you were saying, child.
Precisely.
Not altogether.
Nothing really, but I sense that things aren't all together right here. Now I think we go this way, isn't it? Come along.
What?
Really? But he's not moving. Yes, yes, let's take a look. Hold that. Here.
Was he in this condition when you met him before?
Did he come out of that laboratory?
Yes, yes, yes, I think I do, yes. It's just as I feared.
Yes, their wonderful civilisation is based on this. They've discovered a way of extracting life's force from human beings, and absorbing it into themselves, leaving the victim, as you see, almost dead.
Here's the key to the Tardis, my boy. Now I want you to go to the emergency cabinet and you will see a container with capsules marked D403. Bring it back here as soon as you can. I think we might be able to do something for the poor man.
Meanwhile, take that, I don't want it anymore.
Now, now, now, now you just rest there, there's a good fellow. We'll have you as right as rain in five minutes. Now I just want you to breathe in and out. Gently. One, two. One
What do you know of this?
What are you doing, fellow? Leave the man alone. He'll probably die.
I insist that you leave him alone!
I think I understand only too well.
This human being!
They are men. Human beings, like you and me. Although it appears at the moment that you're behaving in a rather sub-human fashion.
I forbid you to touch him!
I am looking after this wretched fellow.
I have already told you I'm busy. I'm going to take care of this poor man.
Hmm?
So your rewards are only for the people that agree with you?
Oppose you? Indeed I am going to oppose you, just in the same way that I oppose the Daleks or any other menace to common humanity.
Human progress, sir? How dare you call your treatment of these people progress!
I fail to see the difference.
Exploitation indeed! This, sir, is protracted murder!
The sacrifice of even one soul is far too great! You must put an end to this inhuman practice.
So this is the place where you carry out your foul experiments.
Thank you. What's this?
Oh, yes, yes, interested, yes. Although I disapprove of your activities.
No, gentlemen, no, gentlemen. I don't wish to bear witness.
I should hope not, my boy.
What did you say?
I think you have forgotten one thing, gentlemen.
My feelings in this matter! I will not submit to your nauseating experiments! I am going out of that door, so don't try to stop me.
Let me pass.
Not at Jano.
You must not harm Jano.
Please carry out my instructions, and do not harm Jano.
Yes, I think so, my dear. I must have fallen into some kind of a coma. It was as though, as though all my powers were being sapped.
Where am I? Where am I?
No. No, my dear, no, no, we can't leave yet. No, we've got a lot of work to do.
Yes, yes, I don't intend to leave these people in this oppressed state.
Yes, you're probably right, my boy. I shan't even try.
I am going to destroy the power that they hold over you.
Yes, precisely.
All we need is one friend from the other side.
I think we have him already, my dear.
All of them?
Yes, I think you will find they've left one behind.
Yes, well, there's no need to, my boy.
That is correct. We'll wait until it's dark, and then I think we shall have a visitor.
There's no need for that, my boy.
Shush, shush, shush, shush.
Yes, I am here, Jano. We were expecting you.
Tell your people they are quite safe, Chal. Jano comes as a friend.
Oh, my dear Jano, it wasn't difficult. I knew you were to undergo the in-transference yourself.
Yes, an unknown experiment. And you're not the type of man to allow others to take risks.
It's all very simple. You wanted my intellect. You got it, and along with it, you received a little conscience.
Yes, yes. You see, Jano is now saddled with the sense of right and wrong, which makes him an explosive element in a civilisation such as his.
Jano has another plan.
I think it's like mine.
We must take that chance.
You know, my dear, there's something very satisfying in destroying something that's evil, don't you think?
Jano, since you have destroyed the power you held over Chal and his people, you realise now of course, you've got to learn to live together.
I see. But in my case I'm afraid that is utterly impossible.
A great honour, dear boy.
Just think of the challenge to be able to set up the people of this planet for a new life. You're quite ready for this task.
Yes, I do. And you're the only man who can, my boy.
Thank you, Jano. And if ever you need the benefit of my wisdom again, I trust and hope you will allow me to express myself with my own free will, rather than place me in an oven, and try and cook it out of me.
Well, I must say, young man, I'm very proud of you.
I know, I know, my boy. Well, go on, you mustn't keep them waiting.
Goodbye, Steven, and good luck.
Well, who knows, my dear. In this strange complex of time and space, anything can happen. Come along, little one. We must go. We mustn't look back.

Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's not the end of the world. Well, it is the end of the world. Actually, it's the end of the universe. Oh, no. Hang on.
You need to get me out of the Pandorica.
Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then. Well, back now from your point of view, which is back then from my point of view. Time travel, you can't keep it straight in your head. It's easy to open from the outside. Just point and press.
Now go.
Oh, and when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her top pocket. Good luck.
How did you do that?
No, I didn't.
Temporal energy. Same screwdriver at different points in its own time stream. Which means it was me who gave it to you. Me from the future. I've got a future. That's nice. That's not.
History has collapsed. Whole races have been deleted from existence. These are just like after-images. Echoes. Fossils in time. The footprints of the never-were.
Total event collapse. The universe literally never happened.
Nothing. Eye of the storm, that's all. We're just the last light to go out. Amy. Where's Amy?
Oh, Rory.
You're a Nestene duplicate. A lump of plastic with delusions of humanity.
That's software talking.
Yeah, probably, if I had the time.
All of creation has just been wiped from the sky. Do you know how many lives now never happened? All the people who never lived? Your girlfriend isn't more important than the whole universe.
Welcome back, Rory Williams! Sorry. Had to be sure. Hell of a gun-arm you're packing there. Right, we need to get her downstairs. And take that look off your plastic face. You're getting married in the morning.
Bit of a plan, yeah. Memories are more powerful than you think, and Amy Pond is not an ordinary girl. Grew up with a time crack in her wall. The universe pouring through her dreams every night. The Nestenes took a memory print of her and got a bit more than they bargained for, like you. Not just your face, but your heart and your soul.
I'm leaving her a message for when she wakes up, so she knows what's happening.
I'm saving her. This box is the ultimate prison. You can't even escape by dying. It forces you to stay alive.
Well, she's mostly dead. The Pandorica can stasis-lock her that way. Now, all it needs is a scan of her living DNA and it'll restore her.
In about two thousand years.
He's in here. Left a message in my head like I'm an answerphone. Where am I? Hang on. National Museum, right? I was here once when I was a little
Yeah, but we're taking a shortcut. River's vortex manipulator. Rubbish way to time travel, but the universe is tiny now. We'll be fine.
A version of it. Not quite the one you know. Earth alone in the sky. Let's go and have a look. You put your hand there. Don't worry. Should be safe.
She'll be fine. Nothing can get into this box.
Well, there's only one of me. I counted.
No. Rory, no. Don't even think about it.
She won't feel it.
Two thousand years, Rory. You won't even sleep. you'd be conscious every second. It would drive you mad.
Rory, you
Yes. Obviously.
Why do you have to be so human?
Listen to me. This is the last bit of advice you're going to get in a very long time. You're living plastic, but you're not immortal. I have no idea how long you'll last. And you're not indestructible. Stay away from heat and radio signals when they come along. You can't heal, or repair yourself. Any damage is permanent. So, for God's sake, however bored you get, stay out of
Trouble. Oh. Ah, two of you. Complicated.
Come along, Ponds.
Well, we are running into a dead end, where I'll have a brilliant plan, that basically involves not being in one.
Get out of here. Go! Just run!
It's not a weapon. Scan it. It's not a weapon, and you don't have the power to waste.
Yeah, shut up, because we've got to go. Come on.
And break. And breathe. Well, somebody didn't get out much for two thousand years.
Oh, it's all mouths today, isn't it. The light. The light from the Pandorica, it must have hit the Dalek.
Out! Out! Out!
So, two thousand years. How did you do?
Oh. How?
Ah. Well, no time to lose, then.
Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's not the end of the world.
Oops, sorry.
You need to get me out of the Pandorica.
Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then.
Right, let's go then. Wait! Now I don't have the sonic. I just gave it Rory two thousand years ago.
And when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her top pocket.
Right then.
Off we go! No, hang on. How did you know to come here?
Ah, my handwriting. Okay.
There you go. Drink up.
Vortex manipulator. Cheap and nasty time travel. Very bad for you. I'm trying to give it up.
The roof.
Yeah, it's me. Me from the future.
What? Dead? Yes, yes. Of course he's dead. Right, I've got twelve minutes. That's good.
Oh, you can do loads in twelve minutes. Suck a mint, buy a sledge, have a fast bath. Come on, the roof.
Oh, good. Are you in charge now? So tell me, what are we going to do about Amelia?
There is no Amelia. From now on, there never was. History is still collapsing.
You're an anomaly. We all are. We're all just hanging on at the eye of the storm. But the eye is closing, and if we don't do something fast, reality will never have happened. Today, just dying is a result. Now, come on!
Move it! Come on!
History is shrinking. Is anybody listening to me? The universe is collapsing. We don't have much time left.
Looking for the Tardis.
Okay then, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.
Good question for another day. The question for now is, total event collapse means that every star in the universe never happened. Not one single one of them ever shone. So, if all the stars that ever were are gone, then what is that?
Like I said, I'm looking for an exploding Tardis.
Is it? Well, here's the noise that sun is making right now.
That's my Tardis burning up. That's what's been keeping the Earth warm.
No, it's not. Of course, the emergency protocols. The Tardis has sealed off the control room and put her into a time loop to save her. She is right at the heart of the explosion.
Hi, honey. I'm home.
It's okay, he's on our side.
Yeah.
It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
Oh!
Run, run! Move, move. Go!
Shush. It's moving away, finding another way in. It needs to restore its power before it can attack again. Now, that means we've got exactly four and a half minutes before it's at lethal capacity.
Because that's when it's due to kill me.
Oh, shut up. Never mind. How can that Dalek even exist? It was erased from time and then it came back.
How?
It's not a light, it's a restoration field. But never mind, call it a light. That light brought Amy back, restored her, but how could it bring back a Dalek when the Daleks have never existed?
When the Tardis blew up, it caused a total event collapse. A time explosion. And that explosion blasted every atom in every moment of the universe. Except
The perfect prison. And inside it, perfectly preserved, a few billion atoms of the universe as it was. In theory, you could extrapolate the whole universe from a single one of them, like, like cloning a body from a single cell. And we've got the bumper family pack.
The box contains a memory of the universe, and the light transmits the memory, and that's how we're going to do it.
Relight the fire. Reboot the universe. Come on!
What if we give it a moment of infinite power? What if we can transmit the light from the Pandorica to every particle of space and time simultaneously?
Ah no, you see, it's not. It's almost completely impossible. One spark is all we need.
Big Bang Two! Now listen.
(sotto) Big Bang Two.
Amy Pond. The girl who waited all night in your garden. Was it worth it?
You asked me why I was taking you with me and I said, no reason. I was lying.
Yeah, it's the most important thing left in the universe. It's why I'm doing this. Amy, your house was too big. That big, empty house, and just you.
Where were your mum and dad? Where was everybody who lived in that big house?
How? What happened to them? Where did they go?
It's okay, it's okay. Don't panic, it's not your fault.
There was a crack in time in the wall of your bedroom, and it's been eating away at your life for a long time now. Amy Pond, all alone. The girl who didn't make sense. How could I resist?
Nothing is ever forgotten. Not really. But you have to try.
There's going to be a very big bang. Big Bang Two. Try and remember your family and they'll be there.
Because you're special. That crack in your wall, all that time, the universe pouring into your head. You brought Rory back. You can bring them back, too. You just remember and they'll be there.
You'll have your family back. You won't need your imaginary friend any more. Ha! Amy Pond crying over me, eh? Guess what?
Gotcha.
Oh! Okay. I escaped, then. Brilliant. I love it when I do that. Legs, yes. Bow tie, cool. I can buy a fez.
Lyle beach. The beach is the best. Automatic sand.
It's automated. Totally.
Oh.
Cleans up the lolly sticks all by itself.
No, hang on. That's last week when we went to Space Florida. I'm rewinding. My, my time stream unravelling, erasing. Closing.
Hello, universe. Goodbye, Doctor. Amy. Amy.
Ah, three weeks ago, when she put the card in the window. Amy! I need to tell you something. She can hear me. But if she can hear me
Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not let that girl open her eyes. Amy, later. River, going to need your computer.
Amy, you need to start trusting me. It's never been more important.
If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trust me.
I don't know yet but I'm working it out. Now, listen. Remember what I told you when you were seven?
No. No, that's not the point. You have to remember.
Amelia's house. When she was seven. The night she waited.
The girl who waited. Come here, you.
It's funny. I thought if you could hear me, I could hang on somehow. Silly me. Silly old Doctor. When you wake up, you'll have a mum and dad, and you won't even remember me. Well, you'll remember me a little. I'll be a story in your head. But that's okay. We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh? Because it was, you know. It was the best. The daft old man who stole a magic box and ran away. Did I ever tell you that I stole it? Well, I borrowed it. I was always going to take it back. Oh, that box. Amy, you'll dream about that box. It'll never leave you. Big and little at the same time. Brand new and ancient, and the bluest blue ever. And the times we had, eh? Would have had. Never had. In your dreams, they'll still be there. The Doctor and Amy Pond, and the days that never came. The cracks are closing. But they can't close properly until I'm on the other side. I don't belong here any more. I think I'll skip the rest of the rewind. I hate repeats. Live well. Love Rory. Bye bye, Pond.
Er, yeah. Completely astonished. Never expected that. How lucky I happened to be wearing this old thing. Hello, everyone. I'm Amy's imaginary friend. But I came anyway.
Amelia, from now on I shall be leaving the kissing duties to the brand new Mister Pond.
Yeah, it is.
Right then, everyone. I'll move my box. You're going to need the space. I only came for the dancing.
That's it. That's good. Keep it loose.
Two thousand years. The boy who waited. Good on you, mate.
You tell me.
The writing's all back, but I didn't peek.
Are you married, River?
Yes.
No, hang on. Did you think I was asking you to marry me, or or or asking if you were married?
No, but was that yes, or yes?
River, who are you?
Nah.
Sorry, you two. Shouldn't have slipped away. Bit busy, you know?
Space and time isn't safe yet. The Tardis exploded for a reason. Something drew the Tardis to this particular date, and blew it up. Why? And why now?
The Silence, whatever it is, is still out there, and I have to. Excuse me a moment.
Hello? Oh, hello. I'm sorry, this is a very bad line. No, no, no, but that's not possible. She was sealed into the seventh Obelisk. I was at the prayer meeting. Well, no, I get that it's important. An Egyptian goddess loose on the Orient Express, in space. Give us a mo. (to Amy and Rory) Sorry, something's come up. This will have to be goodbye.
Don't worry about a thing, your Majesty. We're on our way.

You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot.
What? Come out! (thud) And don't touch anything.
I've no idea.
I didn't expect him to start messing about with the helmic regulator. Come away from there, Harry.
I could what?
Not much oxygen. Still, nothing to worry about.
We can survive for quite a time yet.
Just a simply gravity reading, Sarah. Yes, almost certainly we're in some kind of artificial satellite. Now isn't that interesting?
I think it is.
All we have to do is get the power back on. Let's see what's over here.
Yes! That's better. Incredible.
I've never seen anything quite like it.
Definitely build on Earth, but I can't quite place the period.
In a minute, Sarah!
Judging by the macro-slave drive and that modified version of the Bennett oscillator, I'd say this was built in the early thirtieth Century?
You don't agree?
Late twenty ninth, early thirtieth, I feel sure.
Good heavens, no. Well beyond that.
Well, you gave that helmic regulator quite a twist, I'm afraid.
It's difficult to say. All this stuff's obviously been here for some time. Several thousand years at least. What was that?
Sarah? Where's she got to?
Impossible, I've got the key. I've told her time an again about going off by herself. Sarah?
There must be another exit, then.
Vacuum-tight panel, more likely. They used them a lot in these early space vessels. Ah. Just as I thought.
There must be a remote control. You haven't touched anything have you, Harry?
Well, there are only two of us here and your name is Harry.
Which switch, Harry?
Which switch?
Try to remember, Harry.
Think where you were standing.
Sure?
Go on, press it.
No air in here. Help me to get her back.
There must be a reverse mechanism.
How is she, Harry?
Must be a broken circuit.
Nothing. Nothing's working properly here.
I've found the oxygen supply.
No good, Harry.
Why is nothing functioning here?
What, with our bare hands?
I got us into this, Harry.
Then lie down and conserve the oxygen, while I do what I can. That's odd.
These cables have been sheared clean through. Oxygen valve servo-mechanism. Yellow, black, green.
Yellow, black, green. Yellow, black, green.
Harry. Harry?
Just in time. Are you feeling better?
Good. Give me a hand to lay her on that couch. It's nearer the vents.
I'll just repair some of those cables.
Or bitten.
There's a mystery here, Harry. Something happened a long time ago.
It looks like it. The interesting question is why? Clearly deliberate, therefore done for a purpose. Therefore, whatever it was had a reasoning intelligence.
Splendid! Now let's see if that panel works.
All systems go, wouldn't you say?
Good.
Welcome back, Sarah Jane.
There's some in the Tardis.
Get down, Harry?
Keep your head down.
We seem to be trapped, Harry.
Some sort of automatic guard. I hadn't bargained on this when I repaired the circuits. I wonder. Of course! That's why they were cut in the first place.
Tell her to stay where she is.
Apparently it's not activated by movement unless what moves is organic.
Not down here we're not, Harry.
Thank you.
To the far wall.
Inch it round your end.
One slip, Harry, and we'll be charcoal. Push on.
Psst, there it is.
The trouble is, we can't reach it from here.
The auto-guard cut-out. Look, up there, see? Never mind. Faithful old scarf.
It isn't a game of cricket, Harry.
Will this do?
Afraid so.
There's only one thing left. Risky, but it might work. You don't want your other shoe, do you?
Slip it off. Right. Now, I want you to throw it across the room. When I give the word, understand?
I'm going to try to distract it. Let's hope it's not double-barrelled. Ready?
Now!
I think we've done it, Harry.
Pity about the scarf. Madame Nostradamus made it for me. A witty little knitter. All right, Sarah, you can come out now. Never get another one like it.
Sarah?
What a fool. Of course!
Why didn't I realise? Short range matter transmitter. The strange thing is, Harry, it's only for internal relay.
Never mind. It just means that Sarah can't be far away. All we've got to do is find her. Come on!
I think we'll try this way first.
Not very likely.
Don't be nervous, Harry.
What is it?
Nonsense, Harry.
A trick of the light.
It's like the trail left by a gastropod mollusc.
Or a snail.
Very interesting. A multinucleate organism?
Let's find Sarah first. Come on.
This looks promising.
Decontamination chamber. Might make you feel a bit dizzy.
I think we're getting warm, Harry. Animal and Botanic.
Of course! That explains everything. Do you realise what this is? Aren't you feeling better?
Then pull yourself together, man. This is fascinating! This is a cryogenic repository.
Everything. Well, everything they considered worth preserving. Look at this.
Microfilm. It's a complete record. Music, history, architecture, literature, engineering. Incredible. The entire body of human thought and achievement.
Posterity? I don't know. Why build all this and send it into space?
Survival?
You're improving, Harry.
Yes, your mind is beginning to work. It's entirely due my influence, of course. You mustn't take any credit. Now, what's missing?
Yes. If we are to assume that some great cataclysm struck Earth, and that before the end they launched this lifeboat, then the one obvious missing element is man himself. What's happened to the human species, Harry?
This isn't a mortuary, Harry. Quite the reverse.
Cryogenic chamber.
Old principle, but I've never seen it applied on this scale. Look at them.
There must be hundreds here.
Corpse? These people aren't dead, Harry, they're asleep. The entire human race awaiting the trumpet blast.
Homo sapiens. What an inventive, invincible species. It's only a few million years since they've crawled up out of the mud and learned to walk. Puny, defenceless bipeds. They've survived flood, famine and plague. They've survived cosmic wars and holocausts, and now here they are amongst the stars, waiting to begin a new life, ready to outsit eternity. They're indomitable. Indomitable!
What do you think you're doing, Harry?
Suspended animation.
Total suspension, Harry.
You can't survive ten thousand years in a coma.
Fifty thousand years, a hundred thousand. Time is immaterial. It's an amazing sight, isn't it? The entire human race in one room. All colours, all creeds. All differences finally forgotten.
Well, it's chosen descendents. The operation must have been meticulously planned. Come on.
First to find Sarah, then we're going to shut down the systems. We're intruders here, you know.
Not end, Harry, just a pause.
Yes, and they saw it coming, and made provision for it as best they could. Don't forget, it's something for you to be proud of.
Yes?
Oxygen? Radiant heat? But this deep in space? I wonder.
Mould?
And that thing you saw moving in the corridor.
Hmm. Very convincing. All the same, I think we'll just check a few of the beds while we're here.
Just to make sure that everything's in order.
What have you found?
Sarah! Oh, Sarah Jane.
No. She'll be like that for three thousand years at least. Even if we had a resuscitation unit, it's doubtful that we could revive her now.
Very like an oxygen cylinder.
You'll recognise it if there is one.
Very dead. Almost mummified.
That's something we can leave till later. No sign of the resuscitation tank?
Emergency medical kit, wouldn't you say?
There must be something there that would help Sarah, but what? What?
Of course! They don't need a tank. The resuscitation phase is programmed in.
Look, she's starting to breathe.
No doubt about it.
Leave her, Harry.
There's nothing you can do. She knows what she's doing.
Well, there isn't very much to explain. We're just travellers in space like yourself.
My doctorate is purely honorary, and Harry here is only qualified to work on sailors.
Well, I'm delighted to hear it. You see, we happen to be in rather desperate need of medical help.
Is there any way of reversing the cryogenic process?
The answer is yes.
Perhaps we both are.
I see. You've changed her body into a battlefield.
We do seem to have a small communications problem.
What happened in the last days, Vira?
I'm afraid you're probably wrong about that.
Ah. Solar flares. I see.
Oh, the absolute minimum, I'd say. But I'm afraid I've something of a shock for you, Vira.
You've overslept by several thousand years. You see, when we came here, we found a massive systems failure.
Possibly not. But a long time ago, when you were dormant, you had a visitor. Come, I'll show it to you.
I don't know yet. But observe the size of the brain pan. It had a purpose in coming here, and once inside, it severed most of the satellite's control systems, including your alarm clock, so to speak.
No. For once in my life I feel surplus to requirements.
What is it?
I don't think the fault's at this end. It's in the main power supply.
Don't worry. I noticed the Ark has a secondary power supply. Harry, you stay here and keep an eye on things.
Harry?
In the control room. Have you got the power back on in there?
Splendid. The fault seems to be in the main solar stack. I'm just going to take a look.
Ah, there you are. Awake at last.
I'm just shutting down the power in the main stack.
Noah!
My dear man, if you think for one moment we're laying claim to Earth, you couldn't be more mistaken. We're here to help you.
Precisely. There's something trapped in the stack, Noah, but at the rate its absorbing energy it won't be trapped for long. The stack must be shut down. Well, if you'd been down there with me, Noah, you
You wouldn't find it so amusing.
Ah, Sarah, you're back. Splendid. Where's Noah? Shot me, did he? Cut off in mid sentence. I might have been saying something important. I was saying something important!
What? Blinding headache, that's all. I hate stun guns. Where is he?
Noah, of course. Who else?
What? The idiot. Quick, there might be still time.
Never mind about me, Harry, there's a man in danger.
Not her function, Harry.
By the thirtieth century, human society was highly compartmentalised. Vira is a med-tech, and I suspect we're an executive problem.
Unlike the thing you saw in the solar stack, eh, Noah?
Then it's escaped. We're too late.
You're absolutely right. There's no time to lose. Come on.
What was it you saw, Libri?
The process is much too slow. They're not going to make it.
He must be stopped.
Get after him, man.
Don't be an imbecile. Tell him, Vira.
Can you be sure?
When you first saw him, you had a subconscious impression, you said, of something horrible. That wasn't Noah, was it?
Believe me, he must be stopped.
Good.
You take some convincing that we're on your side, don't you. Now, what's all this about a missing technician?
It's not quite empty.
Membrane.
Part of the eggshell.
It's almost too horrible to think about.
The egg tube is empty.
The progenitor. The queen coloniser.
Ever heard of the Eumenes?
It's a genus of wasps that paralyses caterpillars and lays its eggs in their bodies. When the larvae emerge, they have a ready made food supply. Strange how the same life patterns recur throughout the universe.
Ciliated larvae, Harry. Dune was power systems technician, I imagine.
It, or they, went straight to the solar stack.
Has been thoroughly digested, I'm afraid.
When I say I'm afraid, Sarah, I'm not making jokes.
Absorb? We shall absorb the humans? Endoparasitism?
If the Wirrn can do that, we've no chance at all. Complete physical absorption.
They'll literally eat us alive. Vira, I must talk with Noah. You'd better come with me. He trusts you.
No. Noah has passed the command to you. Your duties have been widened.
To find out exactly what it is we're facing. And only Noah knows that.
Harry can handle that for you, can't you, Harry?
Well, you've watched Vira. You know the procedure.
He'll be all right.
And Sarah, you stay and help Harry.
Noah, tell us one thing. How much time do we have?
Before the Wirrn reach their adult form?
Let's go back.
But unfortunately, its larvae are still very much alive.
How much anatomy do you remember, Harry?
We need to find its weaknesses and we need to find them quickly.
Not at the moment, thank you.
What was that she just said?
What? (to Harry) Carry on with that thoracic incision. Not too deep.
Vira, the main phase must wait.
Noah was wrong. How long would it take?
Four whole days? At the rate at which the Wirrn are developing, they'll have pupated to imago long before then, and you know what that means.
You can't do it, Vira. The Ark will be crawling with those creatures within hours.
Vira, if you fail, your people will die in pain and fear. If I fail, they'll die anyway, but at least only the six of us will know anything about it.
Between the larval and imago forms, there must be a pupal stage. Now, the Wirrn will be dormant and defenceless. If we can find their weaknesses?
Yes.
Good.
No! The larvae have taken over the infrastructure. They seem to need solar radiation.
Yes, fascinating. A superb adaptation.
Obviously the creature's lungs recycle the wastes, almost certainly by enzymes. Quite wonderful. Carbon dioxide back to oxygen.
Exactly right. It must live in space, probably just occasionally visiting a planetary atmosphere for food and oxygen, the way a whale rises from the ocean.
No.
He now has the race memory of a Wirrn. Symbiotic atavism to be precise. I'm going to need your help now, Vira.
Do you have any spare extension leads, Rogin?
Hurry, man. Fetch them.
A little experiment. Circuit display, Lycett.
Right, switch on the video circuit, Lycett. It'll take a little time to warm up.
Sometimes latent neural impressions can be revived.
Yes.
Advanced technology. Gypsies used to believe that the eye retained its last image after death. Not so far out. No, it's not going to work. Switch off, Lycett.
It should work. The coil isn't giving a strong enough stimulus. I'll have to link in my own cerebral cortex. That's the only thing.
I know. Two more leads, Rogin.
I agree. An ordinary brain. But mine is exceptional.
I think not. Unless, of course, the experiment was interrupted. That could be dangerous.
If I can find out what it was that killed that creature, we might have a chance of fighting the Wirrn. That's our only hope.
It's not just our existence that's at stake, Sarah. It's the entire human race.
It may be irrational of me, but human beings are quite my favourite species. Vira.
Take this. (the gun) Don't hesitate to use it if anything goes wrong. You won't have much time.
Switch on, Lycett. Lycett?
Look, it's working.
Wirrn. Wirrn.
Wirrn!
Can't what? Is it time to get up?
Is that noise in my head?
Aim lower!
Why? Why have they gone over to the attack?
But they've only to wait. In their adult form they'll be a thousand times deadlier. Fission guns will have no effect then.
At a hatching? A hundred.
Electricity. Only by electricity. That's the one thing I found out.
Yes. It was the auto-guard that killed the queen. Half a million volts.
Amazing will power. I could feel it struggling against death until its task was done. Yes. Rogin, is there any way we can electrify the infrastructure?
Control centre? Right, let's go!
Yes, I was forgetting Noah's extra mobility.
No. The Wirrn are using Dune's knowledge of the Ark. Perhaps there's something he didn't know.
Nobody knows it all. Perhaps he's forgotten that these transmats are reversible?
Isn't it? And as you appreciate it, Rogin, you can go first. I'll give you a hand. Come on.
You next, Harry.
That was a power drain. Hello, control centre?
It's general, then. Do you have a fault reading?
Hmm. Malicious damage excluded.
Of course. In their pupal stage, the Wirrn don't need oxygen. An easy way of killing us.
What? We're not finished yet. You two stay here.
The infrastructure. If they've entered the pupal stage, they'll be dormant.
No, I'm not. I think his job's done now. He'll be metamorphosing too.
But the Wirrn live in space. You don't need the Ark.
But you could leave the Ark and go on. There's plenty of room in the galaxy for us all.
Time to leave.
We bumped into Noah.
Yes. Quite chatty this time. Garrulous, even.
Anyone for a jelly baby?
No?
Vira has no intention of leaving here, have you, Vira?
Of course you can't, so neither can we.
Besides, we can't let the Wirrn eat through the cryogenic sleepers as though they were a lot of
Exactly. Let them be turned into a lot of surrogate humans? It's the most immoral suggestion I've heard for a century.
High voltage power. If we can somehow send enough electrical power through the bulkheads of the cryogenic chamber
Yes. The Wirrn would never dare to cross it. The only problem is we don't have any electrical power and they control its sources, the solar stacks.
Unless we can lure them out of the infrastructure.
Bait. Human bait! If one of us could distract them for a few moments, I might be able to get down there and turn the power on.
Sarah, we're trying to make a plan.
Not if we electrify the switch itself.
Well we can't do without oxygen indefinitely. What was that you were trying to say, Sarah?
What about it?
How can we reach it?
Aren't there conduits?
Good girl, Sarah. Come on, we'd better hurry. The Wirrn are going to start moving any moment. You four go to the transport ship and I'll start wiring up the cryogenic chamber.
Come on, Sarah. Hurry!
Straight ahead. Look, I'll shine a light.
Can you see?
Of course you can. You've got this far.
Don't panic, Sarah. Don't panic. Ease round and try again.
Oh, stop whining, girl. You're useless.
Oh, Doctor. Is that all you can say for yourself? Stupid, foolish girl. We should never have relied on you. I knew you'd let us down.
That's the trouble with girls like you. You think you're tough, but when you're really up against it, you've no guts at all.
Hundreds of lives at stake and you lie there, blubbing.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
Splendid.
You've done marvellously, Sarah. I'm very proud of you. I really am very proud of you.
Me, a brute?
Don't be ungrateful. I was only encouraging you. Come on.
Close the door to the access chamber.
Are you ready, man?
Switch on now!
Not bad for a lash up.
Reporting to the others. They'll know where we are now.
For the moment.
The Wirrn don't give up that easily. They need the Ark. How is it your end?
I think we've got some more visitors. Don't let the power drop.
Gone away.
Either discretion is the better part of valour, or
Or they're planning something.
Unless they chew through the floor. I've left a free-running cable just in case. The insulation should stand up to it.
Cheer up, we're still on our feet.
No, and neither shall we, Sarah. What we're protecting here is too precious.
We'll find out soon enough.
She can hear you. What do you want, Noah?
And we control the cryogenic chamber. I repeat, what do you want?
Not a chance.
She agrees with me
Don't you, Vira.
She's busy, resuscitating more humans.
Listen, Noah. Now hear me. You're beaten. The Ark is of no value to you without its humans, so why don't you just leave us in peace?
And if we surrender?
The Wirrn hate all humans. Once we step outside this chamber we'd be attacked.
Noah, listen to me. If there's any part of you that's still human, if you've any memory of the man you once were, leave the Ark. Lead the swarm into space.
That's where the Wirrn belong, Noah. Not on Earth, not where you were born. Remember the wind and the sun, the fields, the blue sky? That's Earth, Noah. It's for the human race. Don't abandon it.
Are you all right over there?
We heard a rocket engine.
All right at the moment.
Keep in touch.
Hmm? It's your imagination.
How many of them are there, Vira?
How long will it take them to reach your control deck?
Tell Rogin to cut the power. We're coming out.
Good. Set the controls on automatic take off and evacuate the ship. Hurry!
Come on, Sarah. Come on! Run! Run!
Into the Ark, fast as you can! You too, Sarah! Harry, you go with the girls.
Rogin, help me with the synestic locks.
Just look after Sarah, Harry.
Just leave this to me.
There's no point in both of us being killed by the blast. Get into the Ark, man.
What?
Rogin's dead. I woke up in a protection hatch.
Yes, we're all safe now, Sarah, thanks to Rogin's bravery. And perhaps something else.
Yes, some vestige of human spirit. Was Noah on our side and one step ahead of us at the end?
More than a vestige of human spirit. It can all begin now, Vira. Mankind is safe.
Yes.
Yes, it could if it was functioning properly. The signal's faulty. Probably the diode receptors. I'll just beam down and check them.
Yes, that's where the trouble is. Here, fetch me a coat from the Tardis, will you? You never know what the solar flares have done to the weather.
What? Probably no more than a spot of corrosion. Whatever it is, it shouldn't take long to fix, and it'll give me a chance to see if the planet is fully viable again. What's keeping them? Sarah!
I don't remember inviting you two.
I hope you don't mind being left.
Have a jelly baby, Vira.

Take a punt.
Your choice. Wherever, whenever, anywhere in time and space.


Robin Hood.
Robin Hood, the heroic outlaw, who robs from the rich and gives to the poor.
He's made up. There's no such thing.







Earth. England. Sherwood Forest. 1190AD. Ish.But you'll only be disappointed.







No.



Because I am the Doctor.
And this is my spoon. En garde!
I've had some experience. Richard the Lionheart. Cyrano de Bergerac. Errol Flynn. He had the most enormous
Ego.



(sniffs)

Bye.


A miniscope. Yes, of course. Why not?





It's 1190.


When did you start believing in impossible heroes?

A mere bauble.
I want something else.

This is getting silly.
What are you doing? Put that down.

I know.
Robot.
Now we're getting somewhere.
He surrenders!
Hai!




You'd have been floating around in tiny little laughing bits in people's goblets.



No, hang on. Execute him.


Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard! Guard!
Oh.








Ah, so he can do the interrogating. Very wise.
No, no, no, no. no. He will get nothing from me, because interrogation, that's where I always turn the tables. You see, that's my plan.
No, no, chop-chop, come on.
No.
Don't be ridiculous!








None of your business.







No, no. I'll get them.
I'm fine, no, no worries. I've got them!









The Promised Land again.Like the Half-Faced Man, but more sophisticated. It disguised itself as a twelfth century castle.
It merges into the culture, tries to keep a low profile, so no one notices. That explains the robot knights. But the engines. The engines are damaged. They're leaking radiation into the local atmosphere, creating a temporary climate of staggering benevolence.


Isn't it time you came clean with me? You're not real and you know it. Look at you. Perfect eyes, perfect teeth. Nobody has a jawline like that. You're as much a part of what is happening here as the Sheriff and his metal knights. You're a robot.

I would like to see you try.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You can drop all that stuff now, Sheriff.

You're not fooling anyone, Sheriff.
No! Clara!


It won't work.

That's the engines, building in power. Stupid, stupid Sheriff.
Argh! Go on, give! Give, you stupid things. What are you looking at?
That's the principle. But he's a moron. If he tries to fly this ship, it'll explode and wipe out half the country. What we need is a little riot. Time to reflect on lasers and gold. Spread the word.


Everyone, the last one!
Out, out! Everyone, quickly, get out. Quickly!


Listen to me. It doesn't have to end like this. Shut it all down, return Clara to me and I'll do what I can.





Are you okay?
Good. We don't have long.
I know. The whole castle's about to blow.
Run! Come on, run!


You took it?
I love you boys.



No, no, no, no.







Well, I'm leaving him a present, aren't I?

Right, there we go. Universal roaming. Never have to worry about a signal again.
As long as you know the area code. Frequent flier's privilege. Go on, try it.
Distress signal. Locking on. Might be a bit of
Turbulence. Sorry. Come on, Martha. Let's take a look.
Whoa, now that is hot.
Venting systems. Working at full pelt, trying to cool down. Wherever it is we are. Well, if you can't stand the heat
Why would we be police?
If this is a ship, why can't I hear any engines?
Forty two minutes until what?
How many crew members on board?
Call the others, I'll get you out.
But my ship's in there!
It's our lifeboat.
So, we fix the engines, we steer the ship away from the sun. Simple. Engineering down here, is it?
Blimey, do you always leave things in such a mess?
Pretty efficiently too. Someone knew what they were doing.
Oh, we're in the Torajii system. Lovely. You're a long way from home, Martha. Half a universe away.
And you're still using energy scoops for fusion? Hasn't that been outlawed yet?
Oh, come on. Auxiliary engines. Every craft's got auxiliaries.
So a sonic screwdriver's no use.
Oh, listen to you. Defeated before you've even started. Where's your Dunkirk spirit? Who's got the door passwords?
Then what're you waiting for, Riley Vashti? Get on it.
Oi. Be careful.
How long's he been like this?
Don't get too close.
Korwin? Korwin, open your eyes for me a second.
Yeah, course you can. Go on.
All right, all right, all right. Just relax. Sedative?
Rising body temperature, unusual energy readings. Stasis chamber. I do love a good stasis chamber. Keep him sedated in there. Regulate the body temperature. And, just for fun, run a bioscan and tissue profile on a metabolic detail.
Oh, you're good. Anyone else presenting these symptoms?
Well, that's something.
Some sort of infection. We'll know more after the test results. Now, allons-y, back downstairs. Hey. See about those engines. Go. Hey. Go.
Call us if there's news. Any questions?
I'm the Doctor.
Abi, how's Korwin doing? Any results from the bio-scan?
Martha? Riley? How're you doing?
Yeah, you've
Got to move faster.
Three seven nine.
It's a sequence of
Happy primes. Three seven nine.
Just enter it.
Any number that reduces to one when you take the sum of the square of its digits
And you continue iterating until it yields one is a happy number.
Any number that doesn't, isn't. A happy prime is a number that is both happy and prime. Now type it in! I don't know, talk about dumbing down! Don't they teach recreational mathematics any more?
Keep moving, fast as you can.
And, Martha, be careful.
There may be something else on board this ship.
Will do, thanks.
We need a backup in case they don't reach the auxiliary engines in time. Come on, think. Resources. What have we got?
What is it now?
Elvis.
No! The Beatles!
No! Wait! Er, er. Oh, what was that remix? Er, I don't know. I am a bit busy.
Now, where was I? Here comes the sun. No, resources. So, the power's still working, the generator's going. If we can harness that. Ah!
Exactly. At the very least, it'll buy us some more time.
I know. See? Tiny glimmer of hope.
That told him.
What do you mean?
Stay here! Keep working!
I told you to stay in Engineering.
Oh, is he always this cheery?
Concentrate on those doors. You've got to keep moving
Forward.
Endothermic vaporisation. I've never seen one this ferocious. Burn with me.
His bioscan results. Internal temperature, one hundred degrees! Body oxygen replaced by hydrogen. Your husband hasn't been infected, he's been overwhelmed.
But what is it, though? A parasite? A mutagenic virus? Something that needs a host body, but how did it get inside him?
Where's the ship been? Have you made planet-fall recently? Docked with any other vessels? Any kind of external contact at all?
We've got to stop him before he kills again.
I don't know.
The parasite's too aggressive. Your husband's gone. There's no way back. I'm sorry.
Are you certain nothing happened to provoke this? Nobody's working on anything secret? Because it's vital that you tell me.
Then why is this thing so interested in you?
Keep going.
You've got to get to area one and reboot those engines.
Stay here. I mean it this time! Jump start those engines!
That's enough! What do you want? Why this ship? Tell me.
Come on. Let's see you. I want to know what you really are.
McDonnell? Ashton's heading in your direction.
DOCTOR [OC] He's been infected, just like Korwin!
I'll save you!
I'll save you!
I'll save you!
Scannell! I need a spacesuit in area seventeen now!
Just get down here!
You're wasting your breath, Scannell. You're not going to stop me.
Oh, just you watch.
If I can boost the magnetic lock on the ship's exterior, it should remagnetise the pod. Now, while I'm out there, you have got to get the rest of those doors open. We need those auxiliary engines.
I'm not going to lose her.
Come on! Go on, my son!
I can't, I can't reach! I don't know how much longer I can last.
It's alive. It's alive. It's alive!
Stay away from me!
It's your fault, Captain McDonnell!
You mined that sun. Stripped its surface for cheap fuel. You should have scanned for life!
That sun is alive. A living organism. They scooped out its heart, used it for fuel, and now it's screaming!
Because it's living in me.
Humans! You grab whatever's nearest and bleed it dry! You should have scanned!
You've got to freeze me, quickly.
Stasis chamber. You've got to take it below minus two hundred. Freeze it out of me! It'll use me to kill you if you don't. The closer we get to the sun, the stronger it gets! Med-centre, quickly! Quickly!
Martha, where are you?
Ten seconds. That's all I'll be able to take. No more. Martha!
It's burning me up. I can't control it. If you don't get rid of it, I could kill you. I could kill you all. I'm scared! I'm so scared!
It's burning through me. Then what'll happen?
There's this process, this thing that happens if I'm about to die.
No.
No! Martha, you can't stop it. Not yet.
Martha, listen! I've only got a moment. You've got to go!
Get to the front. Vent the engines. Sun particles in the fuel, get rid of them.
You've got to give back what they took.
Please go!
Martha!
I can't fight it. Give it back or burn with me.
Burn with me, Martha.
Compact, eh? And another good word, robust. Barely a scorch mark on her.
Just tell them. That sun needs care and protection just like any other living thing.
Now, what do you say? Ice skating on the mineral lakes of Kur-ha. Fancy it?
By the way, you'll be needing this.
Frequent flier's privilege. Thank you.

As I recall, Ace, we came here at your request.
So what's so terrible about Perivale?
You've been away as long as you think you have.
Any particular reason for coming here?
What for?
Oh, I'm sure I'll find something to interest me.
And horses.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ace?
Survival of the fittest. Rather a glib generalisation, don't you think? Survival for what, Mister er?
I can't remember. It's too long ago.
Tell me Sergeant, do you have a problem with strays?
Cats.
I've got to see a man about a cat.
Yes. Which do you think they'd prefer?
Well, these brands. Which one do you think our feline friends will find particularly irresistible?
Cheese! Ah, yes.
He doesn't have to outrun the lion, only his friend. Then the lion catches up with his friend and eats him. The strong survive, the weak are killed. The law of the jungle.
Yes, very clever, if you don't mind losing your friend. But what happens when the next lion turns up?
I think you'd better get your running shoes on, gentlemen.
Did you find your friends, then?
I'm sure I've forgotten something.
Yes.
No, it wasn't that.
Lucky?
Where are they all coming from?
Not a very efficient way to hunt, is it? All that noise and pantomime just to slaughter one little animal. No, if you're going to hunt, you stalk your prey. You observe it, so you can take it by surprise, and then you don't kill too many. Cover your tracks, so you don't leave a smell. Can you smell that?
Not sure.
When is a cat not a cat? When it builds its own cat flap.
Bait, Ace. Bait.
Tin opener.
Tin opener.
Hmm?
Quiet, Ace, I'm concentrating.
No, you're not the one I'm after.
Shush. Be quiet. Shoo.
Go on, go away! Go on! Shoo! Dog, go away!
Ace!
So, they've taken you away, taken you to their planet, but I'll find you.
Got you!
Sergeant!
What's it got to do with you?
I've no time for that. I've got to catch that cat!
Will you leave me go?
One finger can be a deadly weapon.
Why don't you come out and we'll talk about this sensibly, hmm?
Get off!
You stupid
Shut up, and we may survive.
Shush, shush.
Don't run!
No, Paterson!
They're just playing with him.
That was a useful trick before.
Charming.
Come on, pussycats! Come on!
Fetch! Come on, fetch!
Come on, Paterson!
A bit of healthy exercise, Paterson! Do you a world of good!
Hmm.
Very impressive.
We're on the planet of the Cheetah People, intelligent carnivores. No one knows much about them. They don't survive long enough to find anything out.
Yes. The trouble is, I've never heard of the Cheetah People hunting so far away from their feeding grounds before. And the kitling
That. A kitling. A feline vulture. It's got the power of teleportation. It can jump from world to world hunting for carrion.
I think we're going to be in big trouble, Sergeant.
Ahem.
How many times have I told you about playing with fire?
Oh, do shut up. This planet's disintegrating. According to my calculations, the safest place at the moment is over there.
We have to make our way through.
Well, it is an old planet, a bit frayed at the edges. We'll be safe over there. Safe from the Cheetahs, and the Master.
An evil genius. One of my oldest and deadliest of enemies.
I don't think he's trying to take over the galaxy this time.
He's got some mind-link. The cats, the kitlings.
Yeah.
They won't bother you unless they're hungry.
They're essentially a fun-loving species.
Is it my imagination, or am I getting hot?
Yes. Quietly, gently. Just taking a nice little stroll.
You see? It's all a matter of keeping your head and allowing for the unexpected.
Oh no.
Don't move!
There's one thing more dangerous than being attacked by a Cheetah, and that is attacking a Cheetah. You do not know what it will do to you!
Don't move!
Idiot!
Don't' move!
Stay still!
Don't run! Stay still!
I told you to stay still!
Stay still! Don't run!
Ace? Ace?
Ace. Oh, Ace.
It's breaking up.
How long before it blows up?
Why did you bring me here?
You're trapped. You can't escape.
Yes. They can only return home with their prey.
But now that we're both trapped, what good is it to you?
Why should I help you?
Ace?
They're extremely dangerous creatures. They could eat you. Or
Worse.
Let's just say they are dangerously attractive.
It could be useful to us.
They're hunting animals, Ace. We're their prey. They bring their prey home.
We need an animal whose home is Earth.
Ace.
It could be very dangerous for you.
I don't know. We'll have to find them, and soon.
Connected.
What do you feel?
Anything else?
Midge!
Sorts him out?
Where did you get this?
Midge! It's not too late to go home.
Come on. We'd better follow him.
This way.
Midge!
Midge, wait.
Midge, listen to me.
A way out? Yes. We wait for one of us to change and then we use them, before they try to escape or kill us all.
Wait.
No.
Yes.
We'd be in even more trouble than we are already! Right, stay here. I'll follow her.
I can leave you in charge, can't I, Sergeant?
Stay still and try not to look like a hamburger. Don't look so glum. It could be worse. It could be Perivale.
Oh, Ace, you're running, but what are you running towards?
Ace, how far have you gone? Can you come back?
Ace! Ace, come back. Come home. Come home.
It's all right, Ace. We're going home.
Ace, listen to me. You're possessed. It's the planet, the Cheetah people. You've changed.
You're powerful, dangerous.
You can do what they do. You can carry your prey home. You can help us escape.
But if you do that, you may never change back. You'll become like the Cheetah people forever.
The choice is yours.
We're going home!
Yes, Ace.
Unfinished business.
The Master.
It was you
No, it was you who brought us here, home. Therefore, Midge must have. Where does Midge live?
Midge!
Come on!
Ace!
What man? Which way did he go? Show me!
Malice.
Survival. Huh. It's what he lives for. He must hope, believe, he can find something.
To destroy me.
Yes, well, we are an explosive combination. One day, one of us might blot the other one out.
If only I could track him down, take him by surprise before he's ready.
So much for the SAS survival course.
Where?
He's chosen the time, the place, and the means.
Ace.
That's better.
Stay out of this, Ace!
Ace! Listen to me. Listen to me!
If you fight, you'll change, you'll change completely forever!
Oh, very good. Very amusing.
Good hunting.
They do say opposites attract.
No.
They've gone. What am I doing? I've got to stop. We've got to go.
Yes, we can!
If we fight, we'll destroy this planet. We'll destroy ourselves!
If we fight like animals, we'll die like animals!
If we fight like animals, we'll die like animals!
Home.
I think you'll find things quieting down now.
Well, we try.
Mine, I believe.
Thank you.
They've been taken back to the wilderness. The place is different but the hunt goes on. You know all about the hunt, don't you, Ace?
The planet's gone, but lives on inside you. It always will.
Who knows? Where to now, Ace?
Home?
Yes, the Tardis.
There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, where the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace, we've got work to do!

We're not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay. She'll be perfectly all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so much.
Well, where would you like to go?
I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie.
Jamie, we're landing. Jamie!
We're landing!
Let's have a look at the scanner, shall we?
Oh, yes, we are, but I seem to have lost the picture. Let's try a little bit more power, shall we?
Yes, of course I am. Look at the fault indicator, will you? It's round there on the left.
No movement at all?
Well, that's funny. The air's all right, the temperature's perfectly normal. There seems to be rather a lot of metal all around us
There we are, it's coming up now.
Well, that's funny, it's changed to night now.
Oh dear. Those pictures aren't what's happening outside, I'm certain of that.
They're temptations.
The Tardis is trying to warn us to get away from here to somewhere more pleasant. I must have pushed the wrong switch.
What?
What? Well the power's overloading. The power lines are overloading! (There's a flash.)
The fluid link's gone!
The mercury's vapourising! We've got to get out of here, come on.
Hold on to me.
Just hold on!
I disengaged the time vector generator.
Well once removed, it alters the size of the Tardis. The inside becomes an ordinary telephone box again. Come along, come and sit over here.
If I hadn't have done, the mercury vapour would have killed us.
It looks like the motor section of some sort of rocket.
Oh, yes. There's an artificial gravity system, too.
Well, it's what keeps us on our feet, otherwise we'd be floating around.
Water, no. Not in here, Jamie. There's no movement either, is there.
Yes, I expect so. Ouch!
Have a lemon sherbet. It'll quench your thirst.
Jamie.
Look. It's a track.
Why, that's oil. It must be some sort of machine. It's recent, too.
No. No, there may be something on the other side. Here.
Here we are.
Yes. What caused the defence mechanism of the Tardis to register danger then? And where's the crew? And what's this track? There's plenty of air in there. Let's try and get in.
It's living quarters here.
Yes, Jamie, it does. It carries four. Two on duty and two resting.
Isn't there?
We're just drifting, Jamie. Drifting aimlessly in space. Perhaps that's what the Tardis was trying to warn us about.
Matter? We're just a piece of space flotsam, don't you realise that?
Time vector generator.
No, it's not as simple as that, Jamie. The fluid, hmm? We need mercury to refill it, don't we.
Yes, I hope so.
What's happened to the crew? They haven't just gone out for a little constitutional, you know.
Well, I've searched my side. There's not a drop of mercury anywhere.
Well, we'll have a breather, and then we'll try in there.
I can give you another lemon drop.
What do you fancy?
I'll see what I can do.
Roast beef, you said?
What vegetables?
Potatoes.
And cabbage. What about a drop of fruit salad?
And I'll have some pork, potatoes and carrots. And, I'll have a drop of ice-cream.
There we are. what about the gravy?
Gravy.
Yes, of course. It'll be delicious.
Sit down and eat up.
Now? Time is relative, Jamie. If I knew when 'now' was, I might be able to hazard a guess.
Well, she's decided to stay in a good historical period. Very few wars, great prosperity. She'll be happy enough. This is very filling, isn't it?
Well, when we've digested our dinner we'll have another try to get into the control room.
I don't know, Jamie. I wish I did. I suppose they've been overtaken by some disaster or other. Perhaps we'll find out when we get into the control room. (The control room door opens and the little robot comes out and goes to the open door of the motor section. It is quite slow, and is constantly taking readings of its surroundings. The Doctor is using his pocket telescope to look out of the porthole.)
Well, at least we don't seem to be in any immediate danger, Jamie. But I would like to know
I hit my head. Oh!
Yes, I know. There's someone in the control room.
No, no, Jamie. We've got to get back to the Tardis. It's the only safe place.
Never mind that.
Lock it, Jamie. Lock it.
Into the Tardis. I've got to get him to safety.
Jamie, take this. It's a gun. Like a torch. You have to be careful.
Well that's marvellous, isn't it? The Doctor told me to protect it. You don't give a reason, just leave me to get you out of trouble.
Oh, I suppose so.
I was just beginning to enjoy this little rest.
I don't know. Jamie, what exactly did happen on the rocket? Well don't look at me like that.
It's a bit hazy.
I suppose I hit my head.
No, but it's there. It's there at the back of my mind.
Machine? No. But there's something. Some warning, some menace.
Oh, we keep fit one way and another. I suppose all this mean I've got to get up.
Oh good.
Well, it did, but it's better now.
Well, just a little.
I think you'll find my psyche in very good order.
Oh yes, I can, perfectly. We're not saboteurs, you know.
The last thing we want to do is to interfere with what you're doing here, or put you in any danger. You saved our lives on that rocket and we're very grateful.
Guard?
Oh, no.
I don't think we've met, have we?
Oh. Oh, yes. And what do you do here, Zoe?
Oh, I am impressed.
What question?
So what's your theory?
Well, it's an interesting theory.
Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority. Supposing there was a faulty automatic pilot.
Well, it's a possibility.
This was found by the body, was it?
The Gordian knot couldn't be untied, either.
It means there's always a solution.
And the Bernalium is a write-off, is it?
And the X-ray laser gun, the main armament of the Wheel, relies on Bernalium?
It's a possibility, isn't it. Jamie, what do you think?
And murders?
Well, it's an interesting theory.
Hmm.. It doesn't fit this.
Well, we can find out.
With the X-ray machine.
Simple common sense works wonders sometimes, Zoe.
Here we go. Now, let's see what we got. (The image projected on the wall clearly shows what is inside the plastic.)
It's a Cybermat!
The lights, Jamie, the lights. Cybermats.
Yes, and there is only one place where they can be. On that rocket!
The Cybermen are threatening this Space Wheel.
But Cybermen exist. You've got to believe me. You've got to!
They were once men, human beings like yourself, from the planet Mondas, but now they're more robot then man.
Oh no, more than that. Their entire bodies are mechanical and their brains have been treated neuro-surgically to remove all human emotions, all sense of pain. They're ruthless, inhuman killers!
It's not rubbish! They'll kill anyone who stands in their path. You've got to believe me. You've just got to!
But don't you understand? The Cybermen will get inside this space Wheel.
They already sent their Cybermats in to weaken you.
Oh, dear. How do you convince a man like that?
They will find a way.
It's an alien machine. Destructive. Capable of killing.
Yes, it's a pity you didn't tell somebody sooner.
Yes.
Meteorites. Yes. Now the Cybermats must have sent in to destroy the laser gun but
What?
You see, Jamie.
Yes, but why?
But the Wheel must have other defences?
No, I think the Bernalium was destroyed for another purpose, but what? What?
Extraordinary? Extraordinary?
Oh, I'm so glad there is no damage. Miss Corwyn.
Oh. Oh, forgive me.
Oh. I'm so sorry.
Gemma. How nice. Gemma, tell me. Tell me about the Controller, Jarvis.
He's a strange man to be in a position like this.
Are there any ordinary circumstances in space?
Yes, that's a very accurate
You're very perceptive.
Don't you?
Exactly. One does wonder what a man like that will do when faced with a problem for which he has no solution.
Of course I have to get up.
Now, Gemma, be reasonable. I know the dangers. The Cybermen need to colonise. They must have the treasures of Earth.
He's not in control of himself.
Oh. Oh, thank you. You will tell the guard, won't you?
I see.
Do you have any coffee?
I'd love some, I really would.
That's better than nothing.
Oh, yes, of course.
No, Jamie, I haven't forgotten. I'm worried about the Tardis. If I'm right and those Cybermen are. What's going on?
What's going on, Zoe?
I wouldn't dream of contradicting you. Can you repair the laser gun in time?
Oh dear, he's getting worse.
Why aren't you worried about the laser gun? I thought all of the Bernalium has been destroyed.
Oh good.
Ah. What? What did you say?
Gemma! Gemma, did you know about this Bernalium from the rocket?
Don't you see what it means? The Cybermen are here. They came over in that crate.
But they didn't know what they were doing. They were just obeying orders.
Yes, something like that.
Yes, but a psychotropic drug is only effective against a known enemy. Have you induced repulsion in all parts of the brain yet?
How can we check?
I see.
Yes, yes, please. Is that all right?
Er, can we pin it down to an individual?
No, stop him!
He's dead. Now, now listen, listen everyone. The Cybermen are here, in this Wheel. They took over this poor fellow to stop you sending for help or signalling to Earth. Now just a minute. Gemma, you must alert the whole Wheel and you'll need something stronger than drugs to stop your people from being taken over. It doesn't matter how crude it is. A metal plate and a transistor will do. Tape them to the back of the neck. It will absorb the Cyber control signals.
Yes. Good.
Right.
We're going hunting, Jamie.
A very good question. Come on.
What is it?
Jamie, I know. Now, shush.
Yes, this is it.
It's a false bottom, you see.
It's so easy.
I don't understand them.
Destroying the wheel, Jamie, that's what I'm talking about. From the outside it's strong enough, but now that the Cybermen are inside, I
Well, they obviously don't want to destroy the Wheel.
I wish I knew. The first thing we must do is to protect the people here.
What's the thing which we need to survive which the Cybermen don't?
Always thinking of your stomach, aren't you. No. Air, Jamie, air. Now, I wonder how this works.
Hello. I think that it would be wise to lock all the air-lock doors. Can you do that?
The Cybermen are definitely on the Wheel. Jamie and I have just seen one. They may try to interfere with the air supply.
What? Keep this channel open.
Listen to me very carefully. Do as I ask and don't delay. One of the Cybermats is very close to us. It'll tune into our brain waves at any minute.
Hook up a variable audio-frequency on this channel right away. Do it at once!
No. We don't stand a chance. They've got a range of at least ten feet.
Hurry. Please hurry.
We're coming back as fast as we can. This is what you've saved us from.
Exactly.
Not necessary complete. Catatonic features certainly.
Is the equipment here?
Oh, I wouldn't advise moving him. You've thrown a magnetic forcefield round this section?
Enough to keep the Cybermen out?
No, it's no good. You're second in command. You must take over.
Well, I'm not surprised you can't get in touch with the rest of the Wheel.
With the metal plates, you mean. Has everybody had them fitted to the back of their necks?
Well, it would be advisable to have it done.
Well, it would be as well not to miss then, wouldn't it.
I think it is reasonable to assume that the Cybermen caused that star to go nova.
No. Not to destroy the Wheel. To make you want to use the laser. Then they sent in their Cybermats to attack the laser and destroy the Bernalium.
With the Cybermen inside it.
It was only way they could get into the Wheel.
So you see this isn't just an attack by an alien race on a space station. The Cybermen have another purpose.
They have an over-riding ambition to invade the Earth, plunder its mineral wealth, and somehow they see a way of doing it through this Wheel.
I don't know.
Hmm? Yes. Jamie, the Time Vector Generator from the Tardis. Where is it?
Yes, yes, where is it?
Are you sure?
But I haven't got it.
Important? Someone'll have to go over to the rocket to get it.
Well, if Gemma can spare someone to show you how to make the journey.
Yes, of course. You're the only one who knows what it looks like besides me, and I'm much too busy. Besides, it's your fault that it's lost.
Well, isn't it?
She, she agreed to go.
I had to. Jamie will look after her.
Well, they knew the risk. Zoe calculated it.
Yes?
Good.
Yes?
Gemma, run! Get away from there! Run!
Gemma, can you hear me? Gemma! Gemma!
Gemma!
What about Jamie and Zoe?
Zoe calculated the risk. Let's hope she was right.
Any signs of Jamie and Zoe?
Do you think I don't know that? It was a calculated risk that had to be taken.
Because there's something on board that rocket that we've got to have if we're going to beat the Cybermen.
Yes, to save many. But anyway, we're all going to get killed shortly unless you switch over to sectional air supply.
The Cybermen are going to poison the air.
Gemma told me.
She's in the Oxygen room.
No, no. Well, you can't. She's dead.
She sacrificed her life to warn us.
Well, thank heavens. Hello, where's Jarvis? (Bennett is striding along a corridor. Lernov switches the wall monitor to different views searching for him.)
No, wait. You're too late. Look!
That remains to be seen.
But they wouldn't go to all this trouble just to knock out one small space Wheel.
It could be a Cyberman spaceship.
Possibly.
Excuse me. Tell him I will go for the spares.
I think that it's essential that I go.
Now listen, as soon as Flannigan comes through the force field, grab him!
I somehow don't think he will. Now please do as I say. I'll have the map. Now remember, don't trust him. Check the metal plate on the back of his neck.
Ah, mercury.
Yes, I don't see why it shouldn't work.
I've got the spares.
Jamie! Oh thank heavens. Are you and Zoe all right?
Yes, yes, I guessed they would. Have you got the Time Vector Generator?
Good! Now, now listen to me, I want you to bring it to me. Get someone to show you the way through the air corridors. Hello. I think I've got company.
I suppose you've come for me.
Yes, I thought you'd realise somebody did. I imagine you have orders to destroy me.
Tell me one thing. Why did you order Duggan to destroy radio communication with the Earth? After all, that is why you want possession of the Wheel, isn't it?
That doesn't answer my question.
Oh, I see. How interesting. Yes, of course. And presumably your large spaceship holds your invasion fleet, and the smaller ships can only enter the Earth's atmosphere by homing on a radio beam.
Yes, well, I was afraid you'd get back to that. Well, you'd better come in.
You can't get through the field, you know.
Jamie! Is he all right?
Yes, but they're sending in reinforcements, probably through the Loading Bay. Have you got the rod? Thank you. I'm going to try and fix this into the laser gun circuit. With any luck, I should be able to boost the power enough to destroy the Cyberman spaceship. But you'll have to hold them off at the loading bay. I need time.
Well, there's still a Cyberman left, so watch out for him.
Good. Here's a metal plate for Vallance.
I'm trying to put some extra power in your laser. Line it up on the Cyberman spaceship and I'll let you know when I'm ready.
Yes, I know. They're going to invade us.
Yes, all right.
Right. Everything is ready here.
Jamie!
Yes. I've even got some mercury left over.
Yes, I think
Just a little matter to settle first, I think, Jamie.
Now, Jamie, it's not impossible. It's something that we have to decide. You may change your mind.
I wonder. Zoe, watch the screen up there.
I'm going to show Zoe the sort of thing that she may be in for.
Yes. Only I'm going to weave them into a complete story for you. Have you ever heard of the Daleks?
Then watch.

Surprised! Ha, ha! Hello, everyone. Guess who. Please, point a gun at me if it helps you relax.
You're only human.
Three minutes forty seconds. Amelia Pond! Get your coat!
I'm not a phantom.
I'm not a trick.
I'm a monk.
Not if we knock out your communications array. And you've got incoming.
Give 'em hell, Danny Boy.
Sorry, Colonel Manton. I lied. Three minutes forty two seconds.
No. Colonel Manton, I want you to tell your men to run away.
Those words. Run away. I want you to be famous for those exact words. I want people to call you Colonel Run Away. I want children laughing outside your door, because they've found the house of Colonel Run Away. And, when people come to you, and ask if trying to get to me through the people I love is in any way a good idea, I want you to tell them your name. Oh, look, I'm angry. That's new. I'm really not sure what's going to happen now.
Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many.
Urgh. Kissing and crying. I'll, I'll be back in a bit.
Hello. Hello, baby.
Melody? Hello, Melody Pond.
Well yes, I suppose she does smell nice. Never really sniffed her. Maybe I should give it a go. Amelia Pond, come here.
I'm sorry we were so long.
It's okay. She's still all yours. And really, you should call her mummy, not big milk thing.
I speak Baby.
I speak everything, don't I, Melody Pond. No, it's not. it's cool.
She's not hungry, she's tired. Sorry, Melody, they're just not listening.
Very pretty, according to your daughter.
No flies on the Roman. Give her here.
No.
No, it's real. It's my hair.
Be right there! Things to do. I've still got to work out what this base is for. We can't leave till we know.
Er, Centurian, permission to hug?
At all times. You were on the Tardis, too. Your heart, your mind, your soul. But physically, yes, you were still in this place.
Reality bleeding through. They must have taken you quite a while back. Just before America.
Yeah, they're very clever.
Exactly.
Well, I couldn't be sure they weren't listening.
It's mine.
The cot. It's my cot. I slept in there.
You've hacked into their software, then?
Ooo. So what have we learned?
I'm sorry?
Well, you were very cross at the time.
Sorry, what? Of course she is. Completely human. What are you talking about?
Human DNA.
But she's human. She's Amy and Rory's daughter.
Over billions of years. It didn't just happen.
No, no. I don't think so.
Because I don't understand how this happened.
When?
Oh, you mean
Well, how would I know? That's all human-y, private stuff. It just sort of goes on. They don't put up a balloon, or anything.
No! No! Impossible! It's all running about, sexy fish vampires and blowing up stuff. And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning. Then he was dead, then he didn't exist, then he was plastic. Then I had to reboot the whole universe. Long story. So, technically the first time they were on the Tardis together in this version of reality, was on their w
On their wedding night.
It doesn't make sense. You can't just cook yourself a Time Lord.
Amy. She worried the baby would have a time head. She said that
Why even do it? Even if you could get your hands on a brand new Time Lord, what for?
Why would a Time Lord be a weapon?
Me?
Me?
What is she?
What war? Against who?
A child is not a weapon!
Except you've already lost her, and I swear I will never let you anywhere near her again.
Amy. Amy.
Amy!
Amy!
Amy!
Amy, she's not real! Melody, she's a Flesh avatar. Amy!
Amy! Amy.
I am so sorry.
Hey. Hello.
You helped my friends. Thank you.
Hey, of course I remember. I remember everyone. Hey, we ran, you and me. Didn't we run, Lorna?
Who was she?
They're always brave. They're always brave.
Yes, they did. And it's already too late.
Yeah, and don't you sometimes wish I did?
Where the hell have you been? Every time you've asked, I have been there. Where the hell were you today?
You could have tried!
You think I wanted this? I didn't do this. This, this wasn't me!
Who are you?
No, no, you tell me. Tell me who you are.
Hello.
But but that means
Ooo. But you and I, we, we, we, er (kiss kiss)
How do I look?
I'd better be.
Vastra and Jenny, till the next time. Rory and Amy, I know where to find your daughter, and on my life, she will be safe. River, get them all home.

Well, I suggest before we go outside and explore, let us clean ourselves up.
Now what does the radiation read, Susan?
The heat must have been indescribable. Look at this soil here. Look at it. It's all turn to sand and ashes. Extraordinary. How can shrubs or trees grow in soil like that, hmm?
It's petrified. How fascinating, a petrified jungle. Hm. Extraordinary. Yes, I must really investigate that. Couldn't have been heat, then, and age would merely decay.
I don't know, I don't know, but I intend to find out.
Yes, very pretty, very pretty. Hm.
Yes, it's certainly alien to anything on your planet. But you're wrong about one thing, Chesterfield. This isn't like everything else. The animal is solidified, certainly, but it's not crumbly stone. It's metal. Yes, it always was.
Why? Can't you imagine an animal unless it's flesh, blood and bone, hmm? No, I tell you this is an entirely different formation. I should say originally it was some pliable metal held together by a magnetic field, or an inner magnetic field, rather, and it may have had the ability to attract it's victims towards it, if they were metal too.
No, certainly not.
Oh, certain. And you needn't look at me like that, young man. We started this journey far too hurriedly to make any calculations. You know that as well as I do. However, we're alive.
Well now, are we ready?
No, not really, not really. Whatever it was destroyed everything that was living, but the planet is dead, totally dead.
What is it, Chesterton? We really must get back to
Most fascinating.
No, no, no sign of life. No, just buildings. Magnificent buildings, I
I don't know, I don't know. Whatever it was destroyed the vegetation here certainly hasn't damaged the city. But there's no sign of life. No movement, no light, no. No, I shall know more about it when I've been down there.
Now, don't be ridiculous. That city down there is a magnificent subject for study, and I don't intend to leave here until I've thoroughly investigated it.
Yes, yes, yes, all right then. But I assure you I'm determined to study that place.
Very well then. I shall look at it myself, alone.
Yes, yes. She's convinced that someone touched her, and I tried to make her see it wasn't possible but I'm afraid she wouldn't listen to me. I wonder, would you have a talk with her?
Yes, you know, sometimes I find the gulf between Susan's age and mine makes difficult understanding between us.
Oh, would you? Thank you, thank you very much. I'd be grateful.
You're quite right, quite right.
Hmm? Oh.
My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know where we are, I suppose?
You pushed your way into the ship, young man.
Oh, small?
A very good idea. I'm hungry.
Oh, what's the matter?
Oh, dear, dear, how irksome for you. Oh, this stuff is very good. This should cure it. Now, not too much, dear, not too much.
Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like?
Bacon and eggs.
Yes, certainly, certainly. J62.
L6.
Now, now, now, don't be ridiculous.
Bacon and eggs.
Well?
It shouldn't be. It's English.
Food has component parts, dear boy. Flavours are rather like primary colours, you know, you blend two to achieve a third, a fourth, etc, etc.
Susan, would you like something to eat?
Oh, child, that's unusual. I do hope your affects outside the ship hasn't affected you too much.
Right.
The scanner.
Ah, but the city. I must see the city.
I will not be questioned. Uninvited passengers. I didn't invite them to the ship. I shall do what I want to do.
I don't know. The power take-up was rising normally and
Oh don't distract me, please.
Yes, I think you'd better, child.
K7? Ah, yes, of course, the fluid link. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.
Yes, there we are, you see. The end of it's unscrewed itself and the fluid has run out.
Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired. All we have to do is refill it.
Mercury.
No, I'm afraid you can't. We haven't any at all.
No.
No, it hasn't been necessary. This hasn't happened before.
No, no. We shall have to get some from outside.
Yes, the city, of course. Of course we're bound to get some mercury there. Yes, we're bound to. Well, I mean, what else can we do, hmm?
Yes, indeed. At first light, then?
Oh, quite so, quite so.
Yes, by all means.
What is it, Chesterton?
Let me see.
Yes, I'd like to run a few tests on those. Susan, would you take these into the ship, please?
Thank you. Oh, and by the way, did you remember the food supplies?
Yes, ample, ample.
Do you mind if I sit down for a minute? I feel a bit exhausted.
Yes, I'm just a bit tired. It was a long journey and my legs are rather weak.
No, no, no, no, I want to look around too. I shall be all right, thank you.
Would you lend me your arm, would you, Susan? Thank you.
Wait.
Listen.
Quiet, child. Now listen.
It's stopped now.
Measuring equipment. But measuring what? Look here. Look at this drum. The ink's still quite wet.
They're intelligent, anyway. Very intelligent.
Oh, as if that matters. What these instruments tell us is that we're in the midst of a very, very advanced civilised society.
Yes, yes, that explains a lot of things, doesn't it. A jungle turned to stone, the barren soil and the fact that we're not feeling well.
Yes, I'm afraid so. The atmosphere here is polluted with a very high level of fallout, and we've been walking around in it completely unprotected.
A neutron bomb. Yes. It destroys all human tissue, but leaves the buildings and machinery intact. Yes.
We need, we need drugs to be treated.
For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little on that. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go on and, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with the fluid link.
Abuse me as much as you like, Chesterton. The point is we need an immediate return to the ship, and I suggest we leave at once.
Very well. You may stay and search for her if you wish, but Susan and I are going back to the ship. Now, come along, child.
Give that to me.
Give it to me, I say.
Chesterton, this is
Child, if only you'd think as an adult sometimes. Oh, very well. Let's go then. Let's go.
Well, unless, unless we get treatment, we shall die. Yes, we shall die.
I don't understand you.
Why? Because we were not aware of it until it was too late, that's why.
No, no. Thals? What are you talking about? We're not Thals, or whatever you may call them. Can't you see we're very ill.
We have no drugs. (softly) A drug? A drug. The drugs left outside the Tardis.
Listen to me.
My friends and I are travellers. We did find something in the forest near our encampment. They may be the drugs you're referring to. Why not let one of us go and bring the phials here? And under guard, if necessary.
Very well, then. Let one of us go and hold the others until he returns.
He will have our lives in his hands. That is enough.
Tell me something about the people, the Thals.
And the Thals?
And knowing that these mutated creatures exist outside the city, you're willing to send one of us in amongst them?
In a moment, child. The phial of drugs left outside the Tardis, remember?
It's possible that they may have been anti-radiation gloves. Drugs. I can't be certain, but it does give us a chance. The people here, whoever they may be, are very eager to get hold of them.
Whoever goes must be very careful. As far as I can ascertain, the creatures out there are the ones who dropped the box. They're called Thals. They're mutations.
No. If they were drugs. I've learnt quite a lot from the Daleks.
The Daleks, our captors here. Oh, if I didn't feel so. Oh. But I was right about the neutron bomb. The Daleks built this underground city as a kind of huge shelter.
I don't know.
Susan.
Give me a little while and then we must go back to the ship.
Oh, are we? Oh, yes. Well, we must leave here soon. We must, must leave. Yes.
I can't understand. Why have they taken Susan?
Perhaps they're going to let us go. I don't know.
Or suspect them either.
I tell you, the Daleks are brilliant people. I think we ought to cooperate with them.
Take your hands off me. How dare you shout
Keep away from me!
Don't waste time.
The point is, how do we get out of here? Wait until the Daleks open the door, and force the issue?
The floors are metal. All the floors are metal.
Why?
No, I know you don't know. I mean, why do they use metal? Is it because it lasts longer? Or because
No, no, no, now listen. Let's concentrate on the Daleks. Have you noticed, for example, that when they move about there's a sort of acrid smell?
It's electricity. I think they're powered that way.
No, no. I believe the Daleks have discovered a way to exploit static electricity. Very ingenious, if I'm right.
Precisely. If I'm right, of course. Now, what do we know apart from guessing how they are powered?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, Chesterton, do you mind concentrating, young man?
And what will it do, young man? Hmm?
Ready?
Now all of you watch very carefully. See that you notice every detail in that machine, right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
If he's on time, we have three minutes.
How's the mud?
Very good. Very good idea.
Yes, yes. Not too near the door. We don't want to make him suspicious.
Yes, yes. Quickly. Good, child.
Mind your head.
Now!
Well done, Susan.
Are you all right, Susan?
Splendid, splendid.
Yes.
Barbara, Susan, give me a hand. Move it down gently. (they lower the lid) How is it?
Well, can't you sound more like a Dalek?
That's it.
Don't worry, we'll push you.
No, no, no, it won't be suspicious at all.
It's up to you now, Chesterton. You have to do as little talking as possible.
That's fixed the door.
Here, let me help fix it.
Wait a minute. There, it's free. Lift it from the top.
Chesterton, try and force it up from the inside.
They're cutting through the door.
Yes, but hurry, hurry.
They've magnetised the floor. You feel it?
Yes. Chesterton, we're not able to get you into the lift.
Well, come on. He's right.
When we get to the top, we'll send the lift back down for you. All right?
Come on, Susan.
Oh, maybe ten minutes. If we're lucky, longer.
Susan, it's no good. We cannot do anything for him now, child.
Well never mind that now. We must try and find a way out of this room.
We're right at the top of the building. I can just see the surface of the city. See over there? There's the edge of the petrified jungle.
A Dalek?
They're walking into an ambush.
Yes, but how, dear boy?
Well, yes.
They've magnetised it, too. Come on, let's try and force it open.
It's open. I've done it.
Look, what are you doing?
Well, lets get back to the ship.
Susan.
The Thals are no concern of ours. We cannot jeopardise our lives getting involved in an affair which is none of our business.
Good luck, Chesterton.
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. You know, these records must go back nearly half a million years.
Oh, nonsense, young lady. Your survival is all here. What, er, is this a solar system?
I see. And this? What is this planet?
Total? Oh, you have records of other systems?
Yes, I see. I wonder if I could see the plans.
I might be able to fix our position. Oh, yes, yes. Absorbing, most absorbing.
I say, I say, I think these'll interest you. (pictures) Look here. This is these people's ancestor, the original Thal male. There was a neutron war here. Most died and the survivors mutated. But in the case of the Thals, mutation came round in full circle then refined itself into what you see.
Yes, yes. It took hundreds of years, of course. In the second example, our recent hosts, the mutation has not completed its full circle. Why, I don't know. But do you remember that monstrosity we took out of its machine?
This is its forebear.
Yes. They called them Dals then. Oh, it's all there, every moment of it is Skaroene history. Minutely but brilliantly recorded. Priceless, absolutely priceless.
Yes. They were the warriors then.
Undoubtedly.
I'm very glad to hear he's improving. Well, now, I'm sure you all agree with me, its time we went back to the ship. Now, come along.
And the Daleks are not, which is more important, my child.
Why?
But our fate doesn't rest with the Thals, surely. Let's leave well alone. We have ourselves to worry about. Now, come along, come along. Wasting time.
Oh, please, come along. Oh, by the way, let me have the fluid link, will you? Oh, dear boy, now please, please, come along. You know I can't start the ship without it.
Hmm?
No, I can't, my child. And I've looked through all my spares and I've really discovered we do need some mercury.
It's put us in a bit of a jam. I must get that fluid link back again. I'm afraid my little trick has rather rebounded on me. What you might call tempting providence, Chesserman.
Yes, well, at least you're not vindictive.
Hmm?
Yes. Hey? I know that.
I can assure you, young lady, I haven't been wasting my time. There's always a way.
Thank you, my dear. Your faith is something that I prize very highly. You all realise, of course, we cannot succeed against the Daleks alone?
We have a ready-made army here. The Thals. They're strong, and they have one great advantage against the Daleks. They can move so much more quickly.
Well, that's all right, young man. The mind will always triumph. With me to lead them, the Thals are bound to succeed.
My dear child, this is no time for morals. They must fight for us.
Oh, my dear young man, I do hope you're not going to be difficult.
It's just common sense. Young lady, I've been underestimating you.
Are you challenging me?
Quite so.
We need action, not arguments.
Hmm, strange young man.
Yes, we'll see.
Let's see what he's up to.
If we get this intelligent anticipation, we shall succeed. Let's see this. Now, what is this area here?
Yes, yes. Well, now, I suggest we split into two groups. The one to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to try and force a way through the mountains.
Are we all agreed?
Hmm.
Can you see any way in at all?
Oh, you'll allow me, will you?
Yes, yes, yes. Now, the things we have to put out of action is the radio and television waves. They've obviously got complete coverage in and around the city.
We must presume they don't leave anything to chance.
Then we must stop the pictures. Remember, the Daleks aren't very mobile.
And there's always value in surprise. I know it looks difficult, but we must try it, my friends. Yes, we must.
It looks as if my plan has worked.
Never mind. It gives us a better chance to get into the city unnoticed.
Oh, I know it's risky, but, well, we mustn't diddle about here. Now, I want to get to the east side of that antennae.
Hmm?
Yes, yes, I see. Well you go ahead, will you? Go along, child. Yes, we'll show them a thing or two.
Yes?
Ah, yes, a single cable. The whole city is powered by static electricity.
The single wire, you see. Round here, there, see? And there. That must be the answer.
Ah, good girl. Now, just take it over there. That's it. Now, look out.
No, just a minute. Now, you go and tell your friends to stop flashing the light on the antennae. Because for all we know, the Daleks might have a beam to throw on them, paralyse them, kill them.
We shall be all right. Now, go along, and tell them to move their position from time to time. Now hurry, please.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. We shall be back before then. Now go. Dear, dear, dear, that young man gets so agitated. Now, I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll short-circuit it to another conductor. Let me have the key of the ship, Susan, will you? The key of the ship, dear.
Yes, yes, yes. I can always make another one if necessary.
Now, the power's running away. That'll teach the Daleks to meddle in our affairs.
Well, of course.
Watch it.
Now, we've shorted it, you see. So something must have gone somewhere else. The extent of the damage, of course, we don't know yet.
But, my dear child, don't you realise what I've done? A few simple tools
A superior brain.
But, child, look
And you in turn killed the Thal leader in your ambush. And you will be responsible for more deaths unless you help these people.
That's sheer murder.
But you must listen to reason. Please, you must.
You could live in the city and the others could. But why do you have to destroy? Can't you use your brains for right?
What are you planning?
Nothing can live outside if you do that. Nothing.
When do you intend to put this into operation?
This senseless, evil killing.
Just a moment. I haven't told you how we came to this planet.
But it does. I have a ship capable of crossing the barriers of space and time. Surely this would be invaluable to you?
A machine.
But I have.
And you took a part of my ship away from one of my companions. The young man.
A small rod with metal at either end. It belongs to my ship. A fluid link containing mercury. Examine it for yourselves. You will see it's part of a complicated machine.
What if we show you the ship? Explain it to you. Help you to build another?
Yes.
In the petrified forest outside the city.
No.
No. Not unless you stop what you're doing. Otherwise I won't explain its secrets to you and its philosophy of movement.
But you can't operate it without me.
Can they get here in time?
Stop it, please.
Chesterton, come here.
They were about to spread radiation into the air.
Yes.
Even if I wanted to, I don't know how.
No doubt you will have other wars to fight. Chesterton, come along, my boy. We've got work to do. I want to look at the reactors and see if there's any radiation leakage.
Hmm? Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course. Come along. Come along.
This is what they call a compensator, my friend.
The whole of it. It's useless. Throw it away. Forget it. Unless you want to live in a shell like our dead friends.
To rebuild a whole new world. How I envy you.
Oh, no, no. I'm afraid I'm much too old to be a pioneer. Although I was once amongst my own people.
No, no, thank you. We're much too far away from home, my granddaughter and I. Thank you all the same. It's a nice gesture on your part. You know, this soil is not quite so barren as you think. I've been making tests, and even you might live to see and hear the birds amongst the trees. You wanted advice you said. I never give it. Never. But I might just say this to you. Always search for truth. My truth is in the stars and yours is here.
No, I'm afraid it's out of the question. But I might visit your grandchildren to find if they've learned the secrets, and if they have, well, who knows, I might live with them.
Not yet, but I have it safely here. And there's no need to worry about mercury, young man.
Come along, my child. I'm hungry.
Oh, how stupid of me. I very nearly forgot my specimens. Oh, your hand, sir. (shakes it) Goodbye.

Er, no. No, no, still some time distortion.
Date, time and place asked for. How else could you visit your grandfather?
See?
Hmm. Well, we've arrived.
Unexpected aura for a quiet English village.
He's trapped. If there's another fall, he'll be killed.
Hello? Hello!
Wait, please.
Let's have a look around.
Interesting.
Then admire the craftsmanship. Seventeenth century. Probably of a man being chased by the devil. Must admit I've never seen anything quite like it before.
A ghost.
Behave yourselves. We have company.
Too late.
If we're trespassing, I apologise.
Thank you. It's a very impressive room, Colonel.
Seventeenth century.
Now calm down, Tegan. I'm sure we can sort this out.
Tegan, come back! Turlough, fetch her, will you?
Please.
What is going on?
And you're celebrating that?
Hmm. I can understand why.
I'm known as the Doctor.
No more than you are.
Through the woods, via the church.
Hmm, so I'd noticed.
Do you know, I'd love to, but first I must find Tegan and Turlough, and Tegan's grandfather. I gather he's disappeared. Good day!
Turlough! Tegan!
Wait! Come back!
How could he get so far?
Hello? I saw you enter. All I want is Tegan's bag. What have you done with her? I know you can hear me.
Gunpowder.
Who are you? I'm the Doctor.
I won't hurt you.
Show me.
What were you doing in there?
What fighting?
What year is this?
Sixteen hundred and forty three.
Er, yes, Will. Battle's done.
Ah, just in time.
Yes, I know.
Will Chandler.
Ah, well, that's something we're going to have to talk about.
There's been a confusion in time. Somehow 1984 has become linked with 1643.
Psychic projections.
Still a psychic projection, but with substance.
An alien power source.
A projection, too, and at the moment a benign one.
Yes. Ominous, isn't it? As is the fact your grandfather has disappeared. I think it's time I sought some answers.
The village.
Come on, Will. You're coming with me.
You'll be safer in the Tardis. And don't argue. Will!
Look at the others.
Will, in here.
Strange. Will, come and see.
What's the matter? Will? Will, what happened in 1643?
No. No, no. Something else.
The Malus is just a superstition.
Will, tell me what happened? How did it appear?
What did it look like? Like this? Did it look like this?
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Interesting. Come on, Will.
Stay close, Will.
Quickly.
In here.
No, no, just twentieth century men playing a particularly nasty game.
Be grateful. Where do the steps lead?
Yes, Tegan told me.
Just a minute.
It's metal.
It's tinclavic.
The planet Ragga. Let's get back to the church.
Precisely what I said. The Tereleptils mine tinclavic for more or less the exclusive use of the people of Hakol. That's in the star system Rifta, you know.
Well, you take that sample to any metallurgist and they'll confirm it isn't from this planet.
Never more so.
As part of a space vehicle.
Well, more likely a computer-controlled reconnaissance vehicle.
Tell me, was Andrew Verney engaged in any research concerning the Malus?
That's what must have led him to the tunnel and the remains of the Hakol probe.
I believe you, Will. My sincerest apologies for ever doubting you.
That's precisely what Will saw. You see, on Hakol, psychic energy is a force that's been harnessed in much the same way as electricity is here.
The thing you call the Malus was on board the Hakol probe.
No, come and have a look at this.
Yes.
Look at it. Does it look familiar?
Behind you.
Yes. It's interesting, isn't it?
So there you are.
Psychic projection. Over here, Will.
Well, to all intents and purposes he is.
No, Will, come back.
Stand perfectly still.
I told you. It's a psychic projection.
We all learn by our mistakes.
More psychic disturbance.
Ah. It seems he intends to kill us. Make for the underground passage. Run!
I need to speak to Sir George.
Do you know anything about psychic energy?
Then a quick lesson. It can of course occur in many and varied forms, but the type here, capable of creating projections, requires a focus point.
Oh dear, oh dear. A medium.
Yes, a bit more complicated. In this it isn't the medium that's creating the projections, but the Malus. The medium simply gathers all the psychic energy for it to use. And what at the moment is creating the most psychic energy?
The war games.
And who controls the games?
Yes, the trouble is, I don't think he can have any idea of what he's doing. The Malus is pure evil. Given enough energy, it will not only destroy him, but everything else. Cheer up.
Not much further.
That's right.
Long before the Civil War started.
It requires a massive force of psychic energy to activate it. When the Civil War came to Little Hodcombe, it created precisely that.
Yes, in every detail. Tegan's grandfather must have told him everything he discovered. He knows it's the only way for the Malus to be fully activated.
Precisely. The slaughter will be dreadful.
Yes, I know.
Tegan's right. You're energising a force so irresistibly destructive that nothing on Earth can control it. You must stop the war games.
Fluently! Stop the games.
Don't try. He's under the influence of the Malus. Are you with us, Colonel?
Not quite. It's a projection of the parent image, probably one of several energy-gathering points.
Oh, it has no force, yet.
I'm afraid you can't hurt it, Colonel. It has no substance.
We must prevent the reenactment. Spoil it in any way we can. Reduce the amount of psychic energy being produced.
Will there be guards for this procession?
Make sure that Tegan and Jane get safely back to the church. You can use the underground passage. I must search for Turlough and Will, and er, good luck.
Are you all right?
The last time you saw the Malus.
The toast of Little Hodcombe.
That's nothing to what Tegan would have done. Come on.
Over here, Will.
Back to the church, and thank you, Colonel.
Come on, there's still a lot to do.
Hurry.
You didn't close the doors!
This is all we need.
Quietly, now. Don't alarm it.
Well, if I can lock the signal conversion unit onto the frequency of the psychic energy feeding it, I might be able to direct the Malus.
Well, there's a remote chance.
Ah. Perhaps you should close the doors.
It's growing stronger.
It takes time. Excuse me, Colonel.
I know. It senses what I'm about. Now everybody stay perfectly calm and still!
That's it.
Not quite, but it can no longer fuel itself from the turmoil in the village.
Ah. I think it's time we left this thing to die in peace.
So, well done!
Save the greetings until later.
I don't know yet.
They're
The Malus' last line of defence. They'll kill as effectively as any living thing.
They will, in their own time. We're the Malus' last source of psychic energy. It'll make us sweat for as long as it can.
Quiet, Will, quiet.
Not yet, he isn't.
Brave heart, Tegan.
The fight must have used a lot of psychic energy. The Malus needs to rest. Let's go before it recovers.
Forget any codes of honour Sir George might once have held. He's now completely under the control of the Malus.
Not if there's another way.
Sir George, it's important you listen.
Listen to Colonel Wolsey. Concentrate your thoughts. You must break free from the Malus.
You're his slave. He only wants you for one thing.
The Malus is here for one reason. To destroy. It's the only thing it knows how to do.
Without you, the Malus is helpless. Through you it feeds on the fear and anger generated through the war games. Once it's strong enough, it will destroy you.
Listen, Sir George. Your village is in turmoil. You're pointing a gun at a man who's a friend. That's the true influence of the Malus. Can't you feel the hate and rage inside your head? Think, man! Did you have such feelings before you activated that thing?
No!
It's all right, Will. It's all right.
The Malus knows it's lost. It's going to fulfil its programming, Clear the ground, destroy everything it can. Come on!
Quickly! Inside.
Enough to keep Will here and level a church. Come along.
Close the door, would you?
Hold on.
The Malus has destroyed itself.
Oh, a living being, reengineered as an instrument of war and sent here to clear the way for an invasion.
I don't honestly know. I must look to see if there's anything in the computer about it.
Ah, yes, yes. It seems I was mistaken. The Malus was able to intermingle the two time zones for a living being to pass through. Must have had incredible power.
Well, that seems to be it. We'll drop you all off, then we'll be on our way.
Ah, well, him too. 1643 isn't all that far away.
Probably. It isn't unusual. I've had a very hard day.
I'm being bullied, coerced, forced against my will. I've had enough for one day.
All right. Just for a little while. We've a great deal to do.
Oh, a noxious infusion of oriental leaves containing a high percentage of toxic acid.
True. Personally, I rather like it.

From the beginning, she was impossible. The Impossible Girl. I met her in the Dalek Asylum. Never saw her face, and she died. I met her again in Victorian London, and she died. Saved my life both times, by giving her own. But now she's back and we're running together, and she's perfect. Perfect in every way for me. Except she can't remember that we ever met. Clara. My Clara. Always brave, always funny, always exactly what I need. Perfect. Too perfect. Get used to not knowing. I thought I never would. I was wrong. I know who Clara Oswald is. I know how she came to be in my life, and I know what she will always mean. I found out the day we went to Trenzalore.
Yes, what is it? What do you want?
Angie? Artie?
Am I getting warm?
Angie? Artie? Am I getting warm? Am I getting warm?
Am I getting warm? Look, I'm pretty sure you have to tell me if I'm getting warm. I'm, I'm, I'm pretty sure that's in the rules.
Ha! Clara. How are you? Don't worry, everything is under control.
Oh. Mister Maitland went next door, so I said I'd look after the kids. They wanted to go to the cinema, but I said no. I said no, not until you wake up. I was very firm.
Yes. Where are they?
The little Daleks. What's wrong?
An old friend of mine.
Yes, an ex. River asked Vastra for the exact words. What were they?
Sorry. And it was Trenzalore? Definitely Trenzalore?
Oh dear. Sorry.
Trenzalore. I've heard the name, of course. Dorium mentioned it. A few others. Always suspected what it was, never wanted to find out myself. River would know, though. River always knew. Right, come here. Give me your hand. Now, the coordinates you saw will still be in your memory. I'm linking you into the Tardis telepathic circuit. Won't hurt a bit.
I lied.
No.
When you are a time traveller, there is one place you must never go. One place in all of space and time you must never, ever find yourself.
You didn't listen, did you? You lot never do. That's the problem. The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It is discovered. He wasn't talking about my secret. No, no, no, that's not what's been found. He was talking about my grave. Trenzalore is where I'm buried.
Because we all do, somewhere out there in the future, waiting for us.
The trouble with time travel, you can actually end up visiting.
I have to save Vastra and Strax. Jenny too, if it's still possible. They, they cared for me during the dark times. Never questioned me, never judged me, they were just kind. I owe them. I have a duty. No point in telling you this is too dangerous.
Apparently, by breaking into my own tomb.
She's just figured out where we're going. She's against it. I'm about to cross my own timeline in the biggest way possible. The Tardis doesn't like it. She's fighting it. Hang on! Hang on!
She doesn't want to land. She's shut down.
We must be close.
Okay, so that's where I end up.
Always thought maybe I'd retire. Take up watercolours or bee-keeping, or something. Apparently not.
Don't be silly. We fall.
She's turned off practically everything, except the anti-gravs. Guess what I'm turning off.
Oops.
It's more than that. I'm a time traveller. I've probably time-travelled more than anyone else.
Meaning my grave is potentially the most dangerous place in the universe. Shall we?
It's a battlefield graveyard. My final battle.
They're soldiers. The bigger the gravestone, the higher the rank.
It's the Tardis.
No. When a Tardis is dying, sometimes the dimension dams start breaking down. They used to call it a size leak. All the bigger on the inside starts leaking to the outside. It grows. When I say that's the Tardis, I don't mean it looks like the Tardis, I mean it actually is the Tardis. My Tardis from the future. What else would they bury me in?
Well, come on, then.
Who are you talking to? We need to get. River.
No, it can't.
Oh, she's dead, I'm afraid. She's been dead for a very long time.
Long story. But her grave can't be here.
The gravestone?
Yeah, maybe.
Yes, of course. Makes sense. They'd never bury my wife out here.
Catacombs.
Oh well, you know how it is when you lose someone close to you. I sort of made a back-up.
Clara, come on! Run, run!
Come on, quickly, we're in.
Clara!
Yowzah.
Still a bit of a climb. I think I remember the way. Clara? Clara.
Hey, it's okay. You're fine. The dimensioning forces this deep in the Tardis, they can make you a bit giddy.
Clara, it's okay. You're fine.
We can't do this now. The Tardis is a ruin. The telepathic circuits are awakening memories you shouldn't even have.
Why do I keep meeting you?
Clara.
The Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a shipwreck and she died saving my life. And she was you.
Clara.
In Victorian London there was a governess, who was really a barmaid, and she died. And she was you.
Clara? Clara, what's wrong?
That is not a conversation you should even remember.
Run. Run!
Here I am, late to my own funeral. Glad you could make it. Jenny.
No.
I will not open those doors.
I will not open my tomb.
Stop this. Leave them alone.
Please, stop it.
Leave him alone. Let him be.
Please!
I didn't do it. I didn't say my name.
Is everyone all right? Is everyone okay? Clara? Clara? Clara, are you okay?
I know. I'm sorry. Now then, Doctor Simeon, or Mister G Intelligence, whatever I call you, do you know what's in there?
What were you expecting, a body? Bodies are boring. I've had loads of them. Nah, that's not what my tomb is for.
The tracks of my tears.
Time travel is damage. It's like a tear in the fabric of reality. That is the scar tissue of my journey through the universe. My path through time and space from Gallifrey to Trenzalore.
Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the fourth dimension?
Do I have the right?
Daleks, Cybermen, they're still in the nursery compared to us.
There are corners of the universe that have bred the most dangerous things.
You were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
I'm the Doctor. I'm from Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous
Hello, Stonehenge!
My own personal time tunnel. All the days,
It was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen.
Even the ones that I, er, even the ones that I haven't lived yet.
No, no. Which is why I shouldn't be here. The paradoxes. It's very bad.
No. No. No. What are you doing? Somebody stop him!
No, it would destroy you.
It will burn you up. Once you go through, you can't come back. You will be scattered along my timeline like confetti.
No. Please, stop. My life, my whole life is burning.
Please, please, no.
No. Please.
No, Clara.
No. Clara!
Clara!
Yes, what is it? What do you want?
We are not all restored.
I have to get her back.
Clara's got one advantage over the Great Intelligence.
Me.
Now, if I don't come back, and I might not
Go to the Tardis. The fast return protocols should be on. She'll take you home, then shut herself down.
You are always here to me. And I always listen, and I can always see you.
Because I thought it would hurt too much.
No, I thought it would hurt me. And I was right.
Since nobody else in this room can see you, God knows how that looked. There is a time to live and a time to sleep. You are an echo, River. Like Clara. Like all of us, in the end. My fault, I know, but you should've faded by now.
Then tell me, because I don't know. How do I say it?
Well, then. See you around, Professor River Song.
Don't wait up.
Isn't there always?
Okay, how?
Clara. You can hear me. I know you can.
I'm everywhere. You're inside my time stream. Everything around you is me.
Those are my ghosts. My past. Every good day, every bad day.
I'm inside my own time stream. It's collapsing in on itself.
Not until I've got you.
You're my Impossible Girl. I'm sending you something. Not from my past, from yours. Look up. Look.
This is you, Clara. Everything you were or will be. Take it. You blew into the world on this leaf. Hold tight. It will take you home.
Clara! Clara! Come on. Come on, to me, now.
You can do it. I know you can.
Because it's impossible. And you're my Impossible Girl. How many times have you saved me, Clara? Just this once, just for the hell of it, let me save you. You have to trust me, Clara. I'm real. Just one more step.
Clara, my Clara.
Never mind. Let's go back.
He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's get back.
I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor.
Look, my name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise.
Clara? Clara? Clara!
He is my secret.
What I did, I did without choice.
I know.
In the name of peace and sanity.
But not in the name of the Doctor.

I can't take you back, Susan. I can't.
My head.
It hurts here.
No, I was hit on the back of the neck.
No, no, the ship must have stopped and put us down somewhere.
Oh, all these questions, Miss Wright. Please.
What for?
Where is not as important as why, young man. I must go and check the fault locator again.
You didn't touch the controls, did you?
Or you?
I know Susan wouldn't. I'm worried about that child. Temporary lapse of memory.
Well, yes, yes, anything may help.
No, no, no.
No, it's ridiculous.
It's not very logical, is it?
Well, as I said, it's not very logical.
I've been very patient with you, Miss Wright, and really, there's no more time for these absurd theories.
Yes, or electric.
It may even be the main unit. I don't know. I'm very worried about it all. Young man, I think you'll have to help me with that fault locator now that Susan's been put out of action.
Thank you. It won't take us long.
Yes, well, perhaps it would be wiser to check the fault locator first. I'm glad I thought of that. Yes, come along. Come along.
Chesterton!
Oh yes, these numbers keep blurring before my eyes, that's all.
Well if you wouldn't mind standing in front of that indicator and what you will see will be a series of numbers.
Hmm? Are you all right, child?
Hit where?
Yes, rather like mine.
No, it didn't, did it? I must find out what's outside the ship, Susan. Stand close beside me, will you?
No, indeed.
That's very curious. That can't be what's outside the ship. This is a photograph.
Close the door, Susan!
Yes, the planet Quinnis, of the fourth universe.
Did I ever tell you that the ship has a memory bank, hmm?
Are you sure? I thought I did.
Oh, don't you know? I thought you might be able to explain it.
Trying to confuse me, eh?
What is inside, madam, is most important at the moment.
Precisely. I know now who's responsible. You are. You sabotaged my ship.
You're the cause of this disaster. And you knocked both Susan and I unconscious.
A charade. You attacked us.
And when we were lying helpless on the floor, you tampered with my controls.
No, sir. We checked everything. You and I.
Blackmail, that's why. You tried to force me to return you to England.
I know it. I'm sure of it.
Oh, I
But I, I
I've decided we need more time to think. We're all somewhat overwrought. Mister Chesterton. (offers the cups around) Miss Wright. Susan.
A little nightcap to help us relax and sleep.
Meaning?
I'm afraid we have no time for codes and manners. And I certainly don't underestimate the dangers, if they exist. But I must have time to think. I must think. Rash action is worse than no action at all, hmm?
You mean, to keep one jump ahead. That you will never be. You need my knowledge and ability to apply it, and then you need my experience to gain the fullest results.
One man's law is another man's crime. Sleep on it, Chesterton. Sleep on it.
So, it was you?
It's no use pretending.
Help him? You saw him. You saw what he tried to do.
Susan didn't faint. It was you that told me she fainted and I very nearly believed you.
Matter? Matter, young lady? He very nearly tried to strangle me.
Oh, he's play-acting.
Not to me. Nothing's happened to me. This is a plot between the two of you to get control of my ship.
Can't you see I've found you out? Why won't you admit it, hmm?
I told you i'd treat you as enemies.
There's no other way.
That is my business.
There's no alternative. Your little trick endangered our lives.
Oh, it's all a charade.
I see. Divide and conquer, eh? She's trying to poison your mind against me.
Oh, yes, I admit they were very smart.
Don't you see I wouldn't allow them to hurt you, child? They're very resourceful and cunning, and it only leaves me one recourse. They must be put off the ship.
I can and I must.
Don't underestimate my powers, young lady.
Yes, or it might be the Earth in the twentieth century. Hadn't it occurred to you? My ship is very valuable, remember?
Put yourself in my place, young lady, and you'd do precisely the same thing, wouldn't you? Hmm?
You're getting off the ship, Chesterton.
Yes. Now. Get up.
If, of course, they'd like to confess to me what they have done to my ship, I may even change my mind.
The fault locator! The whole of it!
The whole area of the fault locator has just given us a warning.
That's what it means, child.
No, you mustn't be frightened of me. Not now, please. I can't explain, but I've just realised the danger we're in.
Hurry. Look. We must pull him round. You see that panel up there? You've heard me refer to it? The fault locator?
If one small piece of apparatus fails, a little bulb illuminates and tells me precisely where the fault is. Can you imagine what would happen if the whole of it lights up? Hmm? It means that the ship is on the point of disintegration. You're not to blame. All four of us are to blame!
Oh, a mere harmless sleeping drug.
Yes, you rather suspected I was up to some mischief.
I'm afraid I must have misjudged you both.
Well please go on counting. Now both of you listen. Can you concentrate?
We're on the brink of destruction, so all four of us must work closely together. We must find out where we are and what is happening to my ship.
There's a strong force at work somewhere, which is threatening my ship. It's so strong that every piece of equipment can be out of action at the same time.
Precisely. We haven't crash-landed, otherwise I would have discovered that immediately. And I don't believe there's an evil intelligence in the ship. Just at the same token, I don't really believe that you, either of you, have been the cause of this trouble.
I don't know, but we must find out.
But, it's impossible.
Yes. The heart of the machine is under the column.
The source of power. You see, when the column rises, it proves the extent of the power thrust.
Can it be possible then, that this is the end?
We have ten minutes to survive.
Maybe less.
Oh, it's quite safe here. This is where I stood when I tried the scanner switch.
I don't know even where to begin, Chesterton. If only I had a clue.
It? It? What do you mean? My machine can't think.
Yes, it has.
Oh, think not as you or I do, but it must be able to think as a machine. You see, it has a bank of computers.
Yes.
Yes.
I've been racking my brains. I don't know.
Yes, possible.
Well, it would have to be a gigantic one. A one as strong as a solar system.
No, no, it couldn't. If you felt the power, dear boy, you wouldn't live to speak of it. You'd be blown to atoms in a split second.
We'll try it, but we're clutching at straws. Come.
Now, Susan, and you, young lady, should those doors open again, I want you to be standing by them, and tell me whatever it is you see outside, understand?
I lied, deliberately, so that they won't know.
We have five minutes only. When the end does come, they won't know anything about it.
I can't see any. Will you face it with me?
Yes, we must solve this problem, you know. We must.
Yes, then we have the sequence. A planet, a planet in the solar system, getting further away. Blinding flash. Destruction. Yes, of course. It's our journey.
Yes. Yes!
Of course. Of course!
I know. I know. I said it would take the force of a total solar system to attract the power away from my ship. We're at the very beginning, the new start of a solar system. Outside, the atoms are rushing towards each other. Fusing, coagulating, until minute little collections of matter are created. And so the process goes on, and on until dust is formed. Dust then becomes solid entity. A new birth, of a sun and its planets.
I, er, had hoped to reach your planet Earth. Skaro was in the future and I used the fast return switch.
Well, I can't very well see it without a light, can I?
Strange.
Yes, I see. Here it is. (pulls a small torch from his pocket) Here, you see? Now, look, there's the switch. You see?
Well, you merely press it down, and. It's stuck. It hasn't released itself!
Yes, it must have been.
Hold that. Yes, just a minute now. Yes, there you are, you see?
The spring's not connecting. It's come off the base.
There we are. Take it out. Now, luckily we can turn it over and now it should work. There. Ah, that's all right.
Yes, we can all relax. We're quite safe now. But it was a narrow squeak.
Yes, my child?
What happened? It was the switch. It was still in place. You see, there's a little spring inside it and it was stuck. It hadn't released itself.
Well, the switch hadn't broken down, therefore the fault locator couldn't give us any recognition. You see, let me give you a demonstration. (using his torch) Now, look, when I put my thumb on there, the light comes on. And it only stays on so long as my thumb is pressing that switch. As soon as I take if off, a little spring inside releases the switch here and out goes the light.
Precisely. As simple as that. You know, my dear child, I think your old grandfather is going a tiny little bit around the bend. Well, I think you were very brave and I was proud of you.
Yes, I, I, er, well
Really? And I always thought that you were a young man without any recrimination in you. Well, as for you, young lady, well, you were absolutely right. It was your instinct and intuition against my logic, and you succeeded. I mean, the blackouts, and the still pictures and the clock. Well, you read a story into all these things and were determined to hold on to it. We all owe you our lives.
You know, I really believe I have underestimated that young lady in the past, Chartow. Well now, we can all start again, eh? Yes, we can. Yes. But which? Hmm? What are you laughing at, dear boy? Oh, really, you are
I'd like to talk to you, if I may. We've landed on a planet and the air is good, but it's rather cold outside.
Yes, you haven't forgiven me, have you.
Yes, I suppose it's the injustice that's upsetting you, and when I made a threat to put you off the ship it must have affected you very deeply.
As we learn about each other, so we learn about ourselves.
Oh, yes. Because I accused you unjustly, you were determined to prove me wrong. So, you put your mind to the problem and, luckily, you solved it.
Oh, please, yes. Do open the doors, will you?
Oh, by the way, Susan has left you some wearing apparel for outside. You know, we have a very extensive wardrobe here.
Yes, I think they're rather charming. We must look after you, you know. You're very valuable. Yes.
Shall we go?
Oh, good taste.
Well, I think that's absolutely splendid, Chesterton. Yes, it suits you.
Always a trifle too big for me. You know, I acquired that ulster from Gilbert and Sullivan.
Yes, why not.

I don't have any money. But I play.
Yeah.
You're English.
How did you get out here?
Ah.
Magic.
Yeah, from time to time.
Nothing's sad till it's over. Then everything is.
I think that it's called Clara.
Get off my planet.
Get off my planet.
(sotto) Me too.
Could I have a lemonade?
Something like that. (She pours them both a drink from a large pitcher.)
Er, well, sort of Glasgow. Space Glasgow.
Wanted to, yeah.
Every story ever told really happened. Stories are where memories go when they're forgotten.
No, he didn't.
I did.
I know. I came the long way round.
He's not the President any more.
Oh, I've barely started. Tell the High Council they're on the next shuttle.
You're a long way from Karn.
Do you know what they did to me? A confession dial is a ritual act of  purification. It allows a dying Time Lord to face his demons and make  his peace, before his mind is uploaded to the Matrix. It was never intended as a  torture chamber for the living.
Afraid!
And look at him now.
Let's see, shall we?
If you wanted to know about the Hybrid, why didn't you just ask me?
What do you know already?
No.
Which races?
Oh, must be well hard, then.
If they're just stories, why are you so worried?
No.
No.
What colour is it?
Prophecies, they never tell you anything useful, do they?
It's the end of the universe. It's the only time I've got. And you want me to keep you all safe.
I'll need help, obviously.
Oh, not from you lot. No, you'd cramp my style. Look at your hats. I'm  going to need the use of an extraction chamber, to talk to an old  friend.
This way. I can save you.
Yeah.
No. This is a planet.
Basically, my place.
Forget about that. It doesn't matter.
Yeah.
My place.
Yeah.
Gallifrey.
Well, we're several billion years in the future and the universe is pretty much over, so, yeah, quite a lot.
Nothing.
It's a side effect.
Clara, there's a sound you've been living with every day of your life, but you've learned not to hear.
Your heartbeat. Your physical processes have been time looped. Frozen  between one heartbeat and the next. Even your breathing is just a habit. You don't need it.
Because the Time Lords are very clever. It doesn't matter.
I'll try not to break your jaw.
I wasn't talking to you.
No, General, I don't know that. Everybody, stay exactly where you are!  No moving about. On pain of death, no-one take a selfie!
So are you.
I will not let Clara die.
Regeneration?
Good luck.
I want a neural block. Human compatible. Quickly! Come on!
Come on, quick!
Why do you say that?
It was him or you.
Yeah? Well, the difference is, when you die, you stay dead.
We're on Gallifrey. Death is Time Lord for man flu.
Well, they must have unfrozen it and come back.
I didn't ask. It would make them feel clever.
Happy?
Never mind. This way.
There was only one way to keep Clara safe. I had to wipe some of her memory.
Of me.
The Cloister Wraiths. Sliders, we used to call them. They guard the Matrix. We're safe in here.
They only attack if you make any attempt to leave.
Or, actually, if you try to stay.
Starting to, yeah, a bit.
This way, I'm fairly sure. According to the stories, there's a secret way out. If you find it, the Sliders let you go.
It's okay. It's okay, look at it.
Don't worry, it's been neutralised. Those aren't vines. In your terms,  they're fibre-optic cables, they're alive and growing. We're inside the biggest database in history. Sometimes, people are  stupid enough to break in.
It's a database. They get filed.
Probably a leftover from the Cloister Wars. There's nothing we can do. Come on.
Keep away from them! The Matrix can use them as a defence. It means the secret exit must be close.
It's not just a crypt. More like a stone circuit board. This is the Matrix database.
Oh.
Oh.
Looks like the primary service hatch. Just have to work out the key.
Oh.
When Time Lords die, their minds are uploaded to a thing called the  Matrix. This structure, it's like a living computer. It can predict the  future, generate prophecies out of algorithms, ring the Cloister bells in the event of  impending catastrophe. The Sliders, they're just like the guard dogs,  the firewall. Projections from inside the Matrix itself. The dead, manning the  battlements.
The Time Lords have got a big computer made of ghosts, in a crypt, guarded by more ghosts.
Tiny bit.
All computers do that in the end. You wait until the internet starts. Oh, that was a war!
A long time ago, there was a student at the Academy. He got in here,  disappeared for four days. Showed up in a completely different part of  the city. Said the Sliders talked to him, they showed him the secret passage out.  And we just need the code.
Ah, no, he didn't tell anyone anything. He went completely mad. Never right in the head again, so they say.
The last I heard, he stole the moon and the President's wife.
Ah, well, that was a lie put about by the Shabogans. It was the  President's daughter. I didn't steal the moon, I lost it.
I was a completely different person in those days. Eccentric, a bit mad, rude to people.
Sorry, what?
What? What is it?
Oh, ffr, I'm not sure.
I was stuck on a place. They
They wanted something from me. Information. It really doesn't matter.
I changed it.
Well, I can't be the Doctor all the time.
I think I've almost got it. I think this is it.
Twenty feet of pure diamond.  Harder than diamond.
But you break through anything, given time.
It doesn't matter what the Hybrid is. It only matters that I convinced  them that I knew. Otherwise they'd have kicked me out, I'd have had nothing left to bargain with.
What do you think? You. I had to find a way to save
It was fine.
If she says so.
I had a duty of care. Listen, I'm nearly through here. (burble, clang) If I'm right,  there should be a service duct under here. We'll be able to get to the  old workshops. They'll have Tardises there.
We do not have time.
Time machine. I backed up a bit.
After all this time, after everything I've done, don't you think the universe owes me this?
Since when is hope a bad thing?
What do you think of the new wheels?
Classic! Look at the colour scheme.
Genius! (jolt) Check your  heartbeat again. I think that you'll find you have one.
It should have restarted when we broke free of Gallifrey's time zone.  You're alive! Now we just have to shake off the Time Lords. There's only one place we can do that. What do you say to lunch,  followed by breakfast? Because we're time travellers and that's how we  roll. Then cocktails with Moses. Then I'm going to invent a flying submarine.  Why? Because no one ever has and it's annoying. And maybe we should use this Tardis to find my proper one. I need to change my shirt.
Oh, you just haven't found it yet. Try again.
Er, maybe we just have to fly a little bit further, give it a bit more welly.
Oh, they're exaggerating. They exaggerate all the time. History will be fine. Time will heal. It always does.
Yeah. It'll sort itself out. It'll be all right. You'll have a heartbeat. Or don't you trust me any more?
Nowhere in space, forward in time. We're going to the last hours of the  universe. We're going long past where the Time Lords were hiding. Literally, to the end. They won't be able to track us there. We'll just  be there for a minute. I just need to. I need to make an adjustment.
It's nothing, really. It's this.
We don't have to stay here long. Er check your heartbeat again. Your  timeline must have started by now. A pulse, yeah? You have a pulse, yes?  Pulse? Let me do it.
This should work. This has got to work.
The universe is over! It doesn't have a say any more! We're standing on  the last ember, the last fragment of everything that ever was. As of this moment, I'm answerable to no-one!
Four knocks. It's always four knocks.
No. This one I do alone.
Me.
I told you once, so long ago, that the universe would become a very  small place when I'm angry with you. Small enough for you yet?
Hello, me.
At the end of everything, we should expect the company of immortals, so I've been told.
The one and only me. Finally, you earn the title, sitting here  in a reality bubble at the end of Time itself. How are you sustaining  it, by the way?
No. It was sad.
You killed her.
You let it happen.
Ashildr
Me, go to hell. By my calculations, you've got about five minutes.
Because it's fun.
Of course it can. Of course it can. You just have to steal a time machine.
I don't know. I don't remember it.
Oh, but that's easy. That's very, very easy. The Hybrid is you.
No, it isn't.
The actual prophecy specifies only two warrior races. The Daleks and the  Time Lords have made assumptions, of course. And they would. Humans and the Mire, both warrior races. It fits perfectly.
Do you have a better one?
That's your best theory? I'm the Hybrid? I ran away from Gallifrey  because I was afraid of myself? That doesn't make any sense.
Does it matter?
Really?
Two?
She's my friend. She's just my friend.
Missy.
Clara's my friend.
Nothing. Nothing at all. I know I went too far. I get it. That's why I'm doing what I'm doing.
I'm taking her back to Earth. Somewhere safe, somewhere out of the way.  I'm going to wipe her memory of every last detail of me.
It'll be like our friendship never happened.
'I've done it before. Usually, I do it telepathically, but this time, I've got something better.
It's quite painless.
Of course.
Now.
You okay?
Yeah, we'll fix that somehow. I promise. You remember Ashildr, of course.
I thought you'd be more surprised to see her.
It won't hurt, it'll be nothing. You'll just pass out for a moment.
When you wake, you'll be fine.
Clara, just listen to me.
When you wake up, you will have forgotten me. You'll have forgotten we ever even met.
Because it's the only way. That stuff in your head, the image of me, they could use it to find you.
On what?
What did you do?
Tell me what you did.
You were trying to trick me?
I'm trying to keep you safe.
Oh, Clara Oswald. What am I doing? You're right. You're always, always right.
I'm not sure you managed to reverse the polarity. I'm not even sure  that you can. It'll do something to one of us. Better than flipping a  coin.
You and me together. Look how far I went, for fear of losing you. This has to stop. One of us has to go.
Let's find out. Let's do it like we've done everything else. Together.
Oh, that'd be great, wouldn't it?
Good luck, Clara.
I suppose, we just, er, we just wait a minute, I suppose.
Clara, I don't think you're ever going to have to.
Run like hell.
Run like hell, because you always need to. Laugh at everything, because it's always funny.
Never be cruel and never be cowardly. And if you ever are, always make amends.
Never eat pears. They're too squishy and they always make your chin wet. That one's quite important. Write it down.
It's okay. It's okay. I went too far. I broke all my own rules. I became the Hybrid. This is right. I accept it.
Smile for me. Go on, Clara Oswald, one last time.
It's okay. Don't you worry. I'll remember it.
Where am I?
How did I get here?
Clara?
Clara? Clara who?
When something goes missing, you can always recreate it by the hole it  left. I know her name was Clara. I know we travelled together. I know that there was an Ice Warrior on a submarine and a mummy on the  Orient Express. I know we sat together in the Cloisters and she told me something very important, but I have no idea what she  said. Or what she looked like. Or how she talked. Or laughed. There's nothing there. Just nothing.
I'm trying.
There's one thing I know about her. Just one thing. If I met her again,  I would absolutely know.
Stupid Doctor. Amy and Rory. It was Amy and Rory.
No. Somebody's moved it from London. I'm still looking. But this diner. It  wasn't always here, was it? It used to be on the other side of the hill.
I don't remember a single thing about it.
That would be nice.

We'll have that instead. Run!
Anyone inside that house is dead. If you want to help, then don't let her die for nothing. You've got to come with us right now.
Rose, she's not your mother.
Come on.
Little bit of technology from my home.
It's on a revitalising loop. It'll charge back up in about four hours.
Talk about executions, you'll make me your enemy. And take some really good advice. You don't want to do that.
Good policy. I do much the same. I'm the Doctor, by the way, if anyone's interested.
Cybermen. They're called Cybermen. And I'd take those ear pods off, if I were you. You never know. Lumic could be listening.
But he's overreached himself. He's still just a businessman. He's assassinated the President. All we need to do is get to the city and inform the authorities. Because I promise you, this ends tonight.
It's the ear-pods. Lumic's taken control.
Don't! Cause a brainstorm. Human race. For such an intelligent lot, you aren't half susceptible. Give anyone a chance to take control and you submit. Sometimes I think you like it. Easy life.
I don't know. Lumic must have a base of operations.
Ah, there are Cybermen in our universe. They started on an ordinary world just like this, then swarmed across the galaxy. This lot are a parallel version, and they're starting from scratch right here on Earth.
There!
Go.
We can mourn him when London is safe. But now, we move on.
The whole of London's been sealed off, and the entire population's been taken inside that place. To be converted.
Oh, I'll think of something.
Yep. But I do it brilliantly.
We go under there and up into the control centre?
You'd have to show no emotion. None at all. Any sign of emotion would give you away.
No stopping you, is there?
Tell you what. We can take the ear pods at the same time. Give people their minds back so they don't walk into that place like sheep. Jakey-boy? Lumic's transmitting the control signal. It must be from over there.
There it is. On the zeppelin, you see? Great big transmitter. Good thing Lumic likes showing off. Reckon you could take it out?
Mrs Moore, would you care to accompany me into the cooling tunnels?
We attack on three sides. Above, between, below. We get to the control centre, we stop the conversion machines.
Mickey. You can er
Mickey. Good luck.
If we survive this, I'll see you back at the Tardis.
Good luck.
Any sign of a light switch?
Ooo!
Haven't got a hotdog in there, have you? I'm starving.
I know. It's the Cyberman of food, but it's tasty.
Let's see where we are.
Already converted, just put on ice. Come on.
Let's go slowly. Keep an eye out for trip systems.
How did you get into this, then, rattling along with the Preachers?
What about Mr Moore?
Oh, who needs family? I've got the whole world on my shoulders. Go on, then. What's your real name?
Not a word.
It's just the torchlight. Keep going, come on.
They're waking up. Run!
Come on! Come on!
Oh, good team, Mrs Moore.
What the hell was that thing?
You figured right. Now, let's have a look. Know your enemy. A logo on the front. Lumic's turned them into a brand. Heart of steel, but look.
Hmmm. Central nervous system. Artificially grown then threaded throughout the suit so it responds like a living thing. Well, it is a living thing. Oh, but look. Emotional inhibitor. Stops them feeling anything.
It's still got a human brain. Imagine its reaction if it could see itself, realise itself inside this thing. They'd go insane.
Because they have to.
We broke the inhibitor. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Can you remember your name?
It's all right. You sleep now, Sally. Just go to sleep.
Sally Phelan didn't die for nothing, because that's the key. The emotional inhibitor. If we could find the code behind it, the cancellation code, then feed it throughout the system into every Cyberman's head, they'd realise what they are.
I think it would kill them. Could we do that?
No! No, you didn't have to kill her!
I've been captured, but don't worry, Rose and Pete are still out there. They can rescue me. Oh well, never mind. You okay?
Then where is he, the famous Mister Lumic? Don't we get the chance to meet our Lord and Master?
So he's just like you?
That's my friends at work. Good boys! Mister Lumic, I think that's a vote for free will.
And imagination? What about that? The one thing that lead you here, imagination, you're killing it dead!
I'm the Doctor.
Yeah, but that's it. That's exactly the point! Oh, Lumic, you're a clever man. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. But everything you've invented, you did to fight your sickness. And that's brilliant. That is so human. But once you get rid of sickness and mortality, then what's there to strive for, eh? The Cybermen won't advance. You'll just stop. You'll stay like this forever. A metal Earth with metal men and metal thoughts, lacking the one thing that makes this planet so alive. People. Ordinary, stupid, brilliant people.
Oh, yes.
Yes. Yes I have.
Oh, yes.
You might as well kill me.
It's not yours to take. You're a Cyber Controller. You don't control me or anything with blood in its heart.
You just don't get it, do you? An army's nothing. Because those ordinary people, they're the key. The most ordinary person could change the world.
Some ordinary man or woman, some idiot. All it takes is for him to find, say,
The right numbers. Say the right codes. Say, for example, the code behind the emotional inhibitor. The code right in front of him.
Because even an idiot knows how to use computers these days.
Knows how to get past firewalls and passwords. Lnows how to find something encrypted in the Lumic Family Database, under er. What was it, Pete? Binary what?
An idiot could find that code. Cancellation code.
And he'd keep on typing.
Keep on fighting. Anything to save his friends.
Yeah, talk too much, that's my problem. Lucky I got you that cheap tariff, Rose, for all our long chats.
On your phone.
Yes. Delete, control, hash. All those lovely buttons. Then, of course, my particular favourite, send. And let's not forget how you seduced all those ordinary people in the first place.
By making every bit of technology compatible with everything else.
Like this.
I'm sorry.
I gave them back their souls. They can see what you've done, Lumic, and it's killing them!
There's no way out!
Rose, get up.
Pete! Take this! Use it! Hold the button down! Press it against the rope. Just do it!
Rose? I've only got five minutes of power. We've got to go.
My suit! Good man. Now then, Jake, we've got to run. But one more thing. Mrs Moore. Her real name was Angela Price. She's got a husband out there, and children. Find them. Tell them how she died saving the world.
Off we go, then.
You're doing what?
We can't. I told you, travel between parallel worlds is impossible. We only got here by accident. We, we fell through a crack in time. When we leave, I've got to close it. We can't ever return.
Take Rose's phone. It's got the code. Get it out there. Stop those factories. And good luck, Mickey the idiot.
Far away. That was far away.
He's gone home.

Oh, come on, Jo, be reasonable.
Well, we didn't hit it, did we?
Well, by a rather brilliant last minute course correction, I've managed to materialise the Tardis inside the spaceship. But to avoid hitting it, I've had to make a random jump back into normal space.
Well, if I'm going to get us back to Earth, I'd better find out where we are. I'll just go and check the instruments.
What?
Well, I think I know where we are.
And I've got a pretty good idea about when.
Look at what?
Well, it's just a space ship, Jo. You know, I reckon we must be somewhere in the twenty sixth century. Well, interstellar travel's pretty routine by now.
Mmm?
Well, I did hear something, but very faintly. Come on, Jo. Let's go and find the crew. I want to find the exact date for my calculations.
What?
Well, that's interesting. They must be going to do a link up.
Well, the two ships are joined together by a sort of tunnel, you see, with two airlocks. Well, then they equalise the pressure allowing the crew to move from one ship to the other without using spacesuits. Well, otherwise they'd have to get all kitted up and do a space walk.
Look, Jo, don't worry. We'll be on our way soon. Now let's go and take look at the ship's calendar.
Ah, how do you do? I'm sorry about this intrusion.
I said, how do you do?
Gun? I haven't got a gun. This is simply my hand.
Jo, what's the matter with you?
Nonsense, it's simply a man with a gun. Now pull yourself together.
I'm not sure, Jo. Something rather intriguing.
Oh, so that's what it's all about.
Look
Well, that's the way they see us, I suppose.
It's got to be some non-human life form. Something that they're frightened of. Dragons. Dragons. Yes, of course, Draconians.
Well, if this is the period that I think it is, there are two great empires spreading their way through the galaxy of the Milky Way.
Those were the declining years of Earth's planetary empire. This is just the beginning. Now Earth and Draconia are both been expanding, you see. Colonising one planet after another, and they're sitting on a powder keg.
No, Draconians. No, Dragons is rather an unflattering nickname. Well, you remember that sound you heard?
And the man that you saw with the gun?
No, you didn't, Jo. That sound made you see what you fear most.
Well, it shouldn't be too difficult. Ultrasonics geared to stimulate the fear centres of the brain, something like that.
Well, difficult to say. It seems to act like a sort of post-hypnotic command. It'll fade eventually, of course.
Why indeed.
Well, that's one consolation, isn't it?
There we go.
I'm reversing the polarity of my ultrasonic screwdriver's power source, thereby converting it into an extremely powerful electromagnet.
You wait and see, Jo.
Yes, I think so.
Nearly there. There you are - that's it.
Oh, how very embarrassing. Good afternoon.
Well, they haven't boarded yet. They're still breaking through that door. Now, try and be logical, man.
Back to the Tardis, Jo. Back!
Jo?
Jo?
All right, Jo, what are you doing in there?
Must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun. I wonder why they didn't kill me? What exactly happened, Jo?
Mmm?
Oh.
Well, try and get the Tardis back, of course. Why should the Ogrons attack this ship?
No. No, there's more to it than that. That sound that you heard, it's all too sophisticated for the Ogrons.
Yeah, the question is, where?
No, not necessarily. No, the Ogrons are mercenaries. Other life forms use them to do their dirty work. Come on, Jo, let's go and find the crew.
Jo, take a look at that one. Well, they're both stunned, just as I was. That's funny. The Ogrons have repaired the airlock door.
Well, if they hadn't, we'd have both been done for. All the air would have escaped when the ships unlocked.
Well, maybe they've got kind hearts. There's good in everyone you know, Jo.
Look after them, will you?
Hello battle cruiser, battle cruiser. This is the cargo ship. Over.
The ship has been attacked and the cargo stolen. Over.
Yes, the crew are stunned, but otherwise they're unharmed. Over.
It's all right, Jo. We're being rescued.
Don't worry, old chap. You'll be all right now. I think
Passengers.
Including some rather valuable property of mine.
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, we're here, aren't we?
I was merely trying to avoid a lot of tiresome explanations, old chap.
Now, if you'll only listen to me
Listen. The ships, they're unlocking.
That's what he's there for, isn't it.
And then what?
Jo, this ship's already going back to Earth.
Look, Jo
Will you stop pacing up and down like a perishing panda. Now come and sit down. Let me think, will you? That's better.
Because the true facts have been erased from their minds, that's why.
They don't know that they're lying, Jo. They're desperately trying to fit us into their version of things.
Well, when we get back to Earth, we've got to reach someone in authority whose mind isn't already closed.
Jo, look, these people believe that the Draconians are attacking their spaceships, right?
And we know that they're wrong, don't we?
Well, we also know that the Ogrons couldn't possibly have created that hallucinatory device that makes the Earthmen think they're Draconians.
Right.
Well, twelve minutes to be exact, Jo.
I'd like to get a message through to your President.
Yes?
Oh, you don't want to worry about those things, Jo. As long as you tell them the truth, they can't do you any harm.
No, of course not. Well, they're only sort of computers with a few extra knobs on. And you know how stupid computers can be, don't you? Now come and sit down, stop worrying. Come on. Sit down. Did I ever tell you the story about how I was once captured by the Medusoids?
Medusoids? How can I describe them to you? Well, they're a sort of hairy jellyfish with claws, teeth and a leg.
Anyway, they put me under one of these mind probes things, you see, and tried to get me to tell them where I was going. So, I said I was on my way to meet a giant rabbit, a pink elephant and a purple horse with yellow spots.
Well, the poor old machine just couldn't believe it, had a nervous breakdown.
Well, they put me under another one of these mind probe things and the same thing happened.
A purple horse with yellow spots. Yes, I was. You see, they were all delegates for the third Intergalactic Peace Conference.
Well they had to turn me loose eventually.
They ran out of mind probes.
Madam, I can assure that I've never been employed by anybody. Least of all by the Draconians.
If we really were working for the Draconians, why did they leave us in your ship?
Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally closed mind that I've ever encountered. Madam, I beg of you to listen to me. Some third party is trying to provoke war between Earth and Draconia. You are both being duped.
I've no idea, Madam, but believe me, that is what is happening.
Now please listen to me! If you don't you'll be involved in a war that could cause the death of millions!
I've got to get them to listen to me, for their sakes as well as ours.
Well, that was a Draconian with the President, you know. Obviously an Ambassador of some kind.
Well, clearly Earth and Draconia are on the brink of war, and they both believe it's the others fault.
Well, I can but try. Yeah, seems a fairly conventional type of electronic lock. Rather old-fashioned really. Here goes.
Yes, well, I think we'll sit here for a while after all.
Why?
Not unless you give me some good reason.
Are you sure it's the President and not another ridiculous interrogation.
Come on, Jo, Perhaps we can convince them after all.
Move, Jo! Get up and run!
Well, I must say it's very nice of you gentlemen to invite me here. And where is Miss Grant?
Don't you realise what you've done? You've now finally convinced them that we're both Draconian agents.
My dear chap, I've already been through all this with the President of Earth. She thinks I'm working for you.
I'm what?
Yes, I couldn't agree with you more. That's exactly what I've been trying to say to you. The Earth cargo ship was not attacked by Draconians.
I can assure you that it was attacked, but by Ogrons.
Yes. Some third party's employing them trying to make trouble between Earth and Draconia.
My dear chap, nobody is more devoted to the cause of peace than I am. But I cannot tell you something that I don't know.
Don't you realise you're completely on the wrong tack? There is a plot, yes, but the Earthmen are not behind it any more than you are.
Hello, Jo.
I've been paying a brief but unwilling visit to the Draconian embassy. And I'm afraid I had to leave in rather a hurry and found myself back here.
Well, believe it or believe it not, Jo, they think we're working for General Williams and trying to provoke a war.
Yes, Earth is blaming Draconia and Draconia is blaming Earth.
That's about it. What's the matter?
Get down. That was close.
You can suit yourself. But I warn you, you're wasting your time.
No.
I came here in my own ship, the Tardis.
Yes, my own spaceship.
I didn't. In any case, it wasn't the Draconians, it was the Ogrons.
I wouldn't do that, old man. I know these machines. They aren't awfully reliable, you know.
There's just no telling some people, is there, my dear.
No.
They don't.
In the Tardis.
No one.
I don't know.
I'm telling you the truth.
Mmm hmm. Apart from a bit of a headache. I like the new outfit. Who are you fighting tonight? What happened to you, anyway?
Yes, awkward, isn't it? Well, they've made up their minds, you see. They'll only believe us if we tell them what they want to hear. It's a pity really that the Ogrons didn't succeed in kidnapping us. Perhaps we should have been more helpful.
Well, if they had succeeded, presumably they'd have taken us to where the Tardis is. I'm sorry, Jo. I'm afraid another kidnapping attempt is our only ray of hope.
That's about it, yes.
See you later.
Madam President. I've been telling you the truth for some considerable time, but you just won't believe me.
Well, that's very generous of you, Madam, but you'd only be buying information that doesn't exist.
What, without a trial? Without even a chance to state my case? So, you're just tucking me quietly away, are you? What about my companion?
But you will see that she comes to no harm?
I'd like to, Madam. I really would, but there's nothing that I can say that you'd believe. May I say goodbye to her?
Oh, it's a long story. I don't think you'd believe me even if I told you.
Not particularly, no.
Have you got many political prisoners here?
Well, you might put it like that, yes. Yes, I tried to stop a war.
Did you? How long is your sentence?
Now that's stealing, you know.
That's what I'm in for.
Good, I'm glad to hear it.
I thought you said there were no common criminals here?
Don't any of you try to escape?
It seems a perfectly natural question.
Including planning to escape?
Oh, why? Doesn't anybody ever try?
No. No, quite so. But there's got to be a first time for everything, hasn't there? Come on, Professor, come and tell me all you know about the layout here.
Is this all we get?
Mmm, and absolutely nothing to make it enjoyable, eh?
Not exactly friendly, are they.
No. Tell me, Professor, when do you plan to escape?
But you're going to try?
If I were, I'd hardly be drawing attention to myself quite so quickly, now would I?
You've little or no alternative, Professor. We're all in this sector together. Whatever you do, I shall know about it.
Oh, I was sent here at the express wish of a certain General Williams.
I'll tell you something. There is a conspiracy to start a war between Earth and Draconia.
But there's also a third party, Professor, who is plotting to set the two empires at each others throats.
Well, there you are. There you have it. That's how I came to be here.
Good grief. Do you know, sir, you're the first person who's believed me?
What is it? What's up?
Come on, Professor. Come on. You were giving off conspiracy in waves over there. You can trust me, you know.
Who are you taking with you?
Well that's very generous of you, but
Well, it was telling my story on Earth that got me sent here in the first place.
Thank you, Professor. You don't know what it means to me to have found allies at last.
Take this one?
Tell me, Professor, why is Cross helping you?
That's extraordinary. I would have thought he would have wanted something far more positive than promises.
What's that? I thought I heard something.
All right.
Well, this one's empty.
Well, it certainly is. Take a look for yourself. There, look at the gauge. Yes, and so is this one. They're both empty, Professor.
The door. It's locked!
They're depressurising. Don't you understand, man? They're pumping out the air!
They certainly won't if we don't try.
Professor, don't shout. You'll just waste oxygen.
Come on, Professor, come on. Come on, up you get.
Listen. Listen, it worked!
You. Yes, I might have guessed.
It was a deliberate attempt at cold-blooded murder, Governor. And I demand an enquiry.
I also believe there was a conspiracy to destroy this man because he's politically dangerous to you.
With no oxygen in the cylinders.
And I take it we that also locked ourselves in the airlock from the outside and switched off the air supply?
And may I ask what I'm supposed to have done there?
I seem to be quite the master criminal, don't I? You don't mean to say that you really believe all this nonsense, do you, Governor? Whatever credentials that he's shown you are forged.
Hello, Jo.
How are you? All right?
You know, I'd very much like to know why?
No. Why I'm still alive.
Yes, well whatever it is you're up to, you needn't expect any help from me.
Stolen, of course?
Er, may I ask where we're going?
Right, now listen to me. We haven't got much time before he gets back to the flight deck. Now, the first thing we've got to do is to escape. Now they took my sonic screwdriver from me in the prison, but they didn't get a hold of this.
A steel file.
No, not yet. Let's wait until he gets back to the flight deck, then he'll set the controls. Now, this is an automatic spaceship. Once we're underway, the computers take over, right?
Now this is what we're going to do.
So I told the High Council of the Time Lords. I said they had absolutely no right to put me on trial in the first place. Well, if I chose to go wandering around the universe in my own time
That was my business.
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it. I fully intended to return it, I assure you. Anyway, she wasn't exactly the latest model, poor old thing.
I'll tell you, I made a complete fool of that prosecuting council, though. I ridiculed his every argument. Yes, and I told him that I had the complete answer to every one his charges against me.
Then what happened. Well, they found me guilty, changed my appearance and exiled me to Earth.
That's right. That's where I met you. And that alone made the exile worth while, Miss Grant.
Not that there's anything wrong with Earth. Well, it's quite a nice little planet in its own way, but after all, I am a Time Lord, Jo, and I think I deserve my freedom.
As I soon realised, the trouble with Lethbridge Stewart is that he's got a military mind.
No, that's the trouble though. He's hidebound, you see. He always does everything by the rules. I keep telling him. I said, there are times, you know, when you've simply got to cut right through the red tape.
Yes, I've managed to cut right through it.
And I'm not going to let authority stand between me and my freedom.
Oh, no you don't!
Hello. We appear to have company.
Would these be your Ogron friends?
Well, I should try and be a bit more hospitable, old chap. Come on, put that gun away. They've probably got us outnumbered.
Now don't believe this man. He's lying.
Captain, you cannot condemn us without a trial. Now I have vital information for your Emperor. At least give me the chance to speak to him.
Well, personally I'm quite happy to be going to Draconia, Jo. Perhaps we can convince the Emperor what our friend here has been trying to do.
Well, this won't be my first visit to Draconia, you know? Many years ago, I spent quite some time there. I was able to help them through a period of very great difficulty.
Well, it's a long time ago. Things may have changed. But I do understand the Draconian mentality, Jo. It all depends how you approach them.
We'll wake you with a cup of tea in the morning.
Well, that's it then. Come on, we've landed.
He's awake already. He's just trying to show us how unconcerned he is.
May I have permission to address the Emperor?
My life at your command, sire.
Ah, but I am a noble of Draconia. The honour was conferred on me by the fifteenth Emperor.
Your Majesty, this man that you speak of, was he not known as the Doctor? And did he not come to this planet in a spaceship called the Tardis?
Well, I am that man, sire. And I come from a race of people that live far longer than any Earthman.
It is true, your Majesty. I did come here as a prisoner, but I came willingly, in order to warn you that this man is plotting a war between Earth and Draconia.
Ah, but the Master is not an Earthman. I'm sorry to have to admit it, but he's a renegade of my own race, and he's using creatures called Ogrons to attack your spaceships and those of the Earthmen.
I'm sorry, but there you are in error, sir. Your people have seen Ogrons, but they appear to them as Earthmen because of a hypnotic device.
A wise decision, your Majesty. For only by Earth and Draconia working together can we hope to arrive at the truth.
You feeling all right, old chap?
Your Majesty, I beg of you to be cautious. Something is seriously wrong here. This ship that has just landed. I beg you, place it under guard immediately.
Your Majesty, look down here and tell me. What do you see?
Jo? Jo, can you still hear that sound?
Your Majesty, I beg of you. Please look again.
Why does the Master want war between Earth and Draconia?
You'd only be wasting your time. The Ogrons have got the finest defence mechanism of all. Stupidity. They haven't got a mind for you to probe.
And fear breeds hatred, your Majesty. Fear is the greatest enemy of them all, for fear leads us to war.
The Prince is right, your Majesty. We must mount an expedition at once, and we must take the Ogron as evidence.
Hello, Jo. How's your Ogron friend?
We're just about to cross the frontier into Earth space.
Well, this is an Earth police spaceship, you know, sir.
Well, it looks like another spaceship. It appears to be following us.
They're closing in. Perhaps it's a frontier patrol ship coming to investigate us.
We can try. We should be within audio range. Hello, this is Earth police spaceship two three nine oh on a special mission to the President of Earth. Do you read me, do you read me? Over.
This is Earth police spaceship two three nine oh on a special mission to the President of Earth. Do you read me, do you read me? Over.
Hello, Earth police spaceship one four two. (sotto) I think there'll be trouble over this. (normal) Hello, we've recaptured this ship and are taking it back to Earth. Over.
Yes, but they, unfortunately, didn't know that, did they? Hello, Earth police spaceship, we are reducing speed as you request, over.
Yes, exactly. That's why I want to get them into visual scanner range.
We should be able to pick them up on the visual scanner now.
Hold tight! I'm taking evasive action.
They're still after us.
No. No, I'm afraid we're outgunned. This isn't a battlecruiser, you know.
Hang on. I think we're shaking them off. (The Ogron enters.)
He's broken out! Get out, Jo!
Right, there you are, my friend.
We've been boarded! We need the blasters. Come on!
Don't worry about him. He's no use to us at the moment.
Get down!
We should be all right in a minute. The ship'll pump in more oxygen.
Hello, this is Earth police spaceship two three nine oh on a special mission to the President of Earth. Over.
Look, it's of vital importance that you pursue and capture that ship immediately. Over.
Look, you don't understand. The man who stole this ship is escaping in that vessel.
Oh, very well. We're standing by.
Then we must mount an expedition to the planet of the Ogrons. The proof we need is there, Madam.
My dear chap, I'm not asking for a battlefleet. All I require is one small spaceship.
Then can I take it, sir, that you will now authorise the expedition?
Your Royal Highness, could you convince your people they were not being attacked by Earthmen?
We'd better leave at once. Madam President.
Right, thirty-four seconds. A course correction to galactic coordinates two three four nine, six seven eight four.
Well, not completely uninhabited, General Williams. That's where the Ogron's planet is.
Certainly. From the Master. He fed the coordinates into his ship's computer when I was his prisoner. And after you'd captured the ship, sir, I extracted the information from the ship's memory banks.
Somehow I don't think they're in the mood for explanations at this minute. Can you outrun them?
Right, we're out of range now.
Well, we were infringing Draconian space, after all, your Royal Highness.
Do you know exactly what's wrong?
Right, well, you hold her steady. I'll go and effect the repairs.
Naturally.
A bit of a shambles, I'm afraid. Though I'll do my best to bodge something up.
I've no idea, old chap.
I know. I'm on the outside.
I'm being as quick as I can.
Right, I'm coming in now.
Pilot, can you get her into a closer orbit?
Well, we'll just have to risk it. We can't see anything from up here.
Can you boost it up?
Jo must have fixed up some kind of homing device.
Doesn't it strike you as being a bit too convenient?
Can you get her down?
Williams, look. Another one.
Yes. Well, let's hope we don't encounter one.
I've no idea, old chap. We'll find out when we get there. Come on, can't be far.
I've no idea, but whatever it is, it's on our side.
That's good. It's started again. Come on.
I don't know. I've got a feeling. Some sort of premonition.
Yes, come on.
No, he's unarmed.
No! No, don't. It's no good.
Oh, I suppose I should thank you for saving my life?
Hello, Jo.
Because war will mean the extermination of both empires, your Royal Highness, and the Daleks will emerge as the supreme rulers. Now somehow, we've got to get out of here and stop them.
Well done, Jo!
There is one thing we can do, though, and it'll need a very slight adjustment.
General Williams, if we do manage to get out of here, and Jo and I manage to create a diversion, could you find your way back to your spaceship?
Good. Right, that should do it. Now I want you to take off immediately. Get the truth back to your respective governments.
Tell them that they must mount a joint expedition and capture this base at once.
No, we'll need you to convince the Emperor, your Royal Highness.
Jo, I presume that the Tardis is still here?
Well, don't worry about us. Our spaceship is here.
Yes, well, would you mind blocking your ears and covering your eyes just for a moment?
No, but I think you will in a moment. Just do as I ask, would you? You too, Jo.
Can you?
Good. Er, how much longer are you going to keep us locked in here?
Yes, I'm talking to you.
Open the gate. Open the gate. Open the gate or I will exterminate you.
It worked.
Right.
Well, that's fascinating.
Yes, I'm not surprised. We've seen the real thing, haven't we. They're probably more frightened of him than they are of the Daleks.
General Williams.
Your Royal Highness.
You know, you really are incredibly persistent, aren't you?
Oh yes, yes, a most ingenious device. I congratulate you.
Help me up.
Help me into the Tardis, Jo.
All right, Jo.
The first thing we've got to do is get out of here.
Telepathic circuits. Sending a message to the Time Lords.

Human history.
I tell you, Brigadier, there's nothing to worry about. The brontosaurus is large and placid.
And stupid. If the square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the square on the other two sides, why is a mouse when it spins? Never did know the answer to that one.
Ah!
Key. Key, key, key, key. Key, key.
Yes, of course. Obvious place.
Am I? Don't you mean the infirmary?
Not fit? I'm the Doctor.
You may be a doctor, but I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say.
Not fit? Not fit? Of course I'm fit. All systems go!
Hearts beat?
Both a bit fast, are they?
Still, must be patient. A new body's like a new house. It takes a little bit of time to settle in.
Oh. As for the physiognomy. Well, nothing's perfect. Have to take the rough with the smooth. Mind you, I think the nose is a definite improvement. As for the ears, well, I'm not too sure. Tell me quite frankly, what do you say to the ears?
Well, of course you don't. Why should you? You're a busy man. You don't want to stand here burbling about my ears. Neither here nor there. I can't waste any more time. Things to do, places to go. I'm a busy man too, you know. Thank you for a most interesting conversation. Must be on my way.
How can I prove my point?
Mother, mother, I feel sick. Send for the doctor quick, quick, quick. Mother, dear, shall I die? Yes, my darling, by and by. One two three four.
Hello. Come to see me off, have you? Well, I hate goodbyes. I'll just slip away quietly.
Can't? Can't? There's no such word as can't.
Why not?
What for?
Can't I? Goodbye.
Excuse me.
Haven't me met somewhere before? No, don't tell me. Alexander the Great? No. Hannibal? No. Ah. Brigadier. Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart. How are you?
And Sarah Jane. Well now, isn't this nice? What was that you said about a secret weapon?
Ah, Brigadier.
Is something wrong?
Oh, no, not again.
Don't you like them?
Do you think I might attract attention?
One moment.
No? No.
Well, how about this?
I'll try again if you like.
Time we were off.
To visit the scene of the crime.
Tell me on the way, Brigadier. Tell me on the way. You must cultivate a sense of urgency.
Oh, but I am, I assure you. Look.
Not just squashed, flattened. Almost pulverised.
Now, how did it get like that?
Exactly. And according to my estimation of the resistance to pressure of vegetable fibre, it was stepped on by something that weighed a quarter of a ton.
Hmm. Just what you'd need for the control circuitry of one powerful, compact technological device. A disintegrator gun, for instance?
Something that brushes chains and electric fences like cobwebs. Something intelligent, that takes only what it needs and leaves the rest. Something that kills a man as casually as it crushes a dandelion.
I doubt it, Brigadier. More than human, perhaps.
By locking the next stable door in good time.
It, whatever it may be, has stolen the plans for the new disintegrator gun. It has also in its possession the necessary control circuitry.
Why else steal the plans and the circuitry? Now, assuming I'm right, and I invariably am, what is the third vital ingredient?
Exactly, Brigadier. Exactly.
Never cared much for the word impregnable. Sounds a bit too much like unsinkable.
Nothing, as the iceberg said to the Titanic.
Glug, glug, glug.
That still leaves one direction.
There seems to be a very large rat about, Brigadier.
Perhaps you should employ the services of a very large cat.
Whoever went through it didn't need to breathe.
Why should some alien life form invade Earth just to steal a new weapon? If they were that advanced, they'd have weapons of their own. Ha. Rather a splendid paradox, eh, Brigadier?
The only ones who could do it wouldn't need to.
Well, they might steal the plans, but why steal the circuits and the generators? An enemy government would have those resources itself.
I think your enemies are home grown, Brigadier. People with access to technological information and a most unusual weapon. A weapon that walks and thinks. In a word, anthropomorphic.
Only that they're prepared to kill to protect themselves. Where's Sarah?
Oh, it's surely not that difficult, Brigadier? Oh, thank you. There can't be many groups of people with the money and resources to design and build something like
Yes, something like that. However did you guess?
Scientific or medical.
I'd like to talk to Professor Kettlewell.
Plans for a new solar battery.
This will never do, you know.
If theta over x coincides with your disputed factor, you're losing half your output.
Look, the error's in the third part of the calculation.
But you're doing vital work, Professor. Earth's human race should have started tapping solar power long ago.
Well, there you are.
People never can see what's under their noses and above their heads.
And Copernicus.
Professor, I think you ought to tell us about the robot.
But the circuitry you built could be altered or tampered with.
Disintegrated?
I think the Brigadier has an idea, eh, Alastair?
Who was this man?
Anything interesting?
Oh, really? And who might they be?
Yes? Go on, then.
Let's pay a visit to Think Tank tomorrow, Brigadier. We can ask them to demonstrate Professor Kettlewell's robot. Good night.
Can't thank you enough for the visit. Been most amusing.
Yes, it does rather, but never mind. You've got to start somewhere. But there is one thing I'm looking forward to. Professor Kettlewell's robot. It's in here, isn't it?
Come on, then. Where's your tin man?
Oh dear. I do so hate being disappointed. I was determined to see that robot.
What? And such a harmless creature, too.
What, concern, compassion and useless things like that?
Now that is a pity. You see, one of our problems, Miss Winters, is. Oh, I say. You haven't still got the bits, have you? Maybe I could put it together again. I'm really rather good at that sort of thing.
In that case, I'm sure we needn't bother. Come along, Brigadier. Miss Winters has a great deal to do.
Please, don't let us detain you.
You know, I have a feeling we shall meet again.
Come along, Brigadier.
No, of course not, and they know I didn't. And I know that they know that I didn't, and they know that I know that
Either it's wandered off somewhere by itself or they've hidden it.
I beg your pardon, Brigadier. I was just thinking.
Yes? Yes, of course I'll talk to him. I'll talk to anybody. Professor Kettlewell? Yes, this is the Doctor.
Professor Kettlewell? Professor Kettlewell? Professor?
How do you do? I've been so looking forward to meeting you.
Yes, yes, of course.
How very kind of you.
Prime directive. What is your prime directive?
Then you mustn't harm me. I'm a friend of humanity.
Extraordinary. Extraordinary.
Then you must act without it. I know what they're up to now. Worked it all out while I was having my little nap. It's all tied up with the information stolen from that poor fellow Chambers. He must have been the guardian of some kind of ultimate threat.
I don't know exactly what it is, just the kind of thing it has to be. Well, am I right?
Well, naturally, I mean, the rest were all foreigners.
Yes, and start a nuclear holocaust that would turn this little planet of yours into a radioactive cinder suspended in space.
I'm afraid so.
Kettlewell? You let Sarah go off somewhere with Kettlewell?
Where is that pass?
Freedom to the city of Skaro? No. Pilot's licence for the Mars Venus rocket run. Galactic passport. Do you travel much? Honorary member of the Alpha Centauri Table Tennis Club.
Very tricky opponents, those chaps. Six arms, and of course six bats. It really keeps you on your toes. I'll tell you what, I'll just pop outside and try something
Oh dear, I'm terribly sorry. You just like there and get some rest. I'll find help. And above all, don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
Good evening, everyone. Now please, stay calm. Everyone keep your seat. Now then, what can I do to entertain you till my friend the Brigadier arrives? A little song? A little dance, perhaps? Not just a little dance? Anyone for cards?
Now for my next trick I shall require the assistance of a member of the audience.
I say, haven't we met somewhere before? Please, let me help you up.
Ow. Pity. Any other sporting member of the audience? Tell me one thing, Professor Kettlewell. Why?
Aren't you forgetting that in science, as in morality, the end never justifies the means.
You see what I mean, Professor?
It had to be Kettlewell. Only he could have attempted to reprogramme the robot to overcome its prime directive.
Faked. Faked to gain your confidence. And they still have the destructor codes, and Sarah. And now they'll hide up somewhere and try their blackmail plan, I suppose.
I rather imagine that has occurred to them. You'd better find them, Brigadier, and soon.
Or broken head, if someone overheard him calling us.
So if their bluff is called, they'll stay down there safe and sound and emerge to rule the survivors, if any.
Down, Brigadier! Everyone get down!
I don't think so, Brigadier. Automated machine gun nest, I fancy, activated by body heat when you get within range.)
Shush.
Good man.
Just a moment, Brigadier.
Come along then.
Oh, no. Must you? I really think we've had enough bangs and flashes for a bit, don't you? Hold on. Turns into a miniature sonic lance, you see.
Cut out the lock for you. It shouldn't take long.
Back. Everybody back.
I very much doubt it. Get your men back, Brigadier, if you don't want them killed.
I very much doubt it, Brigadier.
Power? Almost unlimited. Range, well, it could drill a hole in the surface of the moon.
Yes. Well, it's no use staying here. Brigadier, prepare your men for an attack. Try and draw the robot away from the door. I'll slip round behind it and finish cutting the lock.
I know, but we have to try.
Wait. The doors.
Sarah.
Now's our chance.
She may be right, Brigadier.
The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed, even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them obeying the original order, but
Not impossible.
And Sarah?
Gone home? You mean not one of you connected the disappearance of Sarah with the vanishing of the robot?
I think so. Don't you?
The robot killed Kettlewell, remember, the man who created it. It must be in a state of tremendous emotional shock. What more natural than it should turn to the one person who ever showed it kindness?
There is just one teeny weeny little thing.
Something else you haven't thought of. What are we going to do with it when we find it?
Did he now.
The same way that disease attacks animal tissue.
Yes?
Wonderful, Mister Benton. Wonderful! Brigadier, I must get to Kettlewell's place at once. You find the robot.
Why didn't that silly man write up his experiments properly?
Tell him to stop pestering me. I've found a metal virus and I'm trying to prepare an active solution, but he must give me time.
What? Yes. Yes, of course. Suppressed Oedipus complex leading to excessive guilt and overcompensation.
Brigadier, the robot will try to carry out Kettlewell's plan. Is the computer terminal in the bunker still active?
Can you switch off the electricity supply?
Then warn all the major powers. The emergency is not over. They must operate full fail-safe procedures at once.
Come along, man, come along.
We've done it, Harry. We've done it!
Said Alice.
I see our little problem seems to have grown. Where's Sarah?
Really, Brigadier, you should be more careful with your little toys. You've given it just the infusion of energy it needed.
I hope that won't be necessary.
Another piece of brilliance from the late Professor Kettlewell, and one that will solve our problem, I hope. Drive on, Harry.
Wish me luck, Brigadier.
Some of Kettlewell's metal virus in an active solution.
Oh, even faster, I hope. Look.
It's thrown the growth mechanism into reverse.
Thank you, Harry.
No. No, Brigadier, that won't be necessary. Look.
Sarah? Sarah?
Would you like a jelly baby? I had to do it, you know.
It was a wonderful creature, capable of great good, and great evil. Yes, I think you could say it was human. You know, what you need is a change. How about a little trip in a Tardis. I'm just off.
Why not? It's a free cosmos.
The Brigadier wants me to address the Cabinet, have lunch at Downing Street, dinner at the Palace, and write seventeen reports in triplicate. Well, I won't do it. I won't, I won't, I won't.
Why should I?
Well of course I am. There's no point in being grown up if you can't be childish sometimes. Are you coming?
We're just going on a little trip. Would you like a jelly baby?
Yes, as a matter of fact, in that old police box.
Do we?
Is it? You wouldn't like to step inside a moment? Just to demonstrate that it is all an illusion.
Oh, yes, it'll make me feel a lot better.
In you go.

The Satanic Nebula.
Or the lagoon of lost stars. Or we could go to Brighton. I've got a whole day worked out.
Have you?
Yeah, okay.
Yep, looking.
Why is your face all coloured in?
Are you taller?
What, do you have to reach a high shelf?
For a shelf?
Hardly anyone in the universe has that number.
Yes, from some woman in a shop. We still don't know who that was.
There are very few people that it could be.
Why not?
What?
Huh. It's just a phone, Clara. Nothing happens when you answer the phone.
Don't touch it.
It's a memory worm.
Deletes your memories.
The same way we all did, but we've all forgotten.
I am the Doctor, a Time Lord from Gallifrey. I have agreed to this memory wipe of my own free will.
Yes, you do. And change your shoes. You're next, Psi.
What are you doing?
Ah. Augmented. Nice.
Okay, okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop. Far enough. Augmented human. Computer augmented, yes? Mainframe in your head?
You're a liar. That's a prison code on your neck.
Good. This is a good day to be a bank robber. Mutant human. What kind of mutant?
It's my special power. What's yours?
Human cells. DNA from a customer, maybe? A disguise to get us in?
I don't think we have a choice. We've already agreed to.
How long can you maintain the image for?
Question one. Robbing banks is easy if you've got a Tardis. So why am I not using it?
Okay, that probably should be question one.
I don't know. Hate not knowing.
Interesting.
The latest thing in sniffer dogs. Telepathic. It hunts guilt.
Currently being drowned out.
If he has a plan, he's trying not to think of it.
It's wiping his mind. Turning his brain into soup.
He's gone already. It's over.
Those aren't tears, Clara. That's soup.
Depends what the thing is.
Okay, well, I'm no expert, but fuses, timer. I'm going to stick my neck out and saybomb. (to Psi) Bank schematic. Now.
The floor below is all service corridors, the veins and arteries of the bank.
He wants us to blow through the floor.
Well, not necessarily. There must be a plan.
Oh, don't be so pessimistic. It'll affect team morale.
Well, only very, very briefly.
What do you want, Psi, more than anything else? Whatever it is, it's in this bank. You agreed to rob the most impregnable bank in history. You must have had a very good reason. We all must have. Picture the thing you want most in the universe, and decide how badly you want it. Well?
Basically, it's the eyebrows.
Nice. Dimensional shift bomb. Sends the particles to a different plane. Come on then, Team Not Dead.
I don't know. The Architect set all this up. It should make sense. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon.
Yep.
A thing. Probably.
There you go. Thing time.
By breaking into the bank in advance of breaking into the bank.
Not our problem.
Guilt is our problem. Guilt, in this bank, is fatal. The Teller can hear it. Ever since that first case was opened, we've been targets. The more we know about why we're here, the louder our guilt screams. That's why we wiped our memories. For our own safety. Now, once I open this, I can't close it again.
I'm waiting for you to volunteer.
Because you didn't need that memory worm, did you? You're half-computer. You can perform a manual delete. You
Not a clue.
What is?
Interface with this.
Well, why not? There's no immediate threat.
I should stop saying things like that.
Clara, you stay with Psi. Saibra, let's go and investigate.
Aren't you going to ask me?
Exit strategy of sorts. How did you know I was lying?
Quite a gift.
It got us in here.
Why?
I don't know. But someone is watching.
Now this says place to hide.
Nobody move. Nobody say a word. It's cocooned. Forced hibernation. Its power is probably dormant.
Clara. It's locked on to you. It may still be asleep. Don't wake it.
Keep your mind blank. Block everything. Once it locks onto your thoughts, it won't let go.
It's waking up. Keep blocking your thoughts, Clara. Don't think.
It's scanning her brain.
Soup.
Saibra.
It's rooting through your brain. It's tasting all the secrets stashed inside. Any moment now, it will finish its sweep and start feasting on what's left.
Yes.
I'm sorry. I don't know how, once it's locked onto your thoughts.
Atomic shredder.
And instant.
I hate him, but I can't make that promise.
Right, vault. That's clear. What's not clear is what we do now.
No, I'm an amnesiac robbing a bank. Why would I be okay?
What? Saibra is dead, we are alive. Prioritise if you want to stay that way.
Listen. When we're done here, by all means, you go and find yourself a shoulder to cry on. You'll probably need that. Till then, what you need is me.
Another gift from the Architect. Shall we unwrap it?
Psi, how long?
It's locked on to one of our thought trails. We have to split up, minimise the brain signals.
Separate.
Keep your mind clear, Clara. Keep your mind blank.
Clara!
Multiple locks. Last one still in place.
Atomic seal. Unbreakable, even for me. The Architect would know that. He wouldn't bring us all this way for nothing.
Exactly. There must be some logic.
Come on, Architect. What else have you got?
A storm.The storm's tripping the system. That's what he's got, a storm.
(laughs) Of course. Stupid, stupid Doctor. Of course, of course.
Whoever planned all this, they're in the future. This isn't just a bank heist, it's a time travel heist. We've been sent back in time to the exact moment of the storm, to be in exactly the right place when it hits, because that's the only time the bank is vulnerable.
The bank is now open.
Come on.
It explains why we're not here in the Tardis.
The solar disruption would have made navigation impossible. The one time the bank is vulnerable is the one time we can't just land.
Technology. 251. Find it.
It's a neophyte circuit. (It lights up blue.) I've only ever seen one once before. It can reboot any system, replace any lost data.
So what did Saibra come for?
Gene suppressant.
Everyone has a weakness. So the big question is this. What did we come for?
Private vault. Karabraxos's own fortune?
Useful species.
Must be noisy inside its head. Painful to listen to so much chatter, so many secrets. Must drive it wild. How can you force it to obey?
You're scared.
If you don't like your boss, why stay?
Don't do this. I'm having a very bad day, and I do not want to be pushed around.
Wrong?
Why are you undoing my handcuffs?
Saibra?
No, no.Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Sorry, sorry, what? You, you, you're, you're alive?
No, no, no, no. Not dead. Alive.
Well, this is good, I suppose. You'll be able to resume the mission. Gene suppressant. Antidote for your condition.
Memory giver. All your yesterdays.
There you go. Job done, paid in full. Clever old Architect.
I still hate him.
I don't know. There's something in the private vault.
What's that?
Someone likes to hang out with their wealth.
Director Karabraxos? Excuse us, but we've come to rob you. So if you want to put your hands above your head, or
You're Karabraxos?
She's a clone.
She hates her own clones. She burns her own clones. Frankly, you're a career break for the right therapist.Shut up. Everybody, just, just shut up.
Shut up. Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shutetty up up up. What, what did you say? What did you say? What did you say about your own eyes? De-shut up. Say it again. SAIBRA: How can you trust someone if they look back at you out of your own eyes?
I know one thing about the Architect. What is it that I know about the Architect? I know one thing. Something that I've known from the very start.
I hate him. He's overbearing, he's manipulative, he likes to think that he's very clever. I hate him! Clara, don't you see?
I hate the Architect.
We're getting sanity judgment from the self-burner. Do you mind if I borrow a little bit of paper?
I'm giving you my telephone number.
Well, I thought you might like to call me someday.
Sorry, I thought we were getting along famously. Am I, like, misreading the signals or something?
Oh, that was a big one, wasn't it? I think that your bank is about to close for good, Karabraxos. If I was you, I'd get going. Don't mind us, we'll just stay here and burn.
Hard to know what to take. The greatest treasures of the universe in just one suitcase.
They're not shredders, they're teleports, and that's not the most interesting thing about them.
There were six of them. Hey. Give me a call me some time.
Yeah, you'll be old. We'll get on famously. You'll be old and full of regret for the things that you can't change.
No, not a thing. But I'm understanding.
I'm not sure yet. I need my memory back. And I think there's only one way to do that.
Soup.
Hello, big man. Peckish?
No, no. Let it take me. Let it read me. It's the only way.
What have I told you about pessimism? That's it, that's it. There are so many memories in here. Feast on them. Tuck in. Big scarf, bow tie, bit embarrassing. What do you think of the new look? I was hoping for minimalism, but I think I came up with magician. In the last few days, there's been a block. Can you see the block? Tell me why I'm here. Show me why I'm here. Show me!
It's just a phone, Clara. Nothing happens when you answer the phone.
Hello?
It's a little detour. It's a, it's a job,I've got to do it for someone. Come on.
We need to rob a bank.
Clara, I need worms.
The Bank of Karabraxos has never been breached.
Architect.
Architect.
Architect.
Architect.
You will rob the Bank of Karabraxos.
Did you see why we came? Why we're here? We had to delete our own memories, otherwise you'd have known, and then she'd have known, because you were mentally linked. But she's gone now. They've all gone. They have no power over you now. You can do exactly what you want to do now. Exactly what you've always wanted to do.
Of course it does. It was linked to Karabraxos.
Well so might you do, to protect everything you loved.
There she is. Not the last of its species. The last two.
It's okay, it's okay. It's all right.
Exactly. This wasn't a bank heist. It never was. It was rescue mission for a whole species. Flesh and blood, the last currency.
Time to go home. What do you think of that, big man?
So much mental traffic in the universe. Solitude is the only peace.
Gioffre Borgia, mucho scary hombre, says to me, what do you think of our Leaning Tower of Pisa? I say, (leans sideways) it looks okay to me.
Yeah. I kind of miss that.
7.12, local time, as promised. Go and enjoy yourself. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Don't worry. Calories consumed on the Tardis have no lasting effect.
Of course I'm kidding. It's a time machine, not a miracle worker. Bye, bye.
Don't rob any banks what?
Course not, boss.
Robbing a bank. Robbing a whole bank. Beat that for a date.

Run.
How long are you going to stay with me?
Just, just, just put me down!
Bazoolium.
Tell me something new.
They're everywhere!
What do you mean, shift? Since when did ghosts have shifts? Since when did shifts have ghosts? What's going on?
But no one's running or screaming or freaking out.
What the hell's going on?
It's all over the world.
When did it start?
No, I mean worldwide.
The more you want it, the stronger it gets.
Like a psychic link. Of course you want your old dad to be alive, but you're wishing him into existence. The ghosts are using that to pull themselves in.
I'm sorry, Jackie, but there's no smell, there's no cigarettes. Just a memory.
Maybe not. They're pressing themselves into the surface of the world. But a footprint doesn't look like a boot.
Who you going to call?
I ain't afraid of no ghosts.
When's the next shift?
Triangulates their point of origin.
Nah. They were just coming through one little rift. This lot are transposing themselves over the whole planet. Like tracing paper.
I think it's horrific. Rose, give us a hand.
As soon as the cones activate, if that line goes into the red, press that button there. If it doesn't stop
Setting fifteen B. Hold it against the port, eight seconds and stop.
If it goes into the blue, activate the deep scan on the left.
Close.
Now you've just killed us.
Yeah! Now, what've we got. Two minutes to go?
What's the line doing?
Here we go!
Come on then, you beauty!
Don't like that much, do you? Who are you? Where are you coming from? Whoa!
That's more like it! Not so friendly now, are you?
I said so! Those ghosts have been forced into existence from one specific point, and I can track down the source. Allons y!
I like that. Allons y. I should say allons y more often. Allons y. Watch out, Rose Tyler. Allons y. And then, it would be really brilliant if I met someone called Alonso, because then I could say, allons y, Alonso, every time. You're staring at me.
Oh well there goes the advantage of surprise. Still, cuts to the chase. Stay in here, look after Jackie.
Well, you brought her.
And I haven't. Which makes me the better person, don't you think? They can shoot me dead, but the moral high ground is mine.
Er, thanks. Nice to meet you. I'm the Doctor.
You, you've heard of me, then?
And you are?
Yes. Sorry. Good point. She's just a bit shy, that's all.
But here she is, Rose Tyler.
Hmm. She's not the best I've ever had. Bit too blonde. Not too steady on her pins. A lot of that.
And just last week, she stared into the heart of the Time Vortex and aged fifty seven years. But she'll do.
Deluded. Bless. I'll have to trade her in. Do you need anyone? She's very good at tea. Well, I say very good, I mean not bad. Well, I say not bad. Anyway, lead on. Allons y. But not too fast. Her ankle's going.
That's a Jathar Sunglider.
What, did it crash?
That's a particle gun.
It's the twenty first century. You can't have particle guns.
Have you got anyone called Alonso?
No, I suppose not. What was your name?
So, what about these ghosts?
Of what?
You'll never get inside it.
All those times I've been on Earth, I've never heard of you.
1879. That was called Torchwood, that house in Scotland.
But if I'm the enemy, does that mean that I'm a prisoner?
Yeah.
This is a Void Ship.
Well, it's impossible for starters. I always thought it was just a theory, but it's a vessel designed to exist outside time and space, travelling through the Void.
The space between dimensions. There's all sorts of realities around us, different dimensions, billions of parallel universes all stacked up against each other. The Void is the space in between, containing absolutely nothing. Imagine that. Nothing. No light, no dark, no up, no down, no life, no time. Without end. My people called it the Void. The Eternals call it the Howling. But some people call it Hell.
To explore? To escape? You could sit inside that thing and eternity would pass you by. The Big Bang, end of the Universe, start of the next, wouldn't even touch the sides. You'd exist outside the whole of creation.
Oh, yes.
We don't! We send that thing back into Hell. How did it get here in the first place?
Show me.
How did you even find it?
You built a skyscraper just to reach a spatial disturbance? How much money have you got?
So, you find the breach, probe it, the sphere comes through six hundred feet above London, bam. It leaves a hole in the fabric of reality. And that hole, you think, oh, shall we leave it alone? Shall we back off? Shall we play it safe? Nah, you think let's make it bigger!
Cancel it.
I'm warning you, cancel it.
Let me show you. Sphere comes through.
But when it made the hole, it cracked the world around it. The entire surface of this dimension splintered. And that's how the ghosts get through. That's how they get everywhere. They're bleeding through the fault lines. Walking from their world, across the Void, and into yours, with the human race hoping and wishing and helping them along. But too many ghosts, and
Miss Hartman, I am asking you, please don't do it.
Then stop at a thousand!
Okay.
Never mind. As you were.
No, fair enough. Said my bit. Don't mind me. Any chance of a cup of tea?
Mmm, can't wait to see it.
No, absolutely not. Pull up a chair, Rose. Come and watch the fireworks.
Thank you.
I'm glad to be of help.
Must have. Aimed it at this dimension like a cannon ball.
Never seen her before in my life.
Oh, all right then. It was worth a try. That's, that's Rose Tyler.
Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother.
I've got a reputation to uphold.
What's she doing?
She can't hear you. They're overriding the system. We're going into Ghost Shift.
It's the ear piece. It's controlling them. I've seen this before. Sorry. I'm so sorry.
They're dead.
Oh, someone else did that long before I got here.
Jackie, I haven't got time for this.
Don't.
Trust me, leave them alone.
What about the Ghost Shift?
They're still controlling it. They've hi-jacked the system.
It might be a remote transmitter but it's got to be close by. I can trace it. Jackie, stay here!
What's down here?
You should go back.
Ear pieces, ear pods. This world's colliding with another, and I think I know which one.
They came through first. The advance guard.
Cybermen!
Get away from the machines. Do what they say. Don't fight them!
Here come the ghosts.
Do you never listen? A footprint doesn't look like a boot.
They're Cybermen. All of the ghosts are Cybermen. Millions of them, right across the world.
It's not an invasion. It's too late for that. It's a victory.
But I don't understand. The Cybermen don't have the technology to build a Void Ship. That's way beyond you. How did you create that sphere?
What?
Then what's inside it?

So there's this man. He has a time machine. Up and down history he goes, zip zip zip zip zip, getting into scrapes.
Another thing he has is a passion for the works of Ludwig van Beethoven.
And one day he thinks, what's the point of having a time machine  if you don't get to meet your heroes? So off he goes to eighteenth century Germany. But he can't find Beethoven anywhere.  No one's heard of him, not even his family have any idea who the time traveller is talking about.
Beethoven literally doesn't exist. This didn't happen, by the way. I've met Beethoven. Nice chap. Very intense.  Loved an arm-wrestle. No, this is called the Bootstrap Paradox. Google it. The time traveller panics.
He can't bear the thought of a world  without the music of Beethoven. Luckily he'd brought all of his Beethoven sheet music for Ludwig to sign.  So he copies out all the concertos, and the symphonies and
Where's Bennett? We need to get going.
Oh, time travel does that sometimes.
You seem to know an awful lot about me.
In anger?
1980.
The Minister of War?
No, never mind. I expect I'll find out soon enough.
Ah ha. Don't worry. Shall we go?
Er, we haven't. We're still in Scotland. This is the town before it flooded. The Tardis has brought us to when the spaceship first touched down. But here and now, it's the height of the Cold War. The military were being trained for offensives on Soviet soil.
No, that's the body.
This isn't just any spaceship. It's a hearse.
Yet.
Yes, I've had dealings with your lot before. I can't say I'm a fan.
What are you doing here?
He means the planet.
Listen, we've come from the future. You're about to send some sort of signal. How do you do it? Is it a special pen?
The technology you use. The thing that wrenches the soul out of the body and makes it repeat your coordinates for eternity. Give it to me now, I'm going to take the batteries out.
So who sends the message?
Back to the Tardis. I need to talk to Clara.
Yeah, fine. So listen, the spaceship, it's a hearse.
Clara, what's wrong?
What? Who? Has someone died?
Yeah. Well, currently.
It means I die.
This isn't a potential future. This is the future now. It's already happened. The proof is right there in front of you. I have to die.
I can't. Even the tiniest change, the ramifications could be catastrophic. It could spread carnage and chaos across the universe like ripples on a pond. Oh, well, I've had a good innings. (to O'Donnell) This regeneration, it's a bit of a clerical error anyway. (to Clara) I've got to go sometime.
Clara, I need to talk to you just on your own.
Listen to me. We all have to face death eventually, be it ours or someone else's.
I can't change what's already happened. There are rules.
Clara.
I can't save Moran or Pritchard.
I'll do what I can, but the future has already happened. We've just met the Undertaker and he's still alive.
So. Ghost me. You've got a better view than me. How do I look? Any signs of trauma, any scars? Any clues as to how I die?
I assume I'm just saying the same thing as the others.
The mole-faced chap.
What's the matter, Clara, what's happening?
What am I doing?
I'm not trying to kill you? Why am I not trying to kill you?
I need to talk to me now.
In a minute. I need to talk to the ghost me.
Doctor. Such an honour. I've always been a huge admirer. This is really a delight. Finally someone worth talking to. So firstly, why are you here?
Clara? Clara, what's happening?
What?
Clara, now the ghosts are out, go to the Faraday cage. They won't be able to get you in there. Oh, there's a problem.
The phone signal won't be able to get through. What you'll have to do, Clara, put the phone outside, and you can watch it through the little round porthole. And when you see it ringing, if it's safe to do so, go out and answer it.
Clara, listen to me. Don't let that phone out of your sight. I need to be able to reach you, I need to know everything my ghost does. Do you understand? I'll come back for you. I swear.
Come on. Oh, wait a minute. Not you, O'Donnell.
Someone needs to stay here and mind the shop. What if Clara calls?
Prentis. Prentis!
The Fisher King did it himself. The future is still coming.
He's taken the suspended animation chamber to the church.
We need to get back to the Tardis. Now!
It's cut us off.
No, Bennett! Wait!
I thought perhaps, because her ghost wasn't there in the future, like Prentis's was, I thought maybe, maybe it wouldn't happen. Maybe she stood a chance.
Clara.
This isn't about saving me. I'm a dead man walking. I'm changing history to save Clara.
Big day for you. Time travel, twice!
Off the map. Out of the rule book. What if I don't die? What if I refuse? I'm going to go back to the base and I'm going to save Clara, because that's what I do. And I don't see anyone here who's going to stop me.
Why are we still here?
No. No, no, no, no, no.
We've moved half an hour backwards. I'm locked in my own time stream. The Tardis won't let me leave.
Now we have to keep out of sight, until time catches up.
Where's Bennett? We need to get going.
No, he's just not dead yet. And we don't tell him.
No!
However that sentence ends, no, we can't. Save him, and you'll want to save O'Donnell. You can't cheat time. I just tried. You can't just go back and cut off tragedy at the root. Because you find yourself talking to someone you just saw dead on a slab. Because then you really do see ghosts. We don't tell him. Understand? Not a word. We don't have that right.
Yes, I've had dealings with your lot before. I can't say I'm a fan.
What are you doing here?
Oh. I need more time. It's too soon. I haven't saved her yet. Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock. I've got no choice now, I have to face the Fisher King. You, back to the Tardis.
Now I'm ready.
I've come from the future. I've seen the chaos you cause. The bloodshed.
Ghosts.
Souls wrenched from the dead. Repeating directions to here, to this spot, over and over.
Four that I know of. Maybe five by now. Probably more since I left.
What will happen when your people arrive?
This world is protected, by me.
You know, you've got a lot in common with the Tivoleans. You'll both do anything to survive. They'll surrender to anyone. You will hijack other people's souls and turn them into electromagnetic projections. That will to endure. That refusal to ever cease. It's extraordinary. And it makes a fella think. Because you know what? If all I have to do to survive is tweak the future a bit, what's stopping me? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The ripple effect. Maybe it will mean that the universe will be ruled by cats or something, in the future. But the way I see it, even a ghastly future is better than no future at all. You robbed those people of their deaths, made them nothing more than a message in a bottle. You violated something more important than Time. You bent the rules of life and death. So I am putting things straight. Here, now, this is where your story ends.
I've already done it. The words have gone. I got rid of them. The future I saw, none of that will happen now. The message will never contaminate my friends. No one will die. No one is coming to save you. That's the thing about knowing you're going to die. You've got nothing left to lose.
This is security protocol seven one two. The echelon circuit has been activated. Please stow any hand luggage and prepare for departure.
Don't kiss me. Morning breath.
Follow me.
It's the call of the Fisher King. The call of their master.
A hologram. Like the one we made of you to lure the ghosts into the Faraday cage. With a soupon of artificial intelligence, and a few pre-recorded phrases thrown in.
Ah!
All beamed from the sonic glasses.
As soon as you brought me and the chamber on board, it connected with the base's wi-fi and Bob's your uncle, you've got a ghost Doctor.
Because they're electromagnetic projections that were out of phase with the base's day mode.
That's it. I've erased the memory of the writing. Though you might find you've lost a couple of other memories too. You know, like people you went to school with, or previous addresses or how to drink liquids. That's you two done. Where's Bennett?
UNIT will cut out the Faraday cage with them inside and take it away. Then the space-hearse will be destroyed, so the writing doesn't infect anyone else.
I don't understand.
I need to erase that message from your mind, but it's fine, I'll do it later.
Drag the cage into space, away from the Earth's magnetic field. With nothing to sustain them, the ghosts will eventually fade away.
The Fisher King had been dead for a hundred and fifty years before we even got here. But once I went back, I became part of events. But here's the thing. The messages my ghost gave, they weren't for you, they were for me. That list. Everyone after you was random, but you being the next name,
That was me telling me to get inside and when to set it for.
Except that's not why I said them.
I programmed my ghost to say them because that's what my ghost had said. And the only reason I created my ghost hologram in the first place was because I saw it here. I was reverse engineering the narrative.
You do not understand. When did I first have those ideas, Clara?
Exactly. Who composed Beethoven's Fifth?

Even simple one-dimensional chess exposes the limitations of the machine mind.
What?
Rubbish!
Leela, keep still.
And shut up. I'm trying to concentrate.
I know it's my move. Don't flash your eyes at me.
What?
Really? Are you sure?
What? All right, if you must. What is it?
So?
What?!
We might have gone right through the time spiral! Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't.
You didn't.
You didn't.
It's that confounded paint. It's always jamming things up. Stay calm. I'm going to materialise and take a reading.
We're still in the Solar System. Pluto?
Yes, Pluto.
Leela, tell your tin friend to shut up.
Breathable atmosphere. That's wrong.
Pluto's a lifeless rock. Leela? I think you and I should take a W A L K.
W-a-l-k.
No, no, no. You're not coming. You stay here.
No.
No! Pluto's no place for a
Quite warm. Around twenty degrees. Very humid.
It's all wrong. It shouldn't be like Earth. Unless, of course, the Sun's turned nova.
Fascinating.
What an engineering achievement, eh?
Don't joggle, Leela. Don't joggle. You can look in a minute.
Must have taken them centuries to build a city like that.
What?
Don't touch him!
Magnificent view, isn't it. How high is this building?
A thousand metres? My. Are we interrupting something?
Somehow I have the impression you're thinking of killing yourself.
What?
Oh, the taxes. My dear old thing, all you need is a wiley accountant. Would you care for a jelly baby? Hmm? Try one.
They're rather good.
Now, tell us about it. This is Leela, I'm the Doctor.
He can't make ends meet. Probably too many economists in the government.
Well, roughly speaking, but paying tax is more painful.
Well, if little Cordo's at all typical, they haven't any spirit left for fighting.
What?
Suns?
Pity K9 can't bark.
What is it?
For someone who wanted to commit suicide a few minutes ago, you seem very anxious not to be caught.
Come on, Leela.
I don't know. Why did you run?
That's no answer.
I don't know. Odd, isn't it?
He says you're right.
What's the hurry?
We'll come with you.
No, I'm interested in this Undercity. Always like to get to the bottom of things.
He means there's no night on this planet, Leela. That's why the concept of darkness frightens him.
Not if the sidereal and axial rotation periods are the same, or if there's more than one sun.
What, six suns on Pluto?
In-station fusion satellites. Galileo would have been impressed.
Cordo?
Which way?
Well, go on.
Too late.
Take your hand off that knife, Leela.
Hello. You must be the others.
You did not catch us. We allowed you to escort us.
Really? How many other planets have you been to?
I can see we're going to get on famously.
Do you think he's insulting me?
No.
Shush. We haven't come here to fight. We haven't come here to fight.
Because my new little chum here seemed unhappy about something.
Yes, the D grade.
I'll get him up. Come on, don't be frightened.
Hmm?
Well I'm delighted to. Oh, no, no, we're just tourists. We're not staying.
On the other hand, it is quite cozy. Don't you think it's quite cozy here?
Oh, good.
A thousand talmars. Stolen?
Stolen.
Hmm. What do these Ajacks look like, if I'm pretending to be one. I ask merely for information.
Er, computer microloaded, er, do you feed it into a reader?
Subway thirty seven.
What? Suppose I refuse to go?
It was just a passing thought.
It was a bit stuffy, but unscented.
Nothing, just an idea. K9.
Didn't I tell you to stay in the Tardis?
Tens, please.
Where?
How long have I been here?
An hour.
Thank you.
Going for a little hop. Good for the circulation. What did they get you for?
That's a crime here?
Go on.
Ah.
So you carried on taking them?
What does PCM stand for?
What?
Enough to recognise an anxiety inducing agent when I smell one.
That's what they tell you. It also eliminates freedom.
Tell me, Bisham, how do they spread the PCM through the atmosphere?
I should think so too. Do you know how long we've been sitting here without any attention at all? Do you know that?
I said, do you know how long we've been sitting here without any attention? Are you deaf or something? Is he deaf or something?
Ah. Right. I'm glad he isn't deaf.
I would have felt guilty. Don't leave it in too long, it goes frizzy.
Oh, that's all right, Bisham. We'll have another opportunity to talk. There's a lot you can tell me.
I wouldn't touch that, if I were you.
I said, I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Are you sure he wasn't deaf?
Not long, I'm afraid. There's no need to hurry on our account. Take a break or something. Have a cup of tea. Have some jelly babies. There are some in my coat pocket. No? All right.
Hello.
Ah, thank you. I don't like this jacket. Not very comfortable. I like a jacket with a lot of pockets, don't you? What's the next treat going to be, hmm? What's your name?
Gatherer Hade?
What about my chum?
Thank you.
Yes, especially for an Ajack.
Indeed. But how very clever of you to know my name.
Ah.
Oh, not at all, not at all. Your guards were entirely charming, and so attentive.
To forgive is fine?
Oh, thank you, thank you. Thank you.
Rubus idaeus?
Have you ever tasted raspberry leaf tea? Awfully good for aliments of the throat.
Yes.
Remarkable.
I can hardly credit it.
Mind you, I've often wondered why we left Old Earth.
Not long, no.
Well, I shall certainly try. In fact, I shall start right now.
Humbug?
Suppertime? Save me some.
Well, I was, I was, but it was all a misunderstanding. Gatherer apologised profusely. Shush.
A thousand talmars.
No trick. Gave me a raspberry leaf as well. Where's Leela?
What?
Mandrell, you made a certain threat before I left. If anything's happened to that girl.
Once upon a time there were three sisters.
Good.
Maybe he liked my face.
Ah, that's a catch question. With a brain your size you don't think, right?
Or we can do it the hard way. I've heard that one, too.
Well, even Gatherers have their bad days.
About what?
I only made one deal, Mandrell, and that was with you under duress, and you haven't kept your part of it.
Yes, that sort of subtle approach is always more effective than crude violence.
You're a fool, Mandrell. I don't know why yet, but I was released from the Correction Centre. The Gatherer gave me a cock and bull story about machine error, and he gave me a thousand talmars to make it sound convincing. That's all I know.
You're not very good at it, Mandrell.
It's the eyes. No conviction.
Oh, put it aside, Mandrell. You look a fool.
Three.
Five.
Ha!
Thank you, gentlemen.
Nice to see you both. Where's Leela? Well, where is she?
No, no, I'm not. I'm not, Goudry. I'm asking you to help yourselves. Nothing will change round here unless you change it.
You can't do anything, but there are fifty million people in this city. Think how the guards will react to that number.
Given the chance to breathe clean air for a few hours, they might. Have you thought of that?
There's always a way. Come here.
Listen, that drug is volatilized into the atmosphere. What's its critical temperature?
Two hundred and five centigrade. So if we lower the temperature in the chamber
What?
How do you know that?
You mean take over Main Control?
Only your claims.
Oh, it was nothing. I have a gift for the apt phrase.
There's no if about it, Cordo. We will.
First of all we've got to blind the scanner system. At the moment it's sensitised on me, so I can't move from this spot.
Well, every few metres along the subway there are tubes in the walls.
No, I mean the oculoid electronic monitors. They're connected to concealed cables. Cordo, I want two of them brought here.
Cordo?
Take care. I mean, unplug them carefully.
Yes?
What is this Company? Can anyone tell me that?
Shush. I mean, who runs it? What's it for?
A profit?
But who gets the profit? Where does it go?
Wouldn't it be interesting to find the answer?
Cordo, take these. They're ready.
Now listen. Bisham and Mandrell, stay with me. Now the rest of you, I want you to scatter through the city and tell the people what's happening. Remind them that they're human beings, and tell them that human beings always have to fight for their freedom. All right?
You all know what to do?
Let's go.
Good.
One more time, just for luck.
Right, well that should do it.
Well, I fixed a static loop, what else. Mandrell, you lead the way. Cordo second, Bisham third. K9, fifth.
Peanuts. It's an insult. The Droges of Gabrielides offered a whole star system for my head once.
Yes, nasty horrid smelly things. Carry on, Cordo.
What?
What do they mean, a steaming?
Come here, Bisham. Listen, I. Mandrell! Mandrell, what would happen if we cut the water supply to the pumps?
No, no, no, just for a few minutes. Just long enough to get her out.
So we let that pressure out.
Why not?
What? What is it?
Yes, yes.
Yes, but could you open a valve?
Attempt to blast. We'll try it. Get that vent open.
K9, I don't know how to say this, K9.
Good dog.
Get the vent open.
Mandrell, reverse the pumps.
I know, I know. Well done, K9.
All right. Now, don't call me. You understand? I'll call you.
Who was making all that noise?
I told you not to use that radio link.
You told the Collector, too! That fish-blooded sadist had Leela's casket wired for sound.
Ah, ah, Cordo. We've got a great deal to do yet.
Is it?
Shush. Where's the public video system controlled from?
If the public video system announced there'd been a successful rebellion, think of the effect.
Right.
He's guarded by his Inner Retinue, and most of them are down there with him. Come on, Leela, let's go.
Everybody keep calm, keep calm. Keep quiet. You two back there. You three over there. Leela, behind the door.
All right, tie them up.
Pretty soon the whole place will be under siege here. K9? (to Bisham) I want you to hold out as long as possible.
Of course you will.
Good man. K9?
K9?
K9, where are you?
Ah, there you are. Now, listen. I want you to give my friends all the help they need. You understand?
You're a good dog. Come on, Leela. Gentlemen, good luck.
No, no, no.
No, don't kill him. He hasn't done you any harm.
No. Get up. Come on, get up.
Then we'll make sure this one doesn't get away. Here, look at me. Look at me! Now listen. It's your sleep time. Sleep time. You're feeling very sleepy. Very sleepy. It's your sleep time. You will go to sleep and stay asleep until I tell you to wake up. Until I tell you to wake up.
Come on. Come on.
Wake up.
What, that? Poof, it's just a knack. You've either got it or you haven't.
What is it?
What, like a spider in the middle of a web?
I understand all this. He has a computer feeding and analysing the daily returns from each Megropolis. Suppose. Suppose he wants to broadcast some pleasing bit of news, hmm? Like the imposition of a double vision tax on people with more than one eye. Well, then, he feeds it into there.
He did?
That should do it.
What, that? It's a safe. Company vault.
Shush.
What was that?
Neither did I.
I always whisper when I'm opening safes. What is it?
I don't know. It always looks so easy.
I don't know.
Why won't you listen to me? Why don't you girls listen to me?
Oh, I was just checking the books.
I'm not the Auditor, I'm the Doctor.
No, I won't kill you. Just close you down.
Oh, delighted, delighted.
Hmm. Company solidly based. You've a widely diversified operational field. Yes.
Yes, I cut the answering service not to interrupt our little conference.
Tell me about the Company.
Yes.
Yes, cut the sales talk. Where's the Head Office?
Ah. I might have guessed from your squiddy little eyes. Hmm.
Oh yes, oh yes. The Usurians are listed in Professor Thripsted's Flora and Fauna of the Universe under poisonous fungi.
Quite mad. Mad as a hatter.
Tell me, how did you get control of humanity?
Go on.
And then taxed the life out of them. I mean, to recover your capital costs.
Phew. What about the four intervening planets?
So then you really put the screws on. I mean, the running costs must be very high.
Six suns. Six! My, my. And so when this planet's exhausted you can move your slave labour force elsewhere?
Leaving the humans to die.
You blood-sucking leech! You won't stop until you own the entire galaxy, will you. Don't you think commercial imperialism is as bad as military conquest?
You
Ah. The revolution's getting nearer. What's the Company policy on that?
Oh, wake up. Wake up. Look at the facts.
You and a handful of bureaucrats won't put the people back in chains now.
Oh, it's you again. What did I say?
Rain stops play. I don't think that'll damp down this revolution.
Except you.
No, but this chap at my shoulder, he breathes air.
Don't be a fool.
Good throw! Good throw.
What's contingency plan B?
You'll like this bit. You'll like it.
Cordo, I don't think he's listening.
I do. He's gone back to his natural form. He was only held in that state by particle radiation. That's why he never left that machine.
Oh, yes.
Well, you could put the plug in if you want.
Well, if you'd seen a Usurian you'd know what I mean. They look like sea kale with eyes. I mean, would you take orders from a lump of seaweed? Huh? Hmm? Cordo?
Leela, let K9 in the Tardis. Goodbye, Cordo.
Well, I'll pop back and see you again when you've settled again on Earth.
Well, you're used to hard work. This time, you'll be free.
Well, I do, I do. The Earth will have regenerated itself since you left. Get back to your place under your own sun.
Course they will. Three hundred million of you can't go wrong. Goodbye everyone!
Which is more than I can say for the Tardis.
Nothing. I was just finishing a thought. Now, where were we?
Oh, be quiet, K9.
He got a bit of a shock. You see, I fed two percent growth tax into the computers. Index linked. Blew the economy and he couldn't take it.
Well, I. What do you think, K9?
K9 thinks it was clever.
I am so sorry, K9.
No, shut up while I apologise. I am so. Listen. As soon as I've reset the coordinates, we'll finish that game of chess.

Well, I told you I'd get you back home safely, didn't I?
Well, there's no point in going back there. No, I set course for UNIT HQ.
The space time coordinates were a bit out, that's all. We can't be far away.
Somewhere in London.
Well, when we left. Give or take a few weeks.
My dear Sarah, you are perfectly safe. Now all we've got to do now is go and find a telephone and ring the Brigadier.
Well, the parks department's cutting down some trees. Come on.
No, it doesn't work.
That's a very unfair word, you know, because actually the Vandals were quite decent chaps. Come on, let's see if we can go and find a taxi.
Yes.
There's no anything. No, nothing's moving. No bicycles, no pedestrians, no cars, nothing.
Well, perhaps it's Sunday. Great Britain always closes on Sundays. Come on, I think we'd better walk.
Well, perhaps he doesn't like hitch-hikers.
Anybody here?
Do as he says, Sarah. Sarah, do as he says! Look, I realise that you're very busy, but would you mind telling me what's going on around here?
Sarah, no! He's liable to shoot you out of pure terror.
Listen.
It's stopping. Come on.
Hello? Hello?
Not really, no. Help me up, will you?
Oh, it's an ill wind. At least we've got some transport. Open that door, Sarah, will you?
Get out! Come on, in the back!
Will you please tell me what's happening?
Look, will you please tell me what's going on here?
Now, if I can have a word with someone in authority.
Doctor John Smith. No relation.
You'd never believe me.
Come on, Sarah. Let's go and have our photos taken, shall we?
Oh, deary me, that's very antiquated equipment, isn't it? I'll think you'll find that the right is my best side.
Oh, all right.
Now, what about one of both of us? Come and join in.
No, we'd rather stand, if you don't mind.
Oh! What a good idea. There we are.
That's better.
Wait for the officer to turn up. Maybe we can get some sense out of him.
I've no idea. Maybe this gentleman here can enlighten us.
How do you do, sir? I'm the Doctor.
Yes?
(sotto) No. Do you?
(sotto) No, thank you very much.
We do have names, you know.
Now just one moment.
Sir, I am the scientific advisor to UNIT, and I demand to be put in immediate touch with Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart.
Yes, as a matter of fact he is.
(sotto) Tell me, my friend. What was that idea that you had about escaping?
(sotto) Oh, I think we can be a bit more original than that, can't we?
(sotto) We have a fight.
You're the nark, aren't ya? It was you wot grassed on us!
Yes, you did. Come on! On your feet! Come on, up!
(sotto) Steady.
Never mind that now. Come on, let's get out of here.
Oh, so much for honour amongst thieves. Hai!
Come on, quick, out of here! Come on!
A piece of wire to jump the ignition. I'll try in the back.
And how was I to know it was detention centre transport?
A Tyrannosaurus Rex. The largest and fiercest predator of all time.
Yes, sixty five million years ago, to be precise.
Sorry.
There we are. Right, now let's review the situation. A prehistoric monster's turned up in central London.
Because those soldiers were talking about the central zone, weren't they.
That's a very good question, Sarah.
What, producing a sweet little baby monster?
Perhaps somebody kept it as a pet and turned it out when it got too big to feed.
Anyway, aren't you forgetting that pterodactyl that attacked us in the warehouse?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I think I have.
Hello? Who are you?
Wizard? I'm no wizard, I assure you. You've got no need to be frightened of me.
How did you get here?
Yes, yes, of course. Look, do you know what year it is?
I only wish I could.
I'm afraid I don't have that power.
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. That was a time eddy. For a moment there, time went backwards.
Can you bolt that door?
Hide.
Hai! Brigadier.
How many of these things have been seen up to now?
Well, that's absolutely marvellous, Brigadier. Now what're you doing about the real problem?
Well, having contained them, what do you do then?
Well, that's pretty obvious, isn't it, Sarah?
Back where they came from, into the past.
Mike, my dear fellow, how are you? Good to see you again.
Certainly.
You can ask but I don't guarantee that you'll get a reply.
Oh, is he indeed. How do you do, General.
Somebody or something is operating a temporal displacement on a very vast scale.
The creatures are being brought from the past into the present, General, staying here for a while and then returning to their own time.
I take it then that you have a better theory.
Er, Miss Smith is presently acting as my assistant, General. You were saying, my dear?
You'll do no such thing, Brigadier.
General, we need to study this creature, not shoot at it. How much do you think we'll learn from a dead dinosaur? Come on, Brigadier. I want you to take me down there right away.
Good grief! It's a Stegosaurus. What a splendid specimen. No, no, don't shoot. I want to take a good look at it.
Don't worry, Brigadier, it's a vegetarian.
Right, we'll need some rope and a strong net.
Yes, of course. I want to observe it under laboratory conditions. Have you got any rope?
That's my intention, yes.
That creature has an amiable disposition, Brigadier, and a brain about the size of a walnut. I think we should be able to deal with it, don't you?
It's all right, Corporal, don't bother.
No, sir.
Yes, General Finch. That is precisely what happened.
The Brigadier and his men couldn't see what happened, sir. They were temporally affected by a time eddy.
Whenever a creature appears or disappears, the temporal displacement causes a localised distortion in time. Now as far as the people in the immediate vicinity were concerned, time literally runs backwards, so naturally, they'd have no recollection of what had occurred.
Well, we must capture one of the creatures.
Well, I think a study of one of these dinosaurs, General, might lead me to the source.
Then why are they contained to this one area? These giant reptiles existed all over the planet, Mike. They'd be popping up everywhere.
Well, I think he was an accident. Whoever's responsible for these apparitions, General, is operating from somewhere in this area.
Well, that's where you're wrong, Mike. Someone's there and whoever it is is using vast amounts of power.
Then someone, Brigadier, is making their own.
Naturally.
By a simple molecular reaction.
I doubt it. The principle hasn't really been developed on Earth yet.
Well, it'll temporarily neutralise creatures' brain cells.
All animals have brains of some sort, Mike.
It'll faint.
Surround it with an electrical field and wait for it to disappear.
Well, the source of the power that is moving these creatures through time.
Mmm, pretty accurate. Enough for the Brigadier and his merry men to round up the guilty parties anyway.
Yes, that would be helpful.
Oh, no. Look, ask Captain Yates, there's a good girl.
Hmm? Yes, yes, anything you like.
I didn't.
No.
Well, there is.
Go away.
Yeah, I'm sure he'd enjoy that.
Oh no!
Well, I'm glad somebody does.
Yes, I sincerely hope so. Aren't you the chap who started the 'Save Planet Earth' society?
You also wrote that book, Last Chance For Man, didn't you?
Oh, my dear Grover, I'm delighted to meet you. This planet needs people like you.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense, no need to rush away. Come over here. Let me explain to you what I'm doing. Now then, in the first place
I think it will. All we need now is a dinosaur to try it out on.
Yes. I believe these dinosaurs are being used purely as a terror weapon in order to clear central London.
Well, presumably, so that some vast project can be carried out. Something for which people will get in the way.
Why, indeed. Well, there must be some overriding reason. There must be something that they need that's only available to them here.
Any idea what kind it is?
Apatosaurus, commonly known as the brontosaurus. Large, placid and stupid. That's exactly what we need.
Will you excuse us, Minister? I'll let you know as soon as we've captured it. Come on, Brigadier.
Jolly good. Right, let's go and take a look at it.
The bigger, the better, Brigadier.
The larger the mass, the greater the temporal displacement for my instruments to measure.
Then I shall simply turn round and come back, feeling rather foolish.
Not unless it's roused, Captain Yates. Mind you, I wouldn't like to try it on a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
That won't be necessary.
Yes, I think so. Mind you, that creature isn't what I wanted at all. What I really wanted was a brontosaurus.
The difference, Brigadier, is that the brontosaurus is a placid vegetarian, whereas the Tyrannosaurus is the largest and fiercest flesh eater ever known on your planet.
Yes, for a while.
We sit back and wait for it to dematerialise.
Carry on, Sarah, I'm all ears.
You should have come to me. I know all about time travel.
Oh, are there any?
Oh, fascinating. The trouble is the Blinovitch limitation effect. If they could overcome that their problem's
What, on this planet?
Oh, yes, yes, of course. Er, let's see now, there was this this Chinese scientist called Chun Sen. Oh, hang about, he hasn't been born yet, has he.
Oh, why?
Has he indeed?
And you think he could be behind all this?
You could be right, Sarah. It's worth checking up on.
Yeah, I'd like to see the application for that grant. See the man's working papers.
Oh, Brigadier, have your fellows brought the Tardis back to UNIT HQ for me yet?
Could you give me a run down there?
Good, thanks, there's one or two things inside I think I might need.
Oh, he'll be all right for a while. You've placed guards?
Good.
Then my instruments will obtain the necessary readings. Coming?
Have you, sir?
So you've seen his working papers?
So you don't think that he could be behind what's been happening here.
Yeah, well, it's a possibility, Minister, but I can't guarantee it.
That's a good idea.
What a charming fellow. You know, it's lucky for you, Brigadier, that somebody with some sense is in charge of this operation.
Yes, quite. Where's Sarah?
Huh! Didn't look like the beginnings of a beautiful friendship to me. Oh, by the way, Brigadier? I've got to get down to the hanger. Could you lend me a jeep?
Oh.
Come on, up! Come on! Come on, get up. That's it!
It's a nasty bump. Nothing too serious. How do you feel?
She's right, you know, Brigadier. That door was bolted on the outside.
Thanks, Sergeant. Put it down there, will you? When the creature vanished, it was still in the electrical forcefield, Brigadier, so we should learn something.
And this machine's been sabotaged. There's not a single reading.
Well, at least we've learnt something, Brigadier. Somebody inside this organisation is working against us.
It was a deliberate attempt on Sarah's life.
Yes, I shall build another detector.
No, no. No, this time I'm going to try something different. I'm going to build a portable device to detect that power source.
Because, Brigadier, it cannot be as accurate or as powerful as this would have been. But it could give us the general direction.
Oh, something like a small nuclear generator.
No, he's right you know, Sarah. It is pretty unlikely, isn't it. Look, why don't you try and get some rest.
Right, I'll be getting on with it.
Sergeant? Sergeant Benton?
Look, I'll need some more electronic equipment. Can you organise it?
Ah, thanks very much. How's Miss Smith?
Er, did you give her somewhere to rest?
Oh, where?
You know, sometimes that girl baffles me.
Nothing has been achieved, General Finch, because of sabotage. Now the chains holding the Tyrannosaurus were deliberately severed, and somebody attempted to murder Miss Smith by locking her in the hanger with the creature.
To top it all, my apparatus has been messed about with. However, all that's in the past now. I've got a new scheme. So if you'll excuse me, I'll be getting on with it. Brigadier, did you bring over that new car of mine when you moved your headquarters?
Not a bit of it, Brigadier. This new car of mine is exactly what I need. Speed is of the essence, you know.
Right.
Mind the steps, Brigadier. Right, now it's through here.
Here it is.
Don't just stand there. Come on in. Close the door. Now the activating mechanism is right here.
Well, it was there, but now it seems to have gone.
Sure? Of course I'm sure.
Look, I tell you that it is there, Minister. Somewhere beneath that underground station is some kind of emergency shelter for the government.
Oh, what about?
And had it?
You'll forgive me, Minister, if I prefer to believe the evidence of my own eyes. Where did Miss Smith go to after she visited you?
Are you quite certain?
Thank you, sir.
Are you quite sure of that?
Grover was covering up because he's implicated himself.
The monsters are a side-issue, Brigadier, a device to clear central London. No, some vast scheme is underway, I'm sure of it, and it's rapidly moving towards its climax.
Get back to that underground station with explosives.
Then get it!
Who is it?
(into phone.) Hello?
Yes, who's that?
Whitaker. The man with the time travel theories. Tell me, are you responsible for these apparitions?
Where are you now?
Well look, can you get down to UNIT headquarters, it's in a ma
Oh, all right. You stay where you are. I'll come to you.
Yes, all right. I'll be with you as soon as I can. Goodbye.
Whitaker?
Whitaker? Whitaker, where are you?
Yes, and no doubt he'll be very pleased to hear it, since he arranged the whole thing.
Oh, that's just what you want, isn't it, my silence?
Yes, well now that you've caught me, General, you can end the evacuation and return your eight million Londoners, can't you.
Now listen to me, Mike. We haven't got much time. I want you to raise all the men you can muster and some kind of high explosive. Now I've got a pretty good idea where their base is.
So it was you, Mike.
Captain Yates is the man inside who's working against us.
I'm afraid it's true.
What indeed?
What?
Thank you, Sergeant Benton.
Are you ready?
(London accent) Hello Tango one. Patrol here. It's all right, we've got him. Yeah, we're bringing him in now. Listen, inform all the other units, will you? Over.
Look, face up to it, Brigadier. General Finch is involved just like Grover.
Well, Captain Yates certainly is.
Hmm. There's a note here from Sarah. There you are. Yes, she says she's got positive proof of Grover's involvement and the existence of the underground base. Here, see for yourself.
Er, Private? When was this note left?
Thank you.
There's no time for that.
Yes. Attack that underground base now.
Just what are they going to do, Mike?
Roll back time, I see. Can Whitaker really do that?
Do you realise what'll happen if they succeed?
There never was a golden age, Mike. It's all an illusion.
Whitaker's machine creates a protective field, and anyone within that field will be unaffected. Anybody outside it will just cease to exist.
Now listen to me, Mike, I
Look, I understand your ideals. In many ways I sympathise with them. But this is not the way to go about it, you know? You've got no right to take away the existence of generations of people.
Yes, there is. Take the world that you've got and try and make something of it. It's not too late.
Thank you, Sergeant.
We can't wait.
That project's going to be activated any moment now and when that happens, your reinforcements will vanish. And so will you.
Thank you.
Hang on to your hat, Brigadier.
Well, don't worry, Brigadier, I'm never wrong. If we don't get down there, there won't be a London Transport to explain to.
Good grief. It's a triceratops. Look, Brigadier, try and keep it occupied while I'm finishing this off, will you? Don't worry, they're none too bright.
Yes. Yes, nearly ready. Come on.
Right, let's take a look.
Ah, there it is. Right, I'm going down there.
No, I'd rather go on my own. It's less conspicuous. You go and get those reinforcements, will you?
On the contrary, I'm just in time to prevent an atrocity.
Keep back!
Back to their golden age. And I hope they like it.
It was for the world outside the forcefield. Your time was just frozen for a few seconds.
Quite!
Yes, well, of course he was mad. But at least he realised the dangers this planet of yours is in, Brigadier. The danger of it becoming one vast garbage dump inhabited only by rats.
It's not the the oil and the filth and the poisonous chemicals that are the real cause of pollution, Brigadier. It's simply greed.
Poor Mike.
Well, there you are, Sarah. I told you I'd get you home safely, didn't I.
Well, it's not my fault if people get up to no good while we were away.
Oh. It's a pity, that.
Well, er, I was rather thinking of making a trip to Florana.
Florana. Probably one of the most beautiful planets in the universe.
It's always carpeted with perfumed flowers.
And its seas are as warm milk and the sands as soft as swan's down.
The streams flow with water that are clearer than the clearest crystal.

Draught.
Fancy a week in ancient Mesopotamia followed by future Mars?
On the Moon.
How's the new job? Teach anything good?
Not a thing.
Whoa, whoa. We're taking off, but the engines aren't going.
No kidding.
Next time, would it kill you to knock?
Whoa! I'm just going to pop you on hold.
Why am I saluting?
Kate Lethbridge Stewart, a word to the wise. As I'm sure your father would have told you, I don't like being picked up.
(to Osgood) Nice scarf.
Unified Intelligence Task Force.
This lot. UNIT. They investigate alien stuff. Anything alien.
I work for them.
Why shouldn't I have a job? I'd be brilliant at having a job.
I do. This is my job. I'm doing it now.
I do. I do.
No more.
I know the title.
This painting doesn't belong here, not in this time or place.
It's the fall of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city.
Time Lord art. Bigger on the inside. A slice of real time, frozen.
He was there.
Me. The other me. The one I don't talk about.
I've had many faces, many lives. I don't admit to all of them. There's one life I've tried very hard to forget. He was the Doctor who fought in the Time War, and that was the day he did it. The day I did it. The day he killed them all. The last day of the Time War. The war to end all wars between my people and the Daleks. And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other, a man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me.
What happened?
A long time ago.
Allons-y! There you go, your Majesty, what did I tell you? Bigger on the inside.
You have a picnic to eat.
Well, I'm helping you eat the picnic.
Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe. But it wasn't this face. But never mind that, your Majesty. Up on your feet. Up, up.
I'm not English. Elizabeth, will you marry me?
Ah, gotcha!
One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my marriage proposal. Two, the real Elizabeth would notice when I just casually mentioned having a different face. But then the real Elizabeth isn't a shape-shifting alien from outer space. And
Ding.
It's a machine that goes ding. Made it myself. Lights up in the presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooo. Also it can microwave frozen dinners from up to twenty feet and download comics from the future. I never know when to stop.
I'm not your love, and yes you do. You're a Zygon.
Oh, stop it. It's over. A Zygon, yes. Big red rubbery thing covered in suckers. Surprisingly good kisser. Think the real Queen of England would just decide to share her throne with any old handsome bloke in a tight suit, just cos he's got amazing hair and a nice horse? Oh.
It was the horse. I'm going to be King. Run!
We're being attacked by a shape-shifting alien from outer space, formerly disguised as my horse.
It means we're going to need a new horse.
I'll hold it off. You run. Your people need you.
Oh, good work, Doctor. Nice one. The Virgin Queen? So much for history.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, very clever.
Whatever you've got planned, forget it. I'm the Doctor. I'm nine hundred and four years old. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. I am the Oncoming Storm, the Bringer of Darkness, and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you? Okay, carry on. Just a general warning.
Elizabeth!
That's what I'm trying to find out. Probably just your planet.
It's not working.
Back, both of you, now! That's a time fissure. A tear in the fabric of reality. Anything could happen.
10: For instance, a fez.
Stone dust.
In twelve hundred years I've never stepped in anything that wasn't.
Oi, you. Are you sciency?
Got a name?
Good. I've always wanted to meet someone called Yes. Now, I want this stone dust analysed. And I want a report in triplicate, with lots of graphs and diagrams and complicated sums on my desk, tomorrow morning, ASAP, pronto, L O L. See? Job. Do I have a desk?
And I want a desk.
Never gonna happen.
Interesting.
No, where it's broken from. Look at the shatter pattern. The glass on all these paintings has been broken from the inside.
So?
Lots of somethings. Dangerous.
Oh no, not now.
No, not now. I'm busy.
No, no. This is different. I remember this. Almost remember. Oh, of course. This is where I come in.
Geronimo!
Oof!
That's just what I was wondering.
Oh, that is skinny. That is proper skinny. I've never seen it from the outside. It's like a special effect. Oi!
Ha! Matchstick man.
You're not.
Compensating.
For what?
Regeneration. It's a lottery.
Oh, he's cool. Isn't he cool? I'm the Doctor and I'm all cool. Oops, I'm wearing sandshoes.
What are you doing here? I'm busy.
Oh, busy. I see. Is that what we're calling it, eh? Eh?
Hello, ladies.
Don't start.
Listen, what you get up to in the privacy of your own regeneration is your business.
One of them is a Zygon.
Urgh. I'm not judging you.
Your Majesties. Probably a good time to run.
Elizabeth, whichever one of you is the real one, turn and run in the opposite direction to the other one.
Thanks. Lovely.
Well, won't that be nice?
One of those was a Zygon.
Yeah.
Big red rubbery thing covered in suckers.
Yeah.
Venom sacs in the tongue.
Yeah, I'm getting the point, thank you.
Nice.
Ah, hello, Clara. Can you hear me?
Where are we?
England, 1562.
Myself.
Physical passage may not be possible in both directions. Its. Ah! Hang on. Fez incoming!
So where did it go?
Okay, you used to be me, you've done all this before. What happens next?
I don't remember.
How can you forget this?
Hey, hang on. It's not my fault. You're obviously not paying enough attention. Reverse the polarity!
It's not working.
We're both reversing the polarity.
Yes, I know that.
There's two of us. I'm reversing it, you're reversing it back again. We're confusing the polarity.
You. How can you be here? More to the point, why are you here?
Well, you've certainly come to the right place.
His companions?
Yeah.
Really.
Yep.
Yes!
Still, loving the posh gravelly thing. It's very convincing.
Brave words, Dick van Dyke.
Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, that is witchcraft. Yes, yes, yes. Witchy witchcraft. Hello? Hello in there. Excuse me. Hello!
Am I talking to the wicked witch of the well?
Clara?
Clara, hi, hello. Hello. Would you mind telling these prattling mortals to get themselves begone?
Yes, tiny bit more colour.
Ooo, frogs. Nice. You heard her.
It's a timey-wimey thing.
I've no idea where he picks that stuff up.
Which one are you? What happened to the other one?
That is not the Queen of England, that's an alien duplicate.
And you can take it from him, cos he's really checked.
Oh, shut up.
Venom sacs in the tongue.
Seriously, stop it.
No, hang on. The Tower.
Did you say the Tower? Ah, yes, brilliant. Love the Tower.
Breakfast at eight, please. Will there be Wi-Fi?
Yes. No. I demand to be incarcerated in the Tower immediately with my co-conspirators Sandshoes and Granddad.
They're not sandshoes.
Three of us in one cell? That's going to cause some nasty anomalies if we don't get out soon.
What are you doing?
Getting us out.
The sonic won't work on that, it's too primitive.
Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape?
Okay, so the Queen of England is now a Zygon. But never mind that. Why are we all together? Why are we all here? Well, me and Chinny, we were surprised, but you came looking for us. You knew it was going to happen. Who told you?
Oi, Chinny?
Yeah, you do have a chin.
We'd have to calculate the exact harmonic resonance of the entire structure down to a sub-atomic level. Even the sonic would take years.
It must be really recent for you.
The Time War. The last day. The day you killed them all.
The day we killed them all.
Same thing.
You're not talking about it. There's no one else here.
Count what?
I have absolutely no idea.
Ah, I don't know. I lose track. Twelve hundred and something, I think, unless I'm lying. I can't remember if I'm lying about my age, that's how old I am.
Tell me, what would be the point?
Two point four seven billion.
You forgot? Four hundred years, is that all it takes?
I moved on.
Where? Where can you be now that you can forget something like that?
Spoilers.
No. No, no, no. For once I would like to know where I'm going.
No, you really wouldn't.
No?
Is something funny? Did I miss a funny thing?
Sorry. It just occured to me. This is what I'm like when I'm alone.
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
So.
Yeah, still going.
Calculation complete.
Hey, four hundred years in four seconds. We may have had our differences, which is frankly odd in the circumstances, but, I tell you what, boys. We are incredibly clever.
How did you do that?
Right.
Yes. You've met them before. Don't you remember?
Thanks.
Yes. Exactly. Why wasn't it locked?
Suspended animation. Oh, that's very good. The Zygons all pop inside the pictures, wait a few centuries till the planet's a bit more interesting, and then out they come.
You see, Clara, they're stored in the paintings in the Under Gallery, like cup-a-soups. Except you add time, if you can picture that. Nobody could picture that. Forget I said cup-a-soups.
Exactly.
And do you know why I know that you're a fake? Because you're such a bad copy. It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing hair, or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes just a bit too close together, or the breath that could stun a horse. It's because my Elizabeth, the real Elizabeth, would never be stupid enough to reveal her own plan. Honestly, why would you do that?
Okay. So, backtracking a moment just to lend context to my earlier remarks.
Well, I'm going to need my Tardis.
Ah.
It does start to happen, yeah.
I will be right back.
Right then, back to the future.
Ah, it's his grunge phase. He grows out of it.
Don't you listen to them.
Ow! The desktop is glitching.
Hey, look. The round things.
I love the round things.
What are the round things?
No idea.
Oh dear, the friction contrafibulator. Ha! There, stabilised.
(channelling Doctor 2) Oh, you've redecorated. I don't like it.
Oh. Oh yeah? Oh, you never do. Listen, we're going to the National Gallery. The Zygons are underneath it.
Science leads, Kate. Is that what you meant? Is that what your father meant?
Space-Time Telegraph, Kate. A gift from me to your father, hotline straight to the Tardis.
I know about the Black Archive and I know about the security protocol. Kate, please. Please tell me you are not about to do something unbelievably stupid.
Not as sorry as you will be. This is not a decision you will ever be able to live with.
Kate, we're trying to bring the Tardis in. Why can't we land?
No, Kate, please. Just listen to me!
The Tower of London, totally Tardis-proof.
Alien technology plus human stupidity. Trust me, it's unbeatable.
Yeah, we do. A tiny bit. Try and keep up.
What happened?
Take a look at your phone and confirm who you're talking to.
You were just talking to me. I know. I'm a time traveller, figure it out. I need you to send the Gallifrey Falls painting to the Black Archive. Understood?
I'm the Doctor.
Sorry about the Dalek.
Kate Lethbridge Stewart, what in the name of sanity are you doing?
Except make you both agree to halt it.
Once. Turned me into the man I am now. I'm not even sure who that is any more.
You tell yourself it's justified, but it's a lie. Because what I did that day was wrong. Just wrong.
And, because I got it wrong, I'm going to make you get it right.
Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both of you, together.
Then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty of all time.
Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides.
And the key to perfect negotiation?
Not knowing what side you're on.
So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out
No one in this room will be able to remember if they're human
Or Zygon.
Whoops a daisy.
Peace in our time.
These events should be time-locked. We shouldn't even be here.
So something let us through.
All those years, burying you in my memory.
Pretending you didn't exist. Keeping you a secret, even from myself.
Pretending you weren't the Doctor, when you were the Doctor more than anybody else.
You were the Doctor on the day it wasn't possible to get it right.
But this time
You don't have to do it alone.
What we do today is not out of fear or hatred. It is done because there is no other way.
And it is done in the name of the many live we are failing to save.
What? What is it? What?
No, it's something. Tell me.
There isn't anything we can do.
He's right. There isn't another way. There never was. Either I destroy my own people or let the universe burn.
And what am I?
Yes. Maybe, yes.
Then what do I do?
Never cruel or cowardly.
You're not actually suggesting that we change our own personal history?
We change history all the time. I'm suggesting far worse.
Gentlemen, I have had four hundred years to think about this. I've changed my mind.
Yeah, there is. There is.
But there's something those billion billion Daleks don't know.
Because if they did, they'd probably send for reinforcements.
This time, there's three of us.
Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting that too! That is brilliant!
Ha, ha, ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries.
Eh? Who did?
Sorry, did you just say Bad Wolf?
The Sky Trench is holding, but what if the whole planet just disappeared?
The Daleks would be firing on each other. They'd destroy themselves in their own crossfire.
Frozen. Frozen in an instant of time, safe and hidden away.
Exactly.
Hello, hello, Gallifrey High Command, this is the Doctor speaking.
Hello! Also the Doctor. Can you hear me?
General, we have a plan.
We should point at this moment, it is a fairly terrible plan
And almost certainly won't work.
I was happy with fairly terrible.
Sorry, just thinking out loud.
We're flying our three Tardises into your lower atmosphere.
We're positioned at equidistant intervals around the globe. Equidistant. So grown up.
We're going to freeze Gallifrey.
Using our Tardises, we're going to freeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time.
Except we're going to do it to a whole planet.
And all the people on it.
Because the alternative is burning.
And I've seen that.
And I never want to see it again.
You would have hope. And right now, that is exactly what you don't have.
Oh, hundreds and hundreds.
But don't worry, I started a very long time ago.
Calling the War Council of Gallifrey. This is the Doctor.
You might say I've been doing this all my lives.
Good luck.
Standing by.
Ready.
Commencing calculations.
Soon be there.
Across the boundaries that divide one universe from another.
Just got to lock on to his coordinates.
And for my next trick.
Okay. Gentlemen, we're ready. Geronimo!
Allons-y!
What is it actually called?
Well, there's some debate. Either No More or Gallifrey Falls.
How did it get here?
No idea.
There's always something we don't know, isn't there?
Likewise.
Doctor.
The time streams are out of sync. You can't retain it, no.
I won't remember either, so you might as well tell me.
Tell you what?
Where it is we're going that you don't want to talk about.
I saw Trenzalore, where we're buried. We die in battle among millions.
That's not how it's supposed to be.
That's how the story ends. Nothing we can do about it. Trenzalore is where you're going.
Oh, never say nothing. Anyway, good to know my future is in safe hands. Keep a tight hold on it, Clara.
Trenzalore. We need a new destination, because I don't want to go.
He always says that.
How did you know?
Ah.
I could be a curator. I'd be great at curating. I'd be the Great Curator. I could retire and do that. I could retire and be the curator of this place.
I never forget a face.
Which title? There's two. No More or Gallifrey Falls.
That Gallifrey didn't fall. It worked. It's still out there.
Then where is it?
Do I?
Is that what I'm supposed to do now? Go looking for Gallifrey?
Thank you very much.
Clara sometimes asks me if I dream. Of course I dream, I tell her. Everybody dreams. But what do you dream about, she'll ask. The same thing everybody dreams about, I tell her. I dream about where I'm going. She always laughs at that. But you're not going anywhere, you're just wandering about.
That's not true. Not any more. I have a new destination. My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyones. It's taken me so many years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going.
Where I've always been going. Home, the long way round.

A horned dinosaur with a mouth like a beak? The Brigadier saw one in the London Underground once.
Met quite a few actually.
Lots of pterodactyls.
Perhaps we should make a little visit sometime.
A very good time for dinosaurs.
A planet, an Earth colony, settled some centuries in your future. Do you like it?
No, neither do I. Why not?
Yes, I've been hearing disturbing rumours about Terra Alpha, so I decided to look in some time.
Tonight's the night. Rumours of something evil, and we're going to get to the bottom of it.
Yes, it makes you wonder how the natives stand it.
Ah, there's one.
What's in a name?
Now that you come to mention it. You must forgive my young friend, Ace, Mister er. Er, you didn't tell me your name.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Thank you, Trevor Sigma. Actually, my nickname at college was Theta Sigma.
Well?
Definitely. Something very nasty's happening here, and we've got to put a stop to it, quickly.
Tonight.
Yes.
First, we'll try and get ourselves arrested.
Yes, it looks good.
On the contrary. Just admiring your handiwork. Huh, miserable looking thing, wasn't it?
Oh, I say she is, relatively speaking, given the deeply distressing nature of so many fundamental universal truths.
Well, she's happy and I'm happy.
We're visitors, just here for the night.
Sorry?
Badges.
Yes, I believe all offworld personnel are issued with badges at customs.
She's got badges.
Oh dear, I don't seem to have one.
What does that mean?
Ah. Hold the two bananas and nudge. Never fails.
I see what you mean. The delivery's terrible.
You're right. It's awful. It's tasteless, smug, and worst of all, it's badly constructed, I mean, who writes that stuff?
Excuse me?
Is this a prison?
So there's absolutely no chance whatsoever that this could be a place of incarceration, and we're free to leave at any time.
So what you're telling me is that Helen A punishes anyone for wearing dark clothes?
This is terrible.
Remember the Happiness Patrol, Ace.
Ratbags with guns.
He sounds like a sweetie.
Dangerous?
What else does he do, this Kandyman?
Well, we have a night's work ahead of us and I think we've learned enough.
Waiting zone break, but I think we'll take our new found friend with us.
Shush.
Hold it, Ace.
Save it, save it. You can't run. You're no good to me like this.
Don't worry, Ace, we will.
Tell me.
I was wondering about your go-cart.
Yes. I was wondering, if we were to get into it and drive off, what would you do?
Nothing?
Wouldn't raise the alarm? Shoot us?
You're right. It's booby-trapped.
Nothing.
Yes.
No, stop it.
I'm trying to defuse it.
I'm trying not to get us blown to pieces.
Shush.
Start the engine. You can drive.
I need a little more time.
Ow! That's it.
Ace? At least the Happiness Patrol left us in peace. Ace?
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to have a spare automotive jack on you, would you?
I'm looking for Helen A. Perhaps you would point me in the right direction?
Smiling?
Yes, I have heard rumours.
But why?
I'm not distressed, I'm angry. Why don't people stand up to her?
Ah, the Kandyman. He's next on my list of people to see.
Of course.
Oh, thank you, Silas P.
Happiness Patrol Undercover. Oh, excellent. Perhaps you could take a message?
You must be a musician.
Your timing's good.
I'm the Doctor.
A subtle musician.
What does the Sigma stand for?
And you're travelling through the colonies.
It's an interesting planet from the psychological standpoint.
No, this way. There's someone I'd like to meet.
I believe it's where they make sweets.
I'm sure the pleasure's all ours.
May we enquire what it is?
I didn't know you were the caring type.
Before you start, there is something I wanted to ask you about that's been worrying me. It's the executions.
Well, out there, people don't seem to know what method you use. I was intrigued.
I was just curious.
Depraved.
Is there any way of stopping it once it starts moving?
Er, you said soft centre?
Yes, you said soft centre instead of heart. What is your heart made of?
Ah! A movable feast, eh?
So you're perfectly adapted to your environment.
Protected against everything. That is, except from the intense heat from that open oven behind you.
I said, protected against everything except for the intense heat from the open oven behind you.
And, of course, the adhesive effect of carbonated H2O and citric acid. Lemonade, to you.
Sweet dreams.
It's crystallised sugar. This pipe must have carried some sort of syrup. What do you think?
So it's certainly past its best, so we can assume that nothing's been pumped down here for some time. I wonder why? How would you describe the Kandyman's confection?
Ah, yeah. Delicious.
Wait until we're in another section.
There's tons of crystallised syrup above us.
Not any noise, just certain noises.
Oh look. Some sort of footprint.
Their kind of creature.
No weapons. Just a brolly.
What did you say?
He's been taking lessons. So you've met my friend Ace?
That sounds like Ace. Brave girl, captive. If only she'd listen to what I tell her.
Gordon?
Well, they may not look like it, but they're on the edge of starvation. No sugar in the pipes.
They used to, but they were driven down here by human settlers.
Yes, us. Ah, here we are. Seventh manhole on the right. I'll go first. It's been a privilege. We shall return.
I'm the Doctor. Have we met?
You're Trevor Sigma, aren't you.
You ask the questions?
Which one?
That's classified information. Name?
I ask the questions.
Name?
Address?
Questionnaire. Occupation?
Good. Take me to the leader.
I'll find you later.
The brandy of the damned.
Enough of the little.
Melancholy?
It's no pleasure, I can assure you.
I'm sorry, that's classified information. I understand you're responsible for this planet?
And is it a happy planet?
Some people on Terra Alpha are very difficult to find.
I'm sorry, he's not allowed to answer that.
Which were?
I'm sure you have.
And did you use the Bureau's programme?
He can't. He has a prior engagement.
Remember, Trevor, I ask the questions.
Population control?
And which member of the population are you controlling today, just for the record.
And how did she disappoint you, eh? Oh, no, no, don't answer, no, no. She enjoyed the feel of rain upon her face. Or perhaps her favourite season was the autumn.
Was that question?
Good. I'm the Doctor. Still no luck? I'd have that seen to if I were you.
Ah, thank you.
That sounds like a three star brandy to me.
Ooo, I'd like to talk to them.
Oh dear, I'd better hurry. I've got to get to the Kandy Kitchen.
Don't worry, I'll deal with the snipers.
Hello.
Yes, I imagine you will. You like guns, don't you.
No. In fact, let him come a little closer.
Why? Scared? Why should you be scared? You're the one with the gun.
You like guns, don't you.
Of course he will. That's what guns are for. Pull the trigger, end a life. Simple, isn't it.
Makes sense, doesn't it.
A life killing life.
Shut up. Why don't you do it then? Look me in the eye, pull the trigger, end my life. Why not?
Why not?
No, you don't, do you.
Throw away your gun.
Kandyman, don't let the Happiness Patrol see you looking like that. A big smile, please.
I'll unstick you if you divert the flow.
Of course.
I thought you might have said that.
Oh well, here we go again.
Yes, well, it's been a busy one for me.
I've lost my friend Ace.
I think I know where to find her.
When's the show open?
Five minutes? Why are they only putting the posters up now?
Run and get the demonstrators and bring them to the Forum.
You'll find a way. I'll meet you here later.
I want to find out if there's an artist appearing in the Forum tonight.
Her name is Ace.
Yes.
Do?
She makes things disappear.
(sotto) Nothing magical about the way she does it.
What does that mean? No, don't tell me. If she survives, it's a miracle.
Trevor Sigma. Come to see the fun? Or is that classified information?
Oh, is that it? And where are the Census Bureau going to send you next?
Once or twice.
You're making me feel nostalgic. Wait a minute. You can't give them these names. I know them. Harold V, Silas P. They might have lived here once, but
How long is it since you were last on this planet?
So, this represents six months worth of Helen A's handiwork. A list of the disappeared.
It's still the same old story, a fight for love or glory, a case of do or die.
Earl.
Thank you, Earl. Everything's beginning to fall into place. As time goes by.
You're late.
You don't know how happy I am to see you, Ace!
It's all right, Ace. They can't shoot me because they see before them a happy man! And their logic tells them, twisted though it be, that as such they have no power over me. I may have been some time ago a little grouchy, perhaps, a little bad-tempered, but not today. No, because today the Doctor and the drones are having a ball!
You can't do it, Happiness Patrol section B. You can't go down in the history of the galaxy as a bunch of partypoopers. The only killjoys in this square are behind you!
They're just wallowing in their own
Weltschmertz. All except Susan Q and Ace, who are happy to see me!
Very happy.
To the top.
Ah, Wulfric, Wences.
That sounds like a Stigorax. I haven't met one since I was in Birmingham in the twenty fifth century. Ruthless, intelligent predators.
Fifi? That wouldn't be Fifi as in Fifi the annoyed rat you claim to have blown to smithereens?
Including Fifi.
This way, I think.
Precisely.
Shush. Whisper.
Hardly any loud noise, just certain loud noises.
I want you to go down the other end with the Pipe People.
Take Susie Q with you. Come on. Run!
Earl, give me an A flat.
No, A flat.
Resonance. Sympathetic vibrations. Haven't you read the paper of Doctor John Wallace to the Royal Society in 1677? Quickly.
Wrong note. Er, give me a C.
Yes. Keep playing.
Kandyman, I don't believe you've met my young friend, Ace. An expert in calorification, incineration, carbonisation and inflammation.
She's come to look at your oven.
That may be, Kandyman, but the last time we met you said you were going to kill me.
I agree, you are a pimple head.
Tails. Well?
You're playing a dangerous game, Kandyman. That red-hot poker could cut through you like a knife through butterscotch.
Quick, Ace. Open the oven door!
Oh, he'll keep. He's full of colouring, flavouring and preservative.
Ah, not quite. I can hear the sound of empires toppling.
Wanton destruction of public property? Certainly not.
Yes, this is where we get in.
Okay, Wences, this is the point at which we must say goodbye.
No protests. Soon you'll be back in the sugar fields.
Yes. It sounds like a shuttle.
Ah, I was looking for Helen A. Perhaps you could tell her
Susan Q. Who taught you to shoot like that?
Oh, thank you, Daisy K.
Splendid.
You can't get away, Helen A.
Oh, I know I can't, but it's not me you're running away from.
Yourself. That's why you'll never escape.
Oh, they understood you only too well. That's why they resisted you.
The best? Prisons? Death squads? Executions?
Don't you ever feel like weeping, Helen A?
Why?
What were these opportunities you gave them? A bag of sweets? A few tawdry party games? Bland, soulless music? Do these things make you happy? Of course they don't. Because they're cosmetic. Happiness is nothing unless it exists side by side with sadness.
Two sides, one coin.
I'm sure you will, Helen A.
Where there is no compassion.
A place where there is no love.
Fifi?
'Tis done.
It's been a long night and I think we ought to be off. What about you, Earl?
Hmm?
Oh, yes. There are no other colours without the blues.
Happiness will prevail.

Oh. A bit ahead of schedule. When was your flight again?
February the twenty eighth, 1981. Oh, you'll have time for a cup of tea. It's only sixteen fifteen hours.
Last time I was there, they were doing strange things to Terminal three. Oh. No, you're right. It doesn't.
Oh, Adric's just showing off. He means the Milky Way, your galaxy. Ha! Massive magnetic field shift.
I suppose it could be part of the Piccadilly Line.
No. No, no, wait, wait, wait. The atmosphere's wrong.
Diminution of oxygen, nitrogen, traces of mercurial compound, intense proton activity.
Er, I'm going to take a look around. Now, none of you is to leave here. Is that clearly understood? Good.
Spaceship or laboratory?
Well, we're in motion, so we can be pretty sure it's a spaceship.
Patience.
And it appears to be unmanned. Adric, through there, space packs. No need to bother with the visors.
There's a lot to interest you out there, young lady. Highly advanced, innovative stuff.
Yes. There appears to be nothing but machinery out there, but we are under scrutiny. There's a monopticon out there.
Well, I suppose it would be best described as a sort of mobile black eye with a hypnotic stare.
Whoever or whatever is running this ship knows we're here, so we'll have a little scrutiny for ourselves. Should we meet anyone, you take your cue from me. (to Tegan) Spare key. Should we be separated, we come back here.
Yes, if you like, stay here. Adric?
Hello, again. You must be having a ball.
Friends of mine.
Amazing work. Worthy of Gallifrey. Non-corrosive alloys, saturated polymers. Highly advanced.
Yes! An interferometer.
But we could use it on the time curve circuits.
Belts and braces.
Yes. That's what's interesting. See if you can get it going.
Ah, magnetic shield. Ahem. I mean you no harm. I wonder, could you tell me who or what you are? And where we are?
I, er, I know we're trespassing, but I would like an opportunity to explain the circumstances, if you'd be so kind.
So, your lips are sealed. Well, would it be in order for you to take me to your leader? If you have a leader, that is.
Oh. Well, that's a friendly gesture. Thank you. Er, perhaps one of us should stay with Nyssa, Adric.
Good man. Come on. We'll see you both later.
Ah, a twib.
Thank you.
Here we are.
You look as if you might be.
Enlightenment, how do you do.
Friendly, I hope.
I am the Doctor.
Of everything.
A Gallifreyan. Tegan is an Earthling, Adric is an Alzarian, and Nyssa there is from Traken.)
Of course. And inadvertently, as a matter of fact.
Thank you. May I ask who you are?
Goodness me, you are a long way from home.
You're very kind.
You know, I drop in from time to time myself, and nothing on Earth changes quite so often as the fashion. You wouldn't believe the way some people look. Some of them even wear safety pins.
Earrings.
Yes. A lot of it about.
Drop in times?
Yes, I promised to put Tegan on her plane.
Yes, in a sense. They go from Heathrow Airport.
No, not even the quarantine area.
An error. My assistant miscalculated the coordinates.
Or it could have been your dense magnetic field causing a fluctuation of my artron energy.
Yes. Silly, isn't it. Only my professor at the Academy seemed to understand it. Just goes to show how academic everything is.
Come on, Adric, explain the formula.
Come along, children. Not in front of our hosts.
Thank you, Monarch.
Majesty.
I'm sure she's all right.
What did I tell you?
Ah, there you are. That's reassuring.
Hello. I'm the Doctor. This is Tegan, Adric and Nyssa.
Are you an Earthling?
Greek?
What are you doing here?
Salt. If you're an Earthling, how do you come to be on this ship?
You speak the dialect?
Well, I know that. What's he saying?
What's he doing here?
Sorry to interrupt.
The dreaming?
When does he expect to get there?
Is that where you're going?
No, of course you're not.
How do you do, your Highness.
Who are her people?
Goodness, that's going back a bit.
Greetings.
Well, I'd never have guessed it. You look in the best of health to me.
You're all Earthlings. What are you doing on this ship? Are you hostages, is that it?
Well, Bigon?
No.
Well, that's very civil of His Majesty. Who are you?
Goodness, how you've changed.
Magical.
But you have.
Well, we must read your history books.
One couldn't wish for a more enchanting teacher.
Enlightenment.
Yes, of course. And you must be Minister of Persuasion.
May one ask the purpose of your journey to planet Earth?
Many of you?
Yes, well.
I see. So we've accepted your invitation?
Au revoir.
I hope we're not putting you out.
You're with your family?
Seems young for his age, don't you think?
On the face of it.
Oh, I don't anticipate a great deal of difficulty.
I knew a sailor once, friend of mine, chap named Drake.
He said something like, there's time enough to get to Terminal three and beat the Armada too.
Could there really be more than one of these?
If our conversation is to remain private, yes.
She didn't talk of people, she talked of population.
Sloppy thinking, Adric. Do you know there are at least three billion bacteria in this chamber alone? And if a frog with a funny head can turn itself into a semblance of a human being in a matter of minutes, there isn't much of a limit to what it can't do. To say nothing of the dress-making.
I am beginning to wonder. I mean, here we are, four days from Earth on a spaceship with three billion and three frogs. And four Earthlings. Why? Wait a minute, wait a minute. How long is one hundred generations?
Call it twenty five.
Right. Right. So it's at least two thousand five hundred years since our hosts last visited Earth when they rescued Bigon. Now, if the return journey to Urbanka takes the same time as the journey to Earth. How's your ancient history, Tegan?
Well, not to worry, mine's pretty good. Now, the Futu dynasty in China I would put at four thousand years ago, the Mayans in South American flourished eight thousand years ago, and Kurkutji the aborigine says it's so long since he was taken he can't remember. How about twelve thousand years?
Yes, so you keep saying, Tegan. Is anyone saying you're wrong?
Or maybe Tegan's right. Why do it?
No, but his ancestor was. Wouldn't be the first time that whole generations have known of no other life than a spaceship.
I'm saying that the Urbankans have visited Earth four times and taken at least one cultural representative, and this time they're coming for good. Well, I say good. Three billion Earthlings plus three billion Urbankans, I really don't think so. I really don't think so at all.
Explore.
Bring these.
Hmm. I get the feeling we were meant to lose them.
Oh? What do you suggest? Come on, and try to keep calm. We'll get nowhere if you lose your head.
More Earthlings. Hello? Some sort of entertainment.
Thank you.
I'm afraid they've got lost. You know what children are.
How is Urbanka represented?
No, no, no, no. As Percy over there said, they can't be far.
Why should they?
Nonsense. Wouldn't make any sense.
Well, take the advice of a mad man and look happy.
Try to look as if you're enjoying yourself. In these situations it's the best form of defence. And it gives me time to think.
I fancy I've made our quarters private enough.
I'll do my best.
Act up to me.
Quite all right, thank you. Just a dizzy spell. Must be the altitude.
A little diversion. I think we're on to something. Bigon wants to talk to me.
I can't say I share your taste in entertainment.
Four visits, every four thousand years or so.
How can organic life endure that long?
Incredible engineering.
Exactly. Just three silicon chips.
Oh, a thousand millionth of a metre.
Well, like it or not, Tegan, you're looking at a fact, if not a fact of life. This ship contains the entire population of Urbanka. Nine billion silicon chips.
So, the Aborigine, the Chinaman and the Mayan are
So it would seem. As long as you have spare parts you could go on forever.
All you need is the raw materials.
Of course! That's it, he's after the silicon.
One of the biggest components of the Earth's crust is silicon. All the chips he wants.
Oh yes, carbon too.
I thought he said Urbanka's son was a supernova?
And all this for what?
What?
Absurd. So he believes that to travel faster than light would mean going backwards in time, back to the Big Bang?
If you feel this way, why have you not acted before?
Well, the only course of action I can think of is to go along with him. Appear to cooperate.
It's all right, it's all right. Just leave everything to me.
Could you perhaps show me the part of the ship that controls the population? All the information you can.
Just keep calm.
Not yet. Please, will you stop thinking of yourself for once!
Of what? Who'll believe us? We'll be laughed at.
Yes, another way.
Yes, just coming. Now stay here. You'll be perfectly safe. I won't be very long.
Yes, you will! In here you can't be seen, out there you can. You stay here! (to Bigon) Go a little in front of me. That will tell them not to confront me and I can surprise it.
Shush.
Yes, and that's the way we'll deal with them all. Come on.
Is the course controlled from here?
What are these doing?
Intensified ultraviolet for photosynthesis.
And now it's a source of oxygen.
Point taken.
There were others?
And the frogs?
An appalling thought.
It's a tall order.
Nyssa, wake up.
Are you all right?
Yes, the devils. Where's Adric?
Oh, do they.
Could we expect support from the others, Kurkutji and Futu?
Yes, difficult to resist.
Is there nowhere we could hide ourselves to get a plan together?
No weapons?
Then our only hope is to get to the Tardis and warn Earth. Might these be of any use to us?
What for?
Yes.
Oh, good grief.
Ah, yes, I
I think I will, yes.
Oh, thank you, Nyssa. It was brilliant, by the way. Quite brilliant.
Eye glass. I'm a bit short-sighted in this one.
It's a piece of string.
It's a cricket ball. A memento. I used to bowl a very good chinaman.
I took five wickets once for New South Wales.
I can't think why.
Oh, is it usual for a host to kill a guest?
My actions were motivated by scientific curiosity.
Reports can be garbled, your Majesty.
I wouldn't dream of interfering with your monopticons.
Thank you, your Majesty.
Adric, I'm sorry. I really am.
I know, I know, and that's what I'm sorry about. You know, I think I may have been entirely mistaken about Monarch.
Oh, he's an autocrat, of course, but I now believe a benevolent one.
And he's ruthless. Anyone can see that.
All great leaders have to be ruthless. It's the intention, the mission
The sheer
Breadth of vision, that's the important thing.
I mean, he could quite easily have had me killed. Now why didn't he?
I know, and that's what I'm sorry about. That's why at the earliest opportunity I shall request permission to see him, seek an audience and make my peace with him.
Come on, let's go and see a bit of the recreational.
Now listen to me, you young idiot. You're not so much gullible as idealistic. I suppose it comes from your deprived delinquent background. Monarch is the greatest being in the known universe for evil. He will destroy Earth and much more if he's not stopped.
Yes, back there he could hear us. Here he can't. I'm playing for time.
Do you want to save Nyssa?
Then shut up and listen. He is not concerned with bringing civilisation. He has the greatest contempt for anyone but himself. He wants to rob Earth of its minerals in order to travel faster than the speed of light.
All right, all right, if that doesn't convince you, why does he carry poison on his ship?
It's stored in the Mobiliary. If his mission is peaceful, why does he want the poison?
Do you really think that?
Because he doesn't want to upset you yet.
Look, he wants to use you. His subjects are all synthetic. You are flesh and blood. If you speak up for him on Earth, you can delay their opposition.
No, you don't, do you. Look, the Urbankans are synthetic. They are not like you and me. However sophisticated their circuitry, they are still machines. With me?
Well, make up your mind. We haven't much time.
I haven't the slightest intention of telling you until I know if you're with me.
I don't believe it.
That's good. With any luck, they haven't put this one right yet.
Get some allies. This door leads to the Mobiliary. Nyssa's in here. Now, with this (magnifying glass) I can distract the monopticon without disabling it. It won't scan us but neither will it draw attention to us. Be ready to take over from me when we get inside.
Now, it's important to hold it steady. It has a cobalt ring with a high flux density.
Saving your life, I hope.
No! No, hear me out. You are in great danger.
You must know all I say is true. Put them back. Bigon must have them back.
You must. Lin Futu, you are a very old and wise man. You have been promised leadership of your people on Earth.
Do you think for one moment that Monarch will honour that? The Chinese are the most populous and powerful race on Earth. Once Monarch grasps that, what hope is there for you?
Leave that to me. Will your dragon dance be included in the recreational?
Then let it be next.
Wake up, Nyssa. Nyssa! Nyssa!
What about the Princess and Kurkutji?
Well, somehow I must get to the Tardis. There are hatches. I must try to get to it on a lifeline.
Oh, no, no, no, that won't do for the temperature out there. And anyway, I'll need your help.
Splendid. Adric. I can use this, (the helmet) but we have only six minutes. That's as long as I can stand sub-zero temperatures.
What about the androids? Have you control of them all?
Well, is there no way to break the contact?
No, there's no time. Anyway, you'd be seen.
Can you arrange a collective activity?
You're spoiling my concentration. Come on, old girl. Just don't let me down now. Don't let me down now.
Bring that (his helmet) and bring another.
Rescuing Nyssa and Adric. Look, just do what I say and do it quickly!
Quick! Run!
Ah. Had the feeling he might.
Save your breath. You two, put these on. And you, Adric. Have you another helmet?
Well, assemble it quickly.
I can go into a trance which reduces the need for oxygen. Ah!
Thank you. Bigon?
Can you change the course of this ship?
Urbanka.
Monarch's poison, the last dangerous thing on this ship. Be very careful with it. I want to analyse it.
I'd go home if I were you.
You don't stand an earthly where we're going.
Well, come on, come on. I'm taking you back to Earth.
Oh, it's quite all right. He needs the atmosphere as much as we do.
Hence the Flora chamber.
Partly, anyway. The poison only works on organic matter.
You know, I had my doubts about anyone who wants to go backwards in time by travelling faster than the speed of light. It's impossible. Fallacy of flesh time.
Yes, all right. (to Bigon) Are you coming?
Good luck.
I suppose it would have been a bit difficult placing Bigon and the others.
Heathrow, here we come.
Nyssa?

Time travel without a capsule. That's a killer.
That wasn't luck, that was me.
Hold still! Don't move! Hold it still!
That's because you didn't have me. Martha, grab hold, now!
No, he's here. Trust me.
I'll know him, the moment I see him. Time Lords always do.
That's him. He's Prime Minister.
The Master is Prime Minister of Great Britain. The Master and his wife?
What have you got? Computer, laptop, anything. Jack, who are you phoning? You can't tell anyone we're here.
We went flying all around the universe while he was here all the time.
He's a Time Lord.
That's all you need to know. Come on, show me Harold Saxon.
Oh, thanks.
No.
When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do was fuse the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can only travel between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis landed. Which is right here, right now.
Well, eighteen months, tops. The most he could have been here is eighteen months. So how has he managed all this? The Master was always sort of hypnotic, but this is on a massive scale.
Really?
Why do you say that? What was his policy? What did he stand for?
What's that?
That. That tapping, that rhythm. What are you doing?
Our lord and master is speaking to his kingdom.
What?
Out!
All right?
Martha? What are you doing?
Don't tell them anything.
That's exactly what they want. It's a trap!
Corner!
Martha, reverse.
Get out, now!
Careful! JACK: Martha, listen to me. Do as I say. We've got to ditch this car. Pull over. Right now!
Martha, come on!
I'm here.
Master.
You chose it. Psychiatrist's field day.
So, Prime Minister, then.
Who are those creatures? Because there's no such thing as the Toclafane. It's just a made up name, like the Bogeyman.
Gone.
It burnt.
Dead. And the Daleks, more or less. What happened to you?
I know.
I was the only one who could end it. And I tried. I did. I tried everything.
Stop it!
I've been alone ever since. But not anymore. Don't you see? All we've got is each other.
You could stop this right now. We could leave this planet. We can fight across the constellations, if that's what you want, but not on Earth.
Why do you say that?
I could help you. Please, let me help.
What have you done? Tell me how you've done this. What are those creatures? Tell me!
Stop it. Answer me.
He can see us.
He's got control of everything.
We run.
It still says the Jones family taken in for questioning. Tell you what, though. No mention of Leo.
Actually, they're not bad.
A friend, at first.
You've been watching too much TV.
Well, perfect to look at, maybe. And it was. It was beautiful. They used to call it the Shining World of the Seven Systems. And on the Continent of Wild Endeavour, in the Mountains of Solace and Solitude, there stood the Citadel of the Time Lords, the oldest and most mighty race in the universe, looking down on the galaxies below. Sworn never to interfere, only to watch. Children of Gallifrey, taken from their families age of eight to enter the Academy. And some say that's when it all began. When he was a child. That's when the Master saw eternity. As a novice, he was taken for initiation. He stood in front of the Untempered Schism. It's a gap in the fabric of reality through which could be seen the whole of the vortex. You stand there, eight years old, staring at the raw power of time and space, just a child. Some would be inspired, some would run away, and some would go mad. Brr. I don't know.
Oh, the ones that ran away, I never stopped.
Patch it through to the laptop.
You work for Torchwood.
Everything Torchwood did, and you're part of it?
What's the Archangel Network?
It's in the phones! Oh, I said he was a hypnotist. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
There it is. That rhythm, it's everywhere, ticking away in the subconscious.
No, no, no, no, no. It's subtler than that. Any stronger and people would question it. But contained in that rhythm, in layers of code, Vote Saxon. Believe in me. Whispering to the world. Oh, yes! That's how he hid himself from me, because I should have sensed there was another Time Lord on Earth. I should have known way back. The signal cancelled him out.
Not from down here. But now we know how he's doing it.
Oh, yes!
Three Tardis keys. Three pieces of the Tardis, all with low level perception properties because the Tardis is designed to blend in. Well, sort of. But now, the Archangel Network's got a second low level signal. Weld the key to the network and Martha, look at me. You can see me, yes?
What about now?
No, I'm here. Look at me.
And back again. See? It just shifts your perception a tiny little bit. Doesn't make us invisible, just unnoticed. Oh, I know what it's like. It's like, it's like when you fancy someone and they don't even know you exist. That's what it's like. Come on.
Don't run, don't shout. Just keep your voice down. Draw attention to yourself and the spell is broken. Just keep to the shadows.
Yeah, that's what we are. Ghosts.
Don't move.
Don't.
Now that sounds like Torchwood.
He's a Time Lord, which makes him my responsibility. I'm not here to kill him. I'm here to save him.
Does that thing work as a teleport?
No, wait. Shush, shush, shush, shush. Can't you hear it?
Brilliant. This way.
Oh, at last!
Don't touch it.
It can't be. No, no, no, no, no, no, it can't be.
He's cannibalised the Tardis.
It's a paradox machine.
As soon as this hits red, it activates. At this speed, it'll trigger at two minutes past eight.
Not till I know what it's doing. Touch the wrong bit, blow up the solar system.
Oh, I've got a way. Sorry, didn't I mention it?
If I can get this around the Master's neck, cancel out his perception, they'll see him for real. It's just hard to go unnoticed with everyone on red alert. If they stop me you've got a key.
Stop it! Stop it now!
Master, just calm down. Just look at what you're doing. Just stop. If you could see yourself
It's that sound. The sound in your head. What if I could help?
The Toclafane. What are they? Who are they?

I am prepared.
I never sign anything before I've read it.
You promised complete control over the Time Lords.
But here in paragraph four sub
Well, I've heard that before. Almost got me killed once, but of course you know that.
Complete control.
Well, I've signed so many things, one more won't make any difference.
I'm honoured to be allowed to serve your glorious cause.
Shush.
Order K9 to tell you to shut up.
Amber alert. They've put an amber alert on me. On me? Cheek.
Yes, cheek.
Wrong.
Amber alert? On me?
Would you like a ball bearing?
Where's Leela?
What?
Fine time to take a bath.
Gentlemen, I'm delighted to be back on Gallifrey.
Oh, I like it. Yes, I like you. Where are you from, soldier?
Gallifrey? Never heard of it. Guard of honour? You're a rabble. Nothing but a rabble. You're not fit to guard a jelly baby. (to Andred) Would you like a jelly baby?
Well, let's get on with it. Come on, Leela. Where do you think you're going?
You stay here till I send for you.
Right, you lead.
Right.
What is it?
Well, I know it's the Chancellor's office.
Well, announce me.
I am here to claim my legal right.
I claim the inheritance of Rassilon. I claim the titles, honour, duty and obedience of all colleges. I claim the Presidency of the Council of Time Lords.
You don't dispute my claim, then?
Oh, Borusa, how you used to bore me with your interminable lectures on responsibility and duty.
Mmm.
You taught me nothing. Nothing that instinct couldn't provide better.
Mmm. And you yours, Lord Borusa.
I am the President! No persuasion is necessary.
I am the President! Is there another candidate legally?
Thank you.
Oh yes you did. Borusa, before you go, another lesson.
The Constitution.
Yes, and if I hadn't, you would have killed me.
Oh yes, Did you, did you just assume his Office?
Without a President, the Council can ratify nothing.
Yes. But my point is. Borusa! You haven't been give leave to depart yet.
The ceremony must take place at once.
At once!
It's always a matter of time, eh, Castellan? Especially for Time Lords. What do you think about my office?
Oh yes, yes, I know that. No, I meant my quarters. You know, room of ones own, somewhere to be. I do so hate squatting.
Correct. Have them refurbished.
Illegally.
Oh, yes, a Cardinal. That at least.
Yes, this has possibilities.
Oh, I don't know. Early Quasar Five with a touch of Rega.
Second dynasty, of course.
Well I did get used to it. I even liked it at times.
No, no, no. I prefer four three seven zero eleven nine.
Thank you.
Well that's something we've plenty of, eh, Cardinal? I mean, Chancellor-elect?
No. See to my friend, Leela. Make sure she has comfortable quarters and suitable clothes for my induction. She will attend.
No. We have things to discuss.
Oh, the redecorations, for one.
Oh yes. Quite. But I'd be so very grateful if you'd help him with the small things. The good Castellan has his flaws, hmm? I mean, his experience hardly extends to Earth zero seven three period.
Yes, you remember all those marvellous panels, hmm? Very primitive, of course.
Everywhere.
Everywhere. Floor, ceilings, wall, everywhere.
Shush.
It is.
Then more should. Put your best men on it immediately.
Borusa?
And the door. Everywhere.
What then?
Ah. Just the Matrix.
Yes, that's what I thought.
Yes. I didn't much care for it, either.
And when I've been introduced to the Matrix, will I have complete power?
I'll put it to good use. The best.
Oh, yes, quite, quite.
I swear.
I swear.
I swear.
Lord Chancellor, what happened?
What's she doing here?
Impossible. No aliens are allowed in here. Get rid of her.
Outside the Citadel, of course.
Yes, expel her.
That's funny, I've got a ringing in my head.
Shush. I've got a ringing in my head. Listen. Can you hear?
Yes.
So am I.
She can be dangerous, Castellan.
And switch that awful ringing off in my head!
That's better.
Playing at, Lord Chancellor?
I'd like a little more respect from you, if you don't mind.
Ah, that was before. I would have thought you, of all people, knew me better than that.
Believe me, Lord Borusa, I've never been more serious in any of my lives. While Leela remains free in the Citadel, we are in danger.
No! My ordeal at the induction has made me tired.
Can't fool me, Borusa.
Well done, Doctor.
Even the sonic screwdriver won't get me out of this one.
I have a problem. There is absolutely no point in having another door in the room if you don't have another key, hmm? QED. What? Latin. QED, Latin. Now, a key can either be lost or stolen, hmm? Therefore, ergo, you are the key, Borusa. Hmm? Palm print? No, that's too simple. Retina pattern? No. You must admit, you do like the sound of your own voice.
Open sesame. I command you to open. Please. Palm print, no. Retina pattern, no. Voice print? As Borusa always said, there's nothing more useless than a lock with a voiceprint.
There's nothing more useless than a lock with a voiceprint.
Bow to the Sash of Rassilon.
What do you think?
Really? What variables?
Like me?
How am I?
Oh, I see.
Good. Can we proceed then?
That bad, is it?
Listen, I've discovered the location of the security control room. It's directly beneath the Panopticon area, level three zero.
Well, that's not bad.
Suppose I throw a mirror cast?
Shadow shift. Create a false image to Space Traffic Control.
Shush. Suppose I reflect a transmission beam off the security shield, feed it back through a link crystal bank and boost it through the transducer?
I don't think you could. Ha!
What? You are the most insufferably arrogant, overbearing, patronising bean tin.
Nothing. Someone once said that to me, once.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Well at least no one's ever called me smug!
Listen. If you destroy the control centre after I feed in the Doppler effect and eliminate the red shift, the invasion must succeed, hmm?
Well, what's a couple of points between friends? Break the transduction field.
K9, destroy the transduction barriers.
Not yet. Can I have a few moments to get away, please?
And will you get off my foot, please?
Thank you.
That's all right. I've come back for my jelly babies. I'd left my jelly babies in the Tardis.
Jelly babies. Would you like one? They're a delicacy I discovered on Earth. Go on.
That's right.
What do you think?
Good, good. Here, have the bag.
No, no, no, go on. I've got plenty more. I've got plenty more. Anyone who likes jelly babies can't be all bad, huh? (sotto) Don't mention this to the Chancellor. He doesn't approve of jelly babies. I think he's frivolous.
Have you caught that girl yet?
There's no one in my capsule.
It is absolutely vital that girl is caught and put outside the Citadel. Absolutely vital.
Vital.
Hmm?
Good. Bring him in.
Mmm, thank you.
Castellan, how did that happen?
Castellan! You are responsible for security. You see to it.
Borusa! Call a meeting of the Council at once!
At once! No excuses! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Gentlemen, this is no ordinary meeting. I'm privileged to introduce to you your new masters.
Resistance is useless. The Vardans have more power than we have dreamed of and more knowledge than we can hope for. You must submit the way I did when I first met them.
A long time ago.
Yes, before that, yes.
And all I know is in the Matrix.
Did you really? Thank you.
You will now disperse until my next summons.
Borusa. Have you carried out my instructions?
The redecoration of my office.
Ah. (sotto) But is it finished?
Confirm it, and meet me there within the hour.
Thank you. You're very kind. That's very kind of you. (sotto, walking away) K9.
Nothing.
Yes?
Oh. Oh, it's just a matter of time.
Nice. Yes, really nice. Bit rococo for a purist like me. What are you doing here, Borusa?
Did I? Did I really? Oh yes, yes. Are the decorations complete?
Completely complete.
No substitutes, no forgeries, no penny-pinching.
And this exquisite relief work, in pure lead?
Good. Now at last we can talk.
Nearly. I owe you a great deal, Lord Borusa. Especially apologies for the indignities and insults I threw at you.
Thank you.
Need thank no one. True, very true. It's a habit I picked up.
Absolutely accurate, but not yet complete.
Yes.
Hmm, yes. They can read thoughts.
True.
Well, I had the benefit of your training.
Well, Lord Borusa, you and the other Time Lords are singularly logical, hmm? You're also short on humour and imagination. You can't offer distractions as I can. What's for tea?
Tea.
I know what tea is.
See, you're too single-minded. You're as transparent as good, old fashioned glass.
Because she could be the biggest danger of all.
Until she gets to outer Gallifrey.
Well, that barbarian garden's her natural habitat. She's a huntress, a creature of instinct. The power out there
Well, as much as I dare.
You'll be all right. Do you think you can do it?
You're a brave man, Borusa.
Yes. Yes, well, this shielding'll make them suspicious if we stay out of sight too long. Let's go.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
I wasn't talking to you. Move over. Shall we start? Chancellor, these are our new masters. I order you to acknowledge their absolute authority.
The Constitution is suspended as of now.
Yes, but it is so. Do it.
Don't destroy him. He might be useful to us.
Yes, of course. Yes, of course.
Get up, you stiff-necked old Chancellor. Get up. Castellan, have the Chancellor removed to his quarters.
And don't let anyone in or out. He's under house arrest.
You have to admire him. He has courage.
I've kept my part of the bargain. What more do you want?
And yourselves, I hope. I find it disconcerting talking to shimmering shapes.
Naturally, naturally. Well, Castellan, the Chancellor doesn't seem too keen to help. How about you?
I thought you would. You can start by making sure that no one organises any resistance. That's the last thing I want.
Good. Listen, why don't you regard yourself as Acting Vice-President?
And you'd better make me a list of all Time Lords holding official positions, and let me know which ones you think are reliable.
That's the stuff. Off you go.
I knew we could rely on him. Well, now that you're safely here, why don't you, er, make yourselves comfortable, hmm?
Yes. A jelly baby. My right hand pocket.
Orange.
One grows tired of jelly babies, Castellan.
One grows tired of almost everything, Castellan.
Except power.
Is the curfew effective?
What a splendidly subservient Citadel you do run, Castellan.
Have you brought the list?
So these Time Lords are the only potential rebels to our new regime, hmm?
You have?
Hmm. I should thing so, too. Well, if these are the only threats to our new regime, we'd better do something about them.
Oh, I hardly think so. They may be persuaded to see reason and some of them might be useful to us.
Oh, but there is.
Yes. Expulsion.
None of them can survive out there without help, and there's no help out there.
Naturally. Well, see to it, Castellan. Oh, and Castellan, if I were you, I'd put them out one by one.
Good.
Well, that's a good morning's work, wouldn't you say?
Isn't it time we shared a bit of trust? I mean, couldn't you materialise and have a jelly baby?
Oh.
Dismantle it? That's not possible.
But if we tamper with that, the whole planet could be vaporised.
I can't.
I'm not at liberty to say.
No, no, no. You stay here.
Rescinded.
Do you know what this is?
Will you disobey me?
Well, that's all right. I'll have him shot. You stay there.
How's it going, K9?
K9?
K9, this is no time to be enjoying yourself, all right?
Good. Take this. I could try it myself, but they'd be sure to find out.
Come on, K9. Come on. Easy, easy, easy. Steady now.
Good.
Excellent. Ah, Andred. I've got something for you. A surprise.
Oh, but.
Don't point that thing at me. I am the President, you know. You owe me a little respect. Stun him, K9.
Good dog. Well, don't just stand there, reconnect.
Come on, K9, come on.
Not now. Can't you see I'm busy?
It won't work in here. It's a patrol staser. It doesn't operate, you see, not in a relative dimensional stabiliser field.
A rather more effective treachery than yours, I hope.
I heard. K9? I'm going out for a few moments. I'll rely on you. And you, don't touch anything.
What's going on out here?
What? Did you have to kill them all?
I see.
But I assure you I do, I do. Someone's made an attempt on my life and you let the ringleader escape.
Yes, your own commander, Andred.
I hope not. You get after him before he tries again.
No way to go out there and leave. I've got news for you.
You're stuck here.
Your pitiful attempt at revolution has failed.
I'm the living proof I'm not. I don't know what they teach you at the Academy these days, but if you can't pull off a simple palace revolution, what can you pull off, hmm?
Yes. And it's going to stay jammed until the invaders have gone. (sotto) You see, while I'm in here, they can't touch me, and they can't read my thoughts.
Yes, and materialise at the end of it. But until they do materialise, I can't identify their planet of origin and time loop it.
Well, I do talk to myself sometimes, yes.
Oh. Oh, that old thing. Yeah. There's a problem there. I've been under a bit of a strain recently. You see, the Matrix has been invaded.
Yes.
Shush. Because they can read thoughts. Even encephalographic patterns. That's why I've plugged K9 into the Matrix instead of me. He's got no brains, you see. Sorry about that, K9.
This one I can. He's my second best friend.
Well, at least they don't suspect me.
Hmm. (eureka moment) It might just work. Give me your helmet.
That should keep them guessing.
Yes, I built a partial encephalographic barrier into it. It'll keep your deepest thoughts hidden, but you're going to have to concentrate. Can you do that?
Good.
Never mind.
K9.
What is it?
Can you tell where it's tuned to?
Why not, K9? Sorry. Go on, K9.
Is there now? That's interesting. Is it deliberate?
We're going to have to force them to materialise before we can identify their planet of origin.
K9? I'm going to have to play along with them again.
I'm going to dismantle the forcefield around Gallifrey.
It's the only way to convince them that we're really cooperating.
Yes.
I can't, but Rassilon can.
Yes.
That's right, but his mind lives on in the APC net. I'm part of that net now. Rassilon built the forcefield. Maybe he can dismantle it.
Exactly! Which is why it's the only way to convince them. How do you feel about that?
That's the spirit. K9, you're in charge.
I've been thinking about it very hard, but I need to contact
That's right.
There is a way.
Yes.
Well, it doesn't look too difficult. Well, don't stare at me. This is a very delicate operation. You're making me nervous.
Right, that seems to be in. Right? Right. Now hold your breath, or whatever it is you fellows hold. This is the tricky bit.
Hang on, Doctor, you're nearly there. What did you say? I said, hang on Doctor, you're nearly there.
Well, I did it.
There you are. I did it.
It's impossible to destroy the forcefield without atomising the entire planet, but I have made a sizeable hole in it above the Citadel.
Well, I'd need to do a little more work on it to achieve that.
Mmm. Disappointing, aren't they. Nice to see you again.
No, I can manage very nicely, thank you.
Would you like to assist me in my work? It's, er, it's this way.
Shush! I've had an idea. Two seconds.
Ah, there you are. I'm so glad you could make it. Base lead.
Take that.
And that.
And that. Come on, boy.
Shush, don't be frightened. Hand me the Sash. Trust me.
There we are.
Ready, K9?
Now don't get any ideas.
Open the door, Andred.
(sotto) Ready, K9?
Activate the modulation rejection pattern.
We've won again. I've sent the invaders back to their own planet. Course, I'll need the Matrix to jury-rig a time loop, but that's not
Well, it can't always be like the relief of Mafeking, you know.
Don't shout at me. Don't shout. Have you ever thought of taking it up seriously?
Well, killing people. A little practice, you'd become quite proficient.
Come on.
Castellan, is the Chancellor still in his office?
Good. Castellan, as Castellan you are responsible for security on Gallifrey in general and for my safety in particular, are you not, Castellan?
Castellan, I don't think you're very good at it. That's just my opinion, I'm only the President. Still, every oligarchy gets the Castellan it deserves, eh, Castellan?
Yes, well, never mind. Just clear up the mess when you've got a moment.
Yes.
It's been a long, hard road, but at last the future of Gallifrey is assured. What, what are you looking at?
Please don't fire that thing.
Sontaran troopers.
The SSSS. Isn't that carrying alliteration a little far?
No, I'm just Lord President of the Supreme Council of Time Lords on Gallifrey.
Well, that's no my fault. I'm Lord President, and I'm called sir.
Yes, sir.
That must mean many thousand sirs.
I was only trying to help.
I was only trying to help.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal, is it not, Commander Stor?
Victory over whom?
Victory over time?
I said, victory over time?
Stop!
Celebration chimes.
Yes, it should have been played at my induction, only fifty times lower. Someone's trying to help us.
We'd better split up. Leela and Andred come with me. The rest of you scatter. Come on.
A Sontaran.
A race devoted to perpetual war.
You don't know how.
Oh, yes.
Small vent at the back of the neck.
Oh, that was a prodigious throw!
Well, it was an amazing throw.
Well, yes, I know it's just an old hunting trick.
Come on.
I've got an urgent appointment.
Ah. This is a dangerous bit. Five, four, three, two, one, go.
Two, three, four, five, six?
We were delayed.
That's not going to hold forever, Chancellor.
I agree.
Your recipe?
Thanks for the thought. Thanks for the thought, Chancellor.
Well, dereliction of duty's pretty rife around here, Chancellor. Hadn't you noticed?
I'll vouch for them.
Oh, yes.
What? No. No, he's my friend.
He is a friend. You're my friend, aren't you, Borusa? You're the most important friend I've got.
Bringing up the heavy artillery, I imagine.
Evacuation?
I suggest my Tardis.
I think the exit through your office would be most expedient.
I know. There's something in there I want rather badly. Let's go. Come on.
Ah, Chancellor. You and I have things to discuss. Urgent things. Leela.
Take the others back to the Tardis.
Please.
That's right. Trust me, please.
Well, Chancellor? Are you going to help me or kill me, hmm?
Where is it?
Where is it?
I ask for the Great Key.
I have Rod of Rassilon and I have the Sash. I do not have the Great Key.
Chancellor, would you have me break my oath as President? My oath to seek the Great Key?
People are dying out there. Men, women, Time Lords even have died in that battle.
Isn't that important to you?
It leaves you unconcerned. That's the difference between you and me, Chancellor. I'm very concerned.
I'd rather care. Don't you care about your world being invaded by alien warmongers? These are Sontaran shock troops. A few still, but soon there'll be thousands, millions, threatening time itself.
Yes, Chancellor. Not while you have the Great Key.
If you wanted to hide a tree, where would you hide it? In a forest. I read your essay on reason.
Which one is it?
I'll take them all, if necessary.
No. Rassilon was a wily old bird. No president without the Great Key can have absolute power, correct? So to protect the Time Lords from dictatorship, he gave the Key into the hands of a Chancellor.
I know. I've been there. You haven't. There's no record in the Matrix of any president knowing the whereabouts of the Great Key. So who does? Not the Castellan, he's just a jumped up guard. But who guards the guards?
Yes. And I'll kill you before I let that Key fall into the hands of the Sontarans.
Ah, there you are. Got your new orders yet? Get in touch with Commander Stor. He'll put you in the picture.
The Great Key, you see. Good for years yet.
Is it? What? I don't understand.
They do?
Run?
Let's do that.
You're out of condition, Borusa, that's your problem. Do you think you can make it over there?
I didn't mean you, I meant the batteries.
Good.
Maybe I am getting too young for this sort of thing. Come on.
What do you do?
Good. You stand there. Andred, control booth seven, on the right. K9, go with him. Off you go.
Leela.
Show Borusa to the VIP suite.
The Chancellor's suite. It's down there on the left, up three stages, one down stage, turn left, turn left, turn left, turn left again. The room's marked no entry. Off you go.
Leela?
Take that for me.
I just have.
I do. Leela, that's important.
Good. Off you go.
What's your name?
Rodan. R O D A N. How do you do, Rodan?
Well, who could hope for more. What branch did you study?
Quasitronics. I don't know much about quasitronics.
Yes, I'm sure it is a simple field study exercise. You wouldn't have a glimmer of astrophysics, would you?
Good. Could you forget everything you ever learned?
I mean, could you switch my primary and secondary stabiliser circuitry into your secondary defence barrier?
Well, to close the hole I made in it, yes. Seal it up and stop any more Sontaran ships coming in.
You all right?
Good.
Crimps. Crimps. Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Five four two lever. Five four two lever.
Steady, old girl. This won't hurt a bit.
They could rampage right through the whole universe. And not just this universe, all the universes. Nasty thought, isn't it? That's why I had to stop them. Just had to.
Vinkelgruber? Are you listening to what I was saying?
Vinkelgruber.
I was saying that what they're after is the Rod of Rassilon, the Sash, and above all, the Great Key. These three together, linked into the Matrix, provide the sum total of Time Lord power. That's what they want.
Hand.
What is?
It's my Tardis you're talking about.
Yes. Why an entire battle fleet?
Huh, you haven't seen what a Sontaran battle fleet. Are you sure?
As long as the Tardis remains secure.
He's reversed the stabiliser banks.
A criminal Time Lord could, too.
We're being thrown into a black star!
Get Rodan.
Get Rodan.
Quick, lock the door.
Without that, no one can reset the systems. Where are the others?
The bathroom?
You got lost, didn't you.
Ah no, the mighty huntress got her. Don't you think she got lost?
I think you got lost.
Come on. You got lost.
You got lost!
All right, let's walk. I've got a wonderful sense of direction. I've got a perfect sense of direction.
Storeroom twenty three A.
The workshop.
Of course I have. Come on!
What nobody understands is, the advantage of my antiquated Tardis is that it's fully equipped and completely reliable.
Yes. Yeah, well, almost completely.
Service tunnel, Blue Section two five. Everything's going to be all right. You just follow me.
Odd. I could have sworn I've been here before.
Oh. Oh. I must be in level twenty three B.
Listen, I'm a Time Lord, not a painter and decorator. I'm preoccupied with (pause)
Yes. Sontarans, Daleks.
What did you say?
I'm not getting excited. I'm not getting
(sotto) What is it?
No, I'm not.
Would you get off my scarf, please.
Nonsense.
There you are.
Rodan, tell her she's wrong.
What?
Nonsense. I know this Tardis like the back of my hand.
Come on.
That clock's slow.
Come on, we can't sit around here all day.
I've just had one. Let's go and find K9.
No character.
Yes?
Nonsense. Rear area now, storeroom fourteen D. Onward!
Hello. boy. How's it going?
I know we're not going anywhere. I don't like the idea of inertia being perfect.
Is it clear?
Early warning. Something's broken in upstairs.
Leela, the key I gave you.
Can I have it, please? Thank you. Rodan, look at me. You are now in a state of deep hypnosis. Can you hear me?
Rodan, you will help K9. You will do whatever he tells you. When K9 asks you for this key, you will give it to him. You will not give the key to anyone else. You understand?
Good. Watch the door. Come on. We're relying on you, K9.
Sorry the lift's out of order. Shush.
I said I'm sorry the lift's out of order.
What? To the bathroom of course.
I've kept you waiting, Chancellor. I've kept you waiting, Chancellor.
Good.
I had nothing to do with this, I promise you. Chancellor, you know about the Rod of Rassilon.
And you know about the Sash of Rassilon.
And especially, you know about the Great Key.
Therefore, it would be very bad for us if you were to fall into the hands of the Sontarans. No breeding, you see.
Oh, but it is, it is, I assure you, Chancellor, it is. They're a cloned species, you see. They can multiply at the rate of a million every four minutes. Shall we go?
Good.
Pick a door, any door. Ready? Leave.
Come on.
What? Come on, pull yourself together, Borusa. Hello, sickbay. Quick, curtains. Lock the door, Andred.
What is it?
Leela?
Take these two back to the workshop. You know the way.
It's along there on the left. Second on the left, up two stages
Good. Bye, bye.
Come on, Doctor. You've got a perfect sense of direction.
Yes.
No. We've got to get to the workshop.
Yes, the workshop. Come on.
Finished?
Where is it?
Give me the key. Wake up, Rodan. Give me the key.
You know how helpless we are against the Sontarans.
It's the ultimate weapon. The Demat gun.
You built in under hypnosis. But how to arm it, hmm? Is that why the Key remained hidden for so long?
I could rule the universe with this, Chancellor.
No, wait, wait, Leela! Don't kill him! Kelner, where's Stor? Kill him.
The? Borusa, the Matrix.
Hold it, Stor.
You'll destroy us all.
But you'll destroy this entire galaxy.
And your battlefield.
Hello, Leela.
Put it away. Borusa, what are you doing here?
Excellence? Excellence?
Is this some kind of a joke, Borusa? It's not like you to make jokes.
My induction?
(sotto) Vardans.
(sotto) Sontarans.
I have? Oh. Well, what do you think of that, Leela?
Well, ta-ta, everybody. Come on, Leela. Come on. What's the matter?
What? Staying? Here? Why?
Ah, I see.
Yes, I'm sure you do hope. She'll look after you. She's terribly good with a knife. Come on, K9.
Here?
Why?
Yes?
I'll miss you too, savage.

You're welcome.
I'm always nice to you.
What? It's not. There's nothing to be suspicious about.
Yes. You can almost feel his hand painting it right in front of you, carving the colours into shapes. Wait a minute.
Well, just look at that.
Something very not good indeed.
Look there, in the window of the church.
Yes. And not a nice face at all. I know evil when I see it and I see it in that window.
Excuse me. If I can just interrupt for one second. Sorry, everyone. Routine inspection, Ministry of Art and Artiness. So, er
Yes, that's right. Do you know when that picture of the church was painted?
I'm going to have to hurry you. When was it?
As exactly as you can. Without a long speech, if poss. I'm in a hurry.
What year?
Thank you, sir. Very helpful indeed. Nice bow-tie. Bow-ties are cool.
Oh, thank you. Keep telling them stuff. We need to go.
Art can wait. This is life and death. We need to talk to Vincent Van Gogh.
Right, so, here's the plan. We find Vincent and he leads us straight to the church and our nasty friend.
Well, no. I suspect nothing will be easy with Mister Van Gogh. Now, he'll probably be in the local cafe. Sort of orangey light, chairs and tables outside.
That's the one.
Yeah, exactly like that.
Good evening. Does the name Vincent Van Gogh ring a bell?
Excuse me. Do you know Vincent Van Gogh?
Good painter, though, eh?
I'll pay, if you like.
Well, if you like, I'll pay for the drink. Or I'll pay for the painting and you can use the money to pay for the drink.
Oh, I'm new in town.
Yes.
She means yes. So, start again. Hello, I'm the Doctor.
Sorry?
Oh, no, not that kind of doctor. That's incredible, don't you think, Amy?
So. Er, Vincent, painted any churches recently? Any churchy plans? Are churches, chapels, religiousy stuff like that, something you'd like to get into? You know, fairly soon?
That is very good news.
That, on the other hand, isn't quite such good news. Come on, Amy, Vincent!
Please, let me look. I'm a doctor.
Oh no, no, no.
Okay, okay.
Are you all right?
Has anything like this murder happened here before?
As I thought. As I thought. Come on, we'd better get you home.
Oh, you're very kind.
Dark night. Very starry.
Until he paints that church.
Some clutter.
Not for me, actually.
You know, you should be careful with these. They're precious.
Right, so, this church, then. Near here, is it?
Oh, just casually interested in it, you know.
Okay, so, let's talk about you, then. What are you interested in?
You don't have to tell me.
Maybe you've had enough coffee now. How about some nice calming tea? Let's get you a cup of chamomile or something, shall we? Amy. Where's Amy?
No, no, no!
Amy? Amy? What happened?
It's okay. He's gone now and we're here.
Take it easy. Take it easy!
I don't know.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's not a bad idea. Amy, get back. He's having some kind of fit. I'll try to calm him down.
Easy, Vincent, easy. Look. Look, look, look. It's me, it's me, it's me. It's the Doctor, look. No-one else is here. So, Vincent
That is a good question. Let me help you.
Yes. Ish. Well, no. Not really.
No. No. Oi!
Oh, right. Yes. Of course.
Right. So he's invisible. What did he look like?
Oh, no, no. No, no!
It's just er, that was quite a good. Oh, no. On you go.
Okay. Okay. Right. Amy, make Mister Van Gogh comfortable. Don't let any invisible monsters in through the front door.
Well, don't worry. I'll risk it. What's the worst that can happen?
Oh right, yes, that. Don't worry. I'll be back before you can say where's he got to now? Not that fast! But pretty fast. See you around.
Right. You in here somewhere? I can't apologise enough. I thought you were just a useless gadget. I thought you were just an embarrassing present from a dull godmother with two heads and bad breath. Twice. How wrong can a man be?
Good. Okay, you're working. Now, see what you make of this. Who is that?
No, I know it's not that. There are thousands of them and you can see them plain as day.
No. Definitely not. This is the problem with the impressionists. Not accurate enough. This would never happen with Gainsborough or one of those proper painters. Sorry, Vincent. You will just have to draw something better.
That's better, old girl. Time delay, but you always get it right in the end. Good. Let's find out who this is, then. Well, well, there you are.
Maybe not that soon.
Take that, and that.
Never do that! You scared the living daylights out of me.
Wake, wakey, rise and shine! Breakfast is served in the courtyard. Whoa! What a morning. Come on. And Amy's got a little surprise for you.
And one I'm pretty sure you'll rise to. But, moving on, there's something I need to show you.
This is a creature called the Krafayis. They travel in space. They travel as a pack, scavenging across the universe. And sometimes one of them gets left behind. And because they are a brutal race, the others never come back. So, dotted all around the universe are individual, utterly merciless, utterly abandoned Krafayis. And what they do is, well, kill, until they're killed. Which they usually aren't. Because other creatures can't see them.
Yes. And that's why we are in a unique position today, my friend, to end this reign of terror. So, feeling like painting the church today?
Take my word for it. If you paint it, he will come.
In your own time. And I promise you, we'll be out of your hair by this time tomorrow.
This is risky.
Well, think about it. This is the middle of Vincent Van Gogh's greatest year of painting. If we're not careful, the net result of our pleasant little trip will be the brutal murder of the greatest artist who ever lived. Half the pictures on the wall of the Muse D'Orsay will disappear. And it will be our fault.
Vincent? Vincent! Vincent, can I help?
My experience is that there is, you know, surprisingly, always hope.
Come on. Come out. Come on, let's go outside.
Very well. I'll leave. I'll leave you.
We're leaving. Everyone knows he's a delicate man. Just months from now he'll, he'll take his own life.
Come on. We have to do this on our own. Go to the church at the right time and hope the monster still turns up.
Okay. Okay. So, now, we must have a plan. When the creature returns
Well, yes, tick. But last night we were lucky. Amy could have been killed. So this time, for a start, we have to make sure I can see him too.
The answer's in this box. I had an excellent, if smelly, godmother.
No. It's a thing. It's like a plan, but with more greatness.
And you'll be sure to tell me if you see any, you know, monsters.
No. Quite. And, to be honest, I'm not sure about mad either. It seems to me depression is a very complex
Well, yes. Paint. Do painting! I remember watching Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel. Wow! What a whinger. I kept saying to him, look, if you're scared of heights, you shouldn't have taken the job then.
And Picasso. What a ghastly old goat. I kept telling him, concentrate, Pablo. It's one eye, either side of the face.
Is this how time normally passes? Really slowly. In the right order. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's an unpunctual alien attack.
Yes, there's something not right and I can't quite put my finger on it.
Where?
As I thought. Come on. I'm going in.
No! You're Vincent Van Gogh. No.
I am.
Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I'm absolutely sorted. Just have to find the right crosactic setting and stun him with it. Sonic never fails. Anyway, Amy, only one thought, one simple instruction. Don't follow me under any circumstances.
Damn, he's moved.
Argh! I thought I told you. Never mind. We'll talk about it later. Quick, in here.
Absolutely quiet. Can you breath a little quieter, please?
Shush.
I think he heard us.
That is impressive hearing he's got. What's less impressive are our chances of survival.
Doing anything?
Where is he?
Anything?
Ooo.
This is no good at all. Run like crazy and regroup.
Right. Okay. Here's the plan. Amy, Rory.
Sorry. Er, Vincent.
I don't know, actually. My only definite plan is that in future I'm definitely just using this screwdriver for screwing in screws.
I suppose we could try talking to him.
Well, yes. Might be interesting to know his side of the story. Yes, though maybe he's not really in the mood for conversation right at this precise moment.
Well, no harm trying. Listen. Listen! I know you can understand me, even though I know you won't understand why you can understand me. I also know that no one's talked to you for a pretty long stretch, but please, listen. I also don't belong on this planet. I also am alone. If you trust me, I'm sure we can come to some kind of, you know, understanding. And then, and then, who knows?
What's it up to now?
What?
I am really stupid.
Oh, get a grip! This is not a moment to re-evaluate your self-esteem.
No, I am really stupid, and I'm growing old. Why does it attack but never eat its victims? And why was it abandoned by its pack and left here to die? And why is it feeling its way helplessly around the walls of the room? It can't see. It's blind. Yes, and that explains why it has such perfect hearing!
Vincent. Vincent, what's happening?
He's trying to say something.
I'm having trouble making it out, but I think he's saying, I'm afraid. I'm afraid. There, there. Shush, shush. It's okay, it's okay. You'll be fine. Shush.
Sometimes winning, winning is no fun at all.
I've seen many things, my friend. But you're right. Nothing quite as wonderful as the things you see.
Oh, no, no, no. I could never accept such an extraordinary gift.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Well, no, you're not thinking exactly what I'm thinking. Vincent! I've got something I'd like to show you. Maybe just tidy yourself up a bit first.
Now, you know we've had quite a few chats about the possibility there might be more to life than normal people imagine?
Well, brace yourself, Vinny.
Oh, a huge variety of things. This one here, for instance, plays soothing music. While this one makes a huge amount of noise. And this one makes everything go absolutely tonto.
That's a friction contrafibulator!
That's ketchup. And that one's mustard.
Good idea. Although, actually, there's a little something I'd like to show you first.
Paris, 2010 AD. And this is the mighty Muse D'Orsay, home to many of the greatest paintings in history.
Ignore that. I've got something more important to show you.
Doctor Black, we met a few days ago. I asked you about the church at Auvers.
Yes. And today is another cracker if I may say so. But I just wondered, between you and me, in a hundred words, where do you think Van Gogh rates in the history of art?
Vincent. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is it too much?
It's been a great adventure and a great honour.
I'm delighted. I won't ever forget you.
I'm not sure there will.
I wouldn't say that. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. Hey. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant. And we definitely added to his pile of good things. And, if you look carefully, maybe we did indeed make a couple of little changes.
No Krafayis.
The ultimate ginger.

It's the end. But the moment has been prepared for.
I. Oh.
Ah. You've come to help me find the Zero Room. Welcome aboard. I'm the Doctor. Or will be if this regeneration works out.
Now, ordinary spaces, of course, show up on the architectural configuration indicators, but any good Zero Room is balanced to zero energy with respect to the world outside its four walls. Or however many walls it has.
There was a very good polygonal Zero Room under the Junior Senate block on Gallifrey, widely acclaimed for it's healing properties. Romana's always telling me I need a holiday.
Gone? Really? Did she leave a note?
Well, if we did, we did.
This should get you back to the console room when the time comes.
There are strong dimensioning forces this deep in the Tardis. Tend to make one a bit giddy.
I don't know. I can feel it isn't going to be as smooth as on other occasions. Sooner we get to this Zero Room place, the better, eh?
I left a waistcoat like that on. Ever been to Alzarius?
Really? It's a small universe, isn't it.
I wonder, boy, what would you do if you were me, hmmm? Or perhaps I should ask, what would I do if I were me.
Not far now, Brigadier, if the Ice Warriors don't get there first. Oh no. Oh dear. We've wandered into the wrong corridor. We must be close to the main Tardis drive now. Jamie. Jamie, you go back.
No, nonsense, be sensible, go back! When I say run, run! Don't you understand? The regeneration is failing.
Adric! Adric, not that way! Adric. I remembered his name.
Adric!
That's the trouble with regeneration. You never quite know what you're going to get.
No.
Ah! Dear me. Needs a drop of linseed oil though.
Well, I suppose I'll get used to it in time.
That's it. That's the door!
The Zero Room door, I heard it slam.
Fit as a fiddle, Vicki, but something very peculiar is going on in the Tardis. The Zero Room. Have you seen it anywhere?
Good. I'll follow you.
Hello, carmine seepage.
Oh that's a relief, I thought the Tardis auto-systems were playing up again. Dreadful. Always going wrong. It's time we went to Logopolis to get it all sorted out once and for all.
Zero Room? Oh, it's very big, empty, sort of grey. Pinkish-grey.
Thank you. You must be Tegan. Works even better if you close the doors, Nyssa.
Yes. I've never quite understood why. It's quite peaceful, isn't it.
Oh, just until my dendrites heal. (taps his head) The nervous system's a very delicate network of logic junctions.
Oh, yes, I was forgetting, Nyssa, bioelectronics is your strong point. Yes, well, my tussle with the Master came at precisely the wrong moment. When the synapses are weak they're like radio receivers, picking up all sorts of jumbled signals.
Completely! Even the gravity's only local. Goodness me, I'm tired.
Bed? Oh, I don't need a bed. Not in the Zero Room.
One of the advantages of stark simplicity.
Oh, you don't do it. It just sort of comes to you, like sleep. Very like sleep. We only just made it to the Zero Room in time.
This regeneration is going to be difficult, and I shall need you all, every one of you. You, Tegan, you have it in you to be a fine coordinator, keeping us all together during the healing time. Nyssa, of course, has the technical skill and understanding. All the information you need is in the Tardis databank. I'm sure you can find your way to it.
Good, good. Of course you have. And Adric, Adric with his badge for mathematical excellence. Adric is the navigator. He knows the way. He knows me, my old self. Adric, you must help me heal the disconnection. Your role is very crucial.
What's the matter?
There seems to be something distinctly wrong. I can feel it.
Shush. The Tardis Cloister Bell. Imminent disaster.
Oh, worse than that. The Tardis is in danger. Who's in the console room?
And Adric.
Well, is he, or isn't he?
Adric isn't what? Tell me!
I've got to do something.
Tablets. The mixture. The ointment.
The potion. The solution. Oh, my little friend, if only you were.
Oh, transport of delight.
Go softly on!
Smoke! Heat! And noise! Adrenaline! And neuropeptides! The brain's working!
The manual override, Nyssa. I'll have to explain how to vent the thermo-buffer. Listen very carefully. My concentration may go again at any moment.
This will be simpler, of course, if you go into hover mode first, always remembering of course not to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. The whole system is on manual now. This is where it starts to get really dangerous.
The temperature will start coming down fairly quickly, but without that stimulus my neuropeptide level will fall to normal.
Good, good. Now, as soon as full console functions are restored, you can start to reprogram the architectural configuration. I'd better show you.
Er.
Oh, the architectural configuration system can do more than that. We can actually delete rooms.
Yes, exactly. Zap! Enough zap and you have your thrust. Now, follow this very carefully.
Now, have you got that?
Mass in motion. Thrust, if you like. Time for lessons later.
Yes, well, don't worry, it works. We had to do that once with Adric to get away from. By the way, where is Adric?
Well, where? We need him!
Well?
Well, tell me later. There's not much time. Once the star field reaches critical mass, we'll be shut into the in-rush. Where were we, Jo? Deleting rooms.
Shush. Come on, we've got to finish this. Seventeen thousand tons of thrust. Say twenty five percent of the architecture.
Doesn't matter, same thrust.
Yes?
Oh, yes. That's the trouble with manual override.
Get K9 to explain it to you. Good luck.
Castrovalva.
How do we get there?
Are you sure?
When the Tardis is on manual, you can't be certain of anything.
It's harder to fly than you think. I mean, you don't just flick a switch.
So, this air hostess person's flying it, eh? Well I wish her the best of luck.
I don't think so.
What? I don't know.
Can't be.
Jettisoned.
Handy little device, the sonic screwdriver. Got me out of a lot of scrapes.
Unscrew the hinges! If you wouldn't mind.
Well done, Nyssa. That's the idea. We make another Zero Room out of what's left.
And unlike the Tardis, it is very small.
Oh, just the Zero Cabinet.
You won't feel my weight. I'll make it easy for you. I'll be levitating.
So sorry. Lost concentration for a moment. Very tired.
Please, there's not much time. Thank you.
Hmm. Twelve of them at least. War party, maybe.
Doctor? Everyone's looking for him.
That's the strangest thing of all. I'm not entirely sure.
Librarian? Books and stuff?
Then you read? You all read?
Castrovalva? Yes, the place to rest.
Definitely civilisation.
The hunt. Yes, it's all coming back to me. You weren't at the hunt.
I suppose that's why they made you librarian.
Reaching down the books from the top shelf.
You're a doctor?
Not the Doctor, I suppose? I came here to find him, I think.
The Portreeve? A sort of magistrate?
Yes, good night.
You're the Portreeve.
Yes, that is good.
You overheard?
Oh?
Yes, it has been a long journey. Tell me Portreeve, off the record, will I find the Doctor here?
Good.
Good night.
Doctor? Doctor.
Nyssa. Lovely morning. I'm beginning to feel quite my old self. Or rather my new self.
I like your Castrovalva, Portreeve. Very clever of them to have brought me here.
Oh, the Ogrons and the Daleks and that. No, no, I think it does us good to be reminded the universe isn't entirely peopled with nasty creatures out for themselves.
Whoever did this certainly has a way with needle and thread.
This device you mentioned
Fascinating demonstration, Portreeve. How often do the pictures renew themselves?
Some form of fast particle projection, I suppose.
Indeed.
You know, I had no idea I was putting them to so much trouble. It's a very long way for three young people to carry me.
Yes. Er, Tegan, Nyssa and, er, Tegan. No, that's silly. Er, Nyssa, Tegan and Nyssa. Nyssa, Tegan. You know, I'm sure there's someone missing.
One, two. Good day. One, two. No, no, no, no.
One, two.
What?
Do you know, that's exactly what I thought.
Stop, please. You're making me dizzy. We'll have to give you a badge for mathematical excellence. (lightbulb moment) Adric. Adric!
No time for that. Where is he?
Adric!
Adric told you?
Please, never mind about the apologies. I think it's time I heard all about this.
The Tardis.
We can't go through all that again.
Well, we'll just have to hope, won't we?
Which is the quickest way out of here?
Yes, well that's democracy for you. Come on.
Never mind, come on. (And downwards.)
I always did have a terrible sense of direction. Still as long we keep going down.
Sorry. No time. Must dash. Come back later. Where does this lead?
Thank you.
Shush. Concentrate. This could be serious.
Very like it. Quick. There may still be time to reverse the sense!
Castrovalva, folding in on itself deliberately.
Recursive occlusion. Someone's manipulating Castrovalva. We're caught in a space-time trap!
I'm perfectly all right. We have got to find out what's causing the occlusion. Follow me!
Please find the Zero Cabinet.
Be careful. If I'm right, the occlusion won't be dangerous to you at this moment. You're only trouble will be finding the way. Quickly!
Must be about five hundred years old.
Now that's odd. That's very odd indeed.
Mergrave. Just the chap. There's something you can do for me.
Well done, Margrave.
You know, I'm very fond of history, but I don't usually get much time for reading.
No! Please. It's backed with silver. Helps to keep it out.
Precisely what I'm trying to find out. Tell me, Mergrave, what do you see out of the window?
And it all makes sense to you?
Shardovan.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
A perfect example of recursion, Mergrave. And recursion is exactly what we're up against. Draw me a square, large as you can.
Good. Now, in the square, a rough map of Castrovalva.
Now, the library, the square, the Portreeve's house. Now, where's your pharmacy?
Four pharmacies in a small place like this?
You positioned it four times.
Hmm.
Valeriana officinalis centiculare europea. And just a hint of rosemary.
Not as well as you. But I'm afraid one of us is deluded about geography.
Yes, yes, come in.
Well, that's Castrovalva, not Ruther. I suppose you know the whereabouts of the Portreeve's house.
Well put. Show us on the map.
There is something amiss with Castrovalva, but because your perception is part of it, you cannot see it.
Yes, well, I'm afraid that would take some doing.
Yes, yes, in a minute. This library of Shardovan's, are all the books like this?
These volumes chronicle the rise of Castrovalva out of an alliance of warring hunters twelve hundred years ago. Or purport to chronicle.
Yes, well, I'm no expert, but I have the strongest possible hunch that these are forgeries.
Oh, the threads, the bindings, the paper, are as near the real thing as may be, but the contents are faked.
There is something we're all overlooking.
I don't know. I'm overlooking it, too.
But I'm certain the whole history's been invented.
If there ever was a real history.
Shardovan. I thought as much. I must see the Portreeve.
One little suggestion.
You're the man I want.
You're the only man here who could not be persuaded to join the hunting ritual.
Your intelligence would not permit it. You suspected the whole tradition was invention from beginning to end and here's the proof. Your annotations of the histories.
Hmm. The fiction of Castrovalva. A civilisation evolving out of tribal warfare into an ideal community. It is a fiction, and the thing that confirms it
Oh, I know it. It's on the tip. It's on the tip of my mind. The books are five hundred years old at least, but
Don't tell me you're lost, too?
But you do see it? The spatial anomaly.
We must be very close to whatever he's using to power all this. Come on, we'll have to hurry. You're a good tall chap.
Shush!
Listen carefully. This man you know as Portreeve is the most evil force in the universe. You have got to help me defeat him. Got to, do you understand?
Well, say something, please!
Yes would be best.
Are you sure of that, Master?
I know, I know. Stay back.
So that's how you're sustaining Castrovalva.
Deadly, you mean.
All right, Master. It's me you want. Let the boy go.
There was no call for that.
Unless you let every one of them go now
Shardovan, get back!
He gave his life to help us.
So must we. Without the web to support it, the local space will fold up into itself. Come on!
It still makes sense to Mergrave. Stay behind him.
The square again.
It couldn't take off. Space is squeezing in too fast.
It can't collapse without causing a breach somewhere.
Adric created it. Which way?
Anything you don't recognise as Castrovalva.
Follow Adric. Hold on to each other.
Mergrave.
Mergrave, we have got to leave.
Let's hope so.
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. All right, rest. Deep breaths. Well done, Adric.
Got to be fit to crew the Tardis. Trim Time Ship and a ship-shape team.
Who landed this?
You flew the Tardis?
There aren't any.
It was a projection.
Adric pre-programmed it. Whatever you did to the console, we'd have ended up at Castrovalva.
The Master leaves nothing to chance.
Adric?
Oh, I think so. In fact, I feel quite like my old self. Well.
Well, whoever I feel like, it's absolutely splendid.

Don't whistle, dear, please.
Stop whistling!
(mumble) Buzz off, now.
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Deafen you? No, no, dear boy. It was an unfortunate juxtaposition of the sonic rectifier with the lineal amplifier.
I've already told you, my dear. It's a Time and Space Visualiser.
It converts neutrons of light energy into electrical impulses.
Do I detect a hint of sarcasm, dear boy?
Very well then, I shall quote you Ven Der Haff's law. Mass is absorbed by light, therefore light has mass and energy.
Splendid child, splendid.
I couldn't have put it better myself, child.
Yes, that's exactly what this is.
I have already fixed it, my dear. My dear Chesterton, do you mind if I distract you from your cowboys and indians?
I want to give a little demonstration. Will you think of an event in history?
Well, first the place.
Now the geographical location, date and time.
Good! Don't go away.
Watch.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, now, all in good time, my dear, all in good time. Now, Barbara.
Put it in there. In the slot. Now.
Shh!
Come along, come.
Now you've squashed my favourite Beatles!
I think you'd better turn it off, my dear. Yes, we're about to materialise.
Well, everything appears to be all right. Yes. The oxygen's high and the gravity is a little greater than Earth.
Well, it's no small wonder. Look up there, my dear. Look. Two suns moving very quickly. I expect the days and nights are very short here.
The child's just like me, you know. Always wants to know what's on t'other side of the hill.
No, no, no, no, Chesterton, here, here.
Look here, you'd better take this Tardis magnet with you. Watch that little green light in there. Don't drop it, otherwise you'll get lost.
Yes, yes, yes.
I beg your pardon? awful noise? That's no way to talk about my singing!
Oh, yes, yes, it sounds like the Visualiser. I think it's still on. Yes, would you mind going in and switching it off for me, dear?
Yes, thank you.
Oh, awful noise, indeed. Ha! I can charm the nightingales out of the trees.
Yes, all right, my dear, all right, all right. What is it now? Gracious me, can't I even relax for five
The Daleks!
What is more important, he referred to the Tardis as the enemy time machine.
My machine can only pick up the things that happened in the past.
Or worse, already here. You heard their orders. We are to be exterminated!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but Ian and the child. Come on, we have such little time.
The wretched wind has wiped out all their tracks. It's so cold here.
Ah, this way, dear.
I have the directional instincts of a homing pigeon. Now, come along. Follow me.
It's probably got buried in that sandstorm.
Yes, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. I've got an idea. Let's have a look at the Tardis magnet. Oh, I'm sorry, I just remembered I gave it to Ian. Well, come on, come on. We can't waste time. Let's get going. That sun'll be up in a minute and we've no food and there's no water, no shade. Get down! Get down!
Keep your head down. They haven't seen us yet.
Stay down. One of them's coming this way. (they duck down) We must find the Tardis before they do.
Yes. Warn them? But how? We haven't seen them for hours. Anyway, it's no good hanging about here. Come on, let's get moving, come on.
These Mire Beasts, what do they feed on?
You mean they attack humans?
Oh, good gracious.
Oh, I don't think they can travel far in this sand.
Exploded?
Now, hush, hush, hush.
I'm afraid I can't see any signs of a city.
I see. Well, we're very grateful for your hospitality but I must you the Daleks are right on top of us. And I don't want either you or your people involved in any of this dangerous business. If they knew you'd given us shelter, they'll show no mercy.
Ah, splendid, splendid.
Barbara! Barbara, my dear, Come along, come along, come along.
Mmm. I think this is absolutely delicious. It's a most unusual flavour, isn't it?
Oh, my dear, you think I'm being callous do you?
And I think it's pure supposition that they've been caught by those Mire Beasts. After all, we weren't. You haven't much faith in Ian's infallible self-preservation, have you?
Oh rubbish, my dear, rubbish. I think it's fascinating. Yes, you could almost call it beautiful. You know, I think you're tired. Close your eyes and try and get some rest. Go on, go on. We must conserve our strength if we're going to get back to the Tardis. (to himself) Yes, if ever we can get back to the Tardis. Ah, Malsan.
Oh, indeed. Yes, indeed, yes. Yes, it was a most unusual taste. You know, I've been taking stock of this place, having a jolly good look round here. Tell me, why is this opening walled up?
Yes.
Now, what is it?
Yes, I suspected something of that kind might happen. What is it?
They mean what they say. They don't make idle threats. Have you replied?
You haven't much choice, have you? Well, I don't propose to inflict our troubles on you, sir, so I think we'll leave and take our chances.
Do you mean?
Are you feeling better?
Well, it's not too good, I'm afraid. Ah, this looks like bad news coming now.
Well?
What is the news, hmm?
They have no choice.
Two hours. Their suns are due to set in two hours.
Hmm?
Oh, it's another part of the city, I believe. The part that was invaded.
Is Ian, is Chesterton all right?
Ah, well, well, well now! That puts a different complexion on the matter. Tell me, my dear, this tunnel, would you know how to find it again?
Yes, now I can
Barbara! Barbara!
Chesterton, come here!
My dear boy!
Quickly, quickly!
Come along.
My dear boy, we're trying to beat the Daleks, not start a jumble sale.
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
What is the point of all this, dear boy?
That's a good scheme. Yes, that's a good idea.
Mmm.
Well, I hope it works.
All right. Careful.
Yoo-hoo, Auntie!
Hey!
Go on!
Yes, young lady, a very good thing we did. We might not you know.
A momentary qualm, a momentary qualm. Nothing more, nothing more.
Yes, quite so.
Oh, I don't know. I should think a little Pate de Dalek a la Mire Beast might be rather palatable.
Well, we can always drop you off to find out.
Ah and I don't think we shall run into them again. And I think you must agree that we gave them a very good hiding. Yes, yes, yes.
That's my Time Path Detector. It's been in the ship ever since I constructed it. But do you know, I don't remember it registering before?
Well, it surveys the time path we're travelling on. The fact that it's registering can only mean one thing.
It's another time machine travelling on the same route.
Oh, it's useless, useless.
Ah, I'm afraid it's no good. I'm quite unable to elude them.
It takes twelve minutes for our computers to re-orientate and gather power. Now, that twelve minutes is vital to us. We must hold onto it. Give me time to be able to do something whereby
Yes, well, please, just leave it to me, dear boy, just leave it to me, will you?
Oh, that means we can land in two minutes.
Oh, just the four of us, young man.
Yes, quite so, quite so, dear boy. Well, the computers will be ready in a few moments. I suggest that we re-embark.
Vicki, Barbara, come along.
No, it ain't! I mean, it isn't.
Secret?
Chase? Yes, as a matter of fact, young man, that's exactly what this is. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be getting along. It's the chase, you know?
Yes, I wonder.
Catching us up, are they? Will you get my screwdriver, child? The large one. The one that I was fiddling with on the Visualiser.
Yes, thank you, thank you.
Maybe, I'm not sure. But if they're going to catch us up, we've got to find something to fight back with.
That's out of the question, my dear. The vacuum in space, we should all be dead in no time.
Ah, thank you, thank you.
Well, the idea is, my dear, is to find something that we can fight back with.
But I'm not ready! I'm not ready! We can't meet them now! Oh, good gracious! No, wait a minute. We shall have to land and then take off as quickly as we can again.
Well, everything appears to be in order, my boy.
Indeed, indeed. Well, we're ready to move on. Now, would you tell the ladies that I want to get away, please.
Thank you.
Ah, I'm sorry about that too.
I altered the curve we were travelling on. For one moment, I dared hoped we'd lost them. They must have detected the change and followed. They're close on our track.
I'm afraid not. It's down to eight. It will be reduced even further after our next landing. We must face the facts. The Daleks are closing in on us.
Oh, rubbish my child. Vampire bats are only to be found in South America.
No, I don't think so. Judging by the architecture, I should say Central Europe.
Yes, in the normal progress of time, my dear, I would say, I would agree with you, but unfortunately we've got to face the Daleks and I think it's essential we take a look around. Let's try upstairs.
Oh, very well, stay where you are. We shan't be long.
Oh, it's just thunder, dear boy.
Oh, rubbish, there was no noise before that. Come along, come along.
Well, it looks like a laboratory to me. Look at all that equipment down there.
Oh, nonsense. We've only just left them, dear boy. Now, I must see what's on that table.
You don't mean that, do you? Where's your spirit of adventure?
Very well, then, stay where you are. Stay where you are.
I say, I think we'd better check where Vicki and Barbara is!
Yes, that's the word, dear boy, familiar. You know, when I was coming down those stairs, I knew that thing was going to move. I knew it.
I never stay where I'm not wanted. Come along.
Pre-conditioned. That's it. Pre-conditioned!
This house is exactly what you would expect in a nightmare. Yes, we're in a world of dreams. Creaking doors, thunder and lightning, monsters and all the things that go bumpety bumpety in the night.
Yes, yes it exists in the dark recesses of the human minds. Millions of people secretly believing. Think of the immense power of all these people, combined together, makes this place become a reality.
Safe? What on earth do you mean, dear boy?
You know, I believe you're right. Yes! The Daleks can never land here!
Vicki? Barb? Perhaps they followed us upstairs?
Had we?
Well, after you, dear boy.
Shh! Someone's coming.
The Tardis, quick!
Where have you both been?
Game?
Theory, my dear boy? Fact. I am convinced that that house was neither time nor space. We were lodged for a period in an area of human thought.
Oh, I don't want to enter into it. A discussion with him! Oh!
Oh, necessarily crude, dear boy. I haven't time to perfect anything.
You know just as much about that as I do.
Oh, I quite agree with you. Running away won't solve our problem. But as soon as we've reached the final decision to stand and fight, there'll be no turning back. It'll either be them or us. Hmm?
Oh, my dear, very welcome.
Thank you.
But I thought she was with you?
It's my fault. All my own stupid fault. I shouldn't have moved the Tardis. I have should have checked up first to make sure that everybody was inside. I shall never forgive myself.
You don't think I'd be standing here doing nothing do you, if there were? We're helpless, and you of all people should know that the Tardis can't land in the same time and place twice!
Yes, of course, it's possible, but it might take months, even years.
Yes, my dear, I know it's worth a try but you don't think the Daleks are going to sit back and allow us to tinker do you? They're right on our tracks. Their one aim is to destroy.
Do you mean capture their machine?
If we can only pull it off.
I say yes. Yes, yes! Our next landing will be our battle ground and we shall fight. We shall fight to the death!
Yes, all to the good, my boy. This sort of terrain is going to make it very difficult for the Daleks.
Yes, you are perfectly correct, perfectly correct. However, it doesn't matter about the appearances. It's quite safe to go outside.
Alive! Yes.
Well, I'm not sure, young lady. Is it a plant or some kind of fungus?
Yes, I think this is the moment when discretion is the better part of valour. Let's get back into the ship.
How did that get there?
Well, our friends here obviously don't like the light.
Well, it does suggest that there are other creatures on this planet. Yes, creatures of intelligence.
Yes!
Yes, its a kind of pattern. Yes, you're quite right, my boy, a corridor.
Yes. Yes, well let's follow it. This way.
Come along, come along.
We seem to have come to the end of our corridor of lights.
Any Daleks?
Let's take a closer look.
Well, I'm not quite sure, dear boy, but there must be a reason for it. Yes, like everything else in the universe, there is a reason for it.
Oh, do be careful what you're doing with that.
Well, I should imagine it's some kind of weapon. Just hold that a minute.
Ah, cha, cha, cha, not so close! (He presses something on the thicker end and the thin end lights up)
Well, that's ingenious, isn't it?
Very good, my dear, very good.
Just, just, just, shh, shh, shh. Just a moment now. May I speak? There's something I haven't told you, dear boy. We cannot use this machine in an enclosed area, otherwise we shall all go up in smoke.
That may be
Now you're talking common sense. Yes, let's find the cable, shall we?
You're quite safe, it's well insulated.
Watch the machine. Watch the machine.
You know Chesterton, they have an extraordinary range of movement, extraordinary.
Take a look outside, my boy. I'll look after Vicki.
Oh, come along child, you're all right. Come along. Come along, my dear. Come along.
My dear girl. What on earth is wrong with you?
Robot? My dear, you have haven't got a temperature, have you?
A robot exactly like me?
So that's it! This is very serious, Chesterton. Barbara would never have left here unless, unless you or I told her to go.
You all right, child? Come along!
Robot? Robot? Me? You're the imposter. He is the imposter!
I don't have to.
Why, you!
Get out of my way.
I shall give you the same treatment.
Oh, what does it matter what I say now.
(Dalek tones) Stop! Do not kill!
Hmm, I must get a Doctor.
No, they're not very encouraging, dear boy.
Yes, but I don't mind admitting, I feel rather exhausted after all that experience.
Yes, I don't suppose we can do much in this light.
Yes, well, we'll give it a few hours. It might get lighter. I think I'll take your advice. But I shan't sleep.
Chesterton!
Get up, get up, get up!
Look here!
I say, you two in there! Come along, wake up, wake up! Come out here quickly!
Quite so. And that is where we've got to get to.
Have you got that thingummybob?
Come along, come along, let's go. Come on.
Well, we must clear this cave as soon as possible, otherwise we can't work that device.
I have infiltrated and killed. We may now return to Skaro.
They know now who's who. Give me that machine. All of you, get against the wall. I'm going to see what I can do with this.
Yes, you got us out of a nasty situation there. I supposed you'd like to know who we are and why we're here?
If's fantastic!
Yes, well I don't like it.
Yes, yes, robot's. But haven't you noticed something very singular about this place?
We've only seen robots. No animal life, human or otherwise.?
Well, we've learned something. His name.
Well, I'm glad to know you, Steven Taylor.
Yes, well, you haven't. How long have you been here?
You mean there's no other human beings here on this planet?
No, no, no, no, they're programmed to do their own repairs.
Yes, I see. We're being held here as specimens.
We make our way back to my spaceship.
I certainly hope so.
Yes, I'm coming, dear boy, I'm coming. Oh, tell me, young man. What happens if these Mechanoids see us up there?
Good, good!
Splendid.
Yes, wait a minute, dear boy.
Chesterton, be careful!
Oh, it's some power aerial, I suppose.
Yes, yes, if we can break it.
Yes, come along, come along!
Yes, it sounds rather risky.
Go on, go on.
Go on! Now, I think we'll leave them something to remember us by.
Never mind about that. Let's get on with this. Come along. Quickly! Get that. Come on.
Vicki, my dear, I'm going to blindfold you. You won't be able to see a thing. You'll be quite safe. Now come along.
Now come along, child. Pull your self together
Vicki, come along, come along!
Come along
Good gracious! The place is on fire!
No, Steven!
Come back!
Vicki, my child, are you all right?
Come along, let's get back to the Tardis.
We don't know, my child, and his chances of survival in this furnace are utterly
My dear boy, I could kiss you!
Oh, I'd be delighted! You know, this must be an extremely advanced machine. Wherever we went, it followed us with such great precision and accuracy. You could travel anywhere in it.
Of course, my dear, I'd forgotten. You've taken a trip in it.
My dear, I shall be delighted.
I don't want to know! I want none of this! I've never heard such nonsense in my life! You'll end up as a couple of burnt cinders, flying around in space. You idiots! You are absolute idiots!
Aimless? I've tried for two years to get you both home!
How dare you, young man. How dare you, sir! I didn't even invite you into the ship in the first place. You both thrust yourselves upon me!
Oh, for heavens sake, I've never heard such nonsense.
No! No! I will not aid and abet suicide.
Don't you want to go with them, child?
Don't you realise, child, the enormous risks?
Do you both realise the enormous risks?
Very well, follow me. But you must follow my instructions implicitly, understood? Implicitly! You will both have about a fifty-fifty chance. Follow me, come along.
I shall miss them. Yes, I shall miss them, silly old fusspots. Come along, my dear, it's time we were off.

Stop. Stop. Concentrate on one thing. One thing.
It's over. (chuckles) It's over.
The muscles are still a bit tight.
Hold that.
Tilt it.
Put it down. Put it down.
Ah! The Crusades, from Saladin. The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he?
Oh, I don't look like him.
Don't you know?
Extermination.
Ah. Very good. Nails need growing.
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.
Life depends on change and renewal.
I've been renewed, have I? That's it. I've been renewed. It's part of the Tardis. Without it, I couldn't survive. Come here.
Come here.
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?
I thought so. I wonder where. I wonder where.
I think. I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.
(still reading the diary) Oxygen density 172, radiation nil, temperature 86. Strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?
Are you coming, you two?
Time I put you through some tests, I think.
Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan.
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?
I am the Examiner.
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once.
Your turn now, Governor.
Please go on.
Interesting. Continue.
I shall examine the capsule later. You may leave us.
We are wearing proper clothes.
Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it. Terrible manners. To tell you the truth, I was studying his reaction, seeing if he agreed with the story.
Must have a look at that capsule.
Our answers must come from that mercury swamp.
When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule.
Where did you get this?
Dropped?
Extermination.
A laser. Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it.
I think we'll leave if for tonight.
That is my decision, Governor.
A hundred years you say this has been buried?
It didn't come from this planet Vulcan.
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.
The Daleks.
These two pieces of metal are identical. The Doctor got one of them from the Daleks himself.
I knew I should find them here. I knew it.
Nothing human, no.
There were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?
A light. A torch, outside.
Quickly, Ben, quickly!
No. No, there's nothing.
Ah ha. Excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.
Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.
This light is dead. Now the watch.
Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position. What does that suggest to you? Don't know. Haven't thought about it. But all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek.
Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.
Real Doctor? Oh, you mean the real Doctor.
Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Lesterson listen. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen.
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...
Listen, listen.
Read this. Aloud!
Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does it? Unless it's in micro-print.
What was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside that capsule?
You were astounded?
Amazed?
You didn't even give them a glance! Why? Because you'd been in there and seen them. Where is the third Dalek?
You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks. You took one of them away and you hid it!
These lumps of metal, Daleks, I want them broken up, or melted down. Up or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!
I'm an Earth Examiner. I demand it.
Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately.
But not impossible. Ben, Polly.
Which is why I have a badge which says so.
If there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five minutes, would you ask my permission before you ripped up the floorboards? Ah ha, fruit!
Nuts? Yes, certainly, here we are. Crackers?
China. Yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo.
Yes, Marco Polo, a friend. I believe he was.
Shh!
I never talk nonsense.
Well, hardly never.
At first, I thought there might be more than one.
Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's consider this button for a moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner. The real Examiner.
Have you? What about the Daleks?
I can. And that's why we have to stay.
I know the misery they cause, the destruction. But there's something else more terrible. Something I can only half remember.
Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?
Excuse me.
To see the Governor, of course.
Very well.
I shall radio Earth. Governor or not, Hensell will have to listen to them. I'll get Earth to back me.
That's funny. I could have sworn. You stay here. I shan't be long.
I know you're there.
I found the operator unconscious.
The cables have been cut.
Bragen, I was attacked just after I landed. This is a small souvenir I collected.
I call them what they are, Daleks.
I do.
Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?
The fools. The stupid fools.
Nothing yet.
It knew who I was.
Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony.
It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.
(to Dalek) I shall stop you. I will.
Permission? Permission for what?
But, but didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!
Very well. If not by my order, then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.
But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof, but you've no idea of the danger.
Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored.
You're my servant, are you?
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!
Huh!
That's it!
Wire. Scissors. Tape.
Ah! Congratulations, Ben!
You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are the most important thing.
So do I. Excellent. excellent.
If only we could find a. Ah, yes.
Now we're really getting somewhere!
They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.
Oh yes, it's coming on.
Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.
There we are.
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.
We'll help him Polly, but later.
Now, this is a case where a little injustice is better than wholesale slaughter. What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come along.
May I come in?
Oh, just to see how you're getting on.
No, please. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm just interested, that's all.
Well, I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Oh please, carry on.
Stop you? No, of course not. We got off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but I'm a reasonable man, and I've been thinking perhaps I was hasty.
A truce? My dear fellow, I'd like to be friends.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Perhaps you'd like to amuse yourselves for a little while.
Oh, splendid, splendid. Please, please, carry on.
I'm saving your life!
Ben, if you were a Dalek, what would be your next move?
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no! She's looking around. There's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.
Where are we going?
Hmm? Power.
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube
Now then, twenty two over three. Nineteen times
Oh, it's useless with incomplete data!
Lesterson!
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.
Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.
Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.
Not for me it isn't. Accord every access. I've got a badge.
A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.
Don't be frightened of it, Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.
Ben?
Let's get out of here.
Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run!
But if you didn't do it, Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.
But I've already explained to you.
But they must be destroyed!
Huh.
Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!
What is that to do with me?
Just exactly what do you mean by that?
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.
Accord every access.
Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?
Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.
Yes.
So, they've given you the run of the colony, have they?
Uh, uh. Examiner. I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?
The floors. They're not metal.
Static, do you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor. Some sort of electrical field.
It's madness!
Letting them run around like this.
One Dalek in Bragen's office. Three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four.
Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought.
It looks like a perfectly ordinary notice board to me.
Accord every access, remember?
Lesterson?
You haven't been building Daleks, have you?
And there were only three in the capsule?
Well, we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor.
There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves.
Machines? What makes you think they're just machines? The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
Lesterson, what's the matter?
Ben, I've found a message in code. It's an anagram, you just take the capital letters, see? Work it out yourself.
Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T -- Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P.
It's the rebel's way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there, early.
What's the time?
Yes.
Bragen.
No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.
Well, see if you can stop this one from killing me.
You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?
An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?
The one you murdered.
Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.
Hmm. Works by sound, does it?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into the open.
Yes. But did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?
Yes. It's quite a simple sort of lock, really.
But even if he knew of the danger, could he do anything? The rebels are well organised.
In that case we must get word to him.
Ah yes, but then I'm not the real Examiner.
Ben, Polly and I, we're just travellers, that's all. I found the Examiner dead. Bragen murdered him.
We aren't going to have that chance unless we can get out of here.
I wonder how they're converting the power?
The Daleks. They're powered by static electricity. It's like blood to them, a constant life-stream.
It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static, just as they've conquered anti-magnetics.
I don't seem to be able to hit the right note. Do you have any more water?
Then I shall have to get some.
Yes?
I say. I say, do you think we might have a little more water?
Wait a minute.
We don't want him trying it, although he seemed a bit tone deaf to me.
An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?
I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.
Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?
On their static power supply.
Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could. Oh well, it's a long story. But don't worry, that boy can take care of himself.
Get out, all of you!
Go!
Don't worry. The people will follow you, too.
Martial law? What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?
We shall see, shan't we.
The Dalek!
Can't you see it's armed?
Now!
Ah! There you are.
I knew you'd be all right!
The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.
Quinn, keep them both here.
Down everyone!
The window. Does it open?
It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.
The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.
The answer must be here somewhere.
The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work anymore.
Where? Where is it, Lesterson?
No. You stay here and look after Polly. I'll go.
Valmar! Where is the Dalek power?
Valmar. Valmar! Where is the Dalek power supply?
What makes you think I want to do that? We need more time. I know. A diversion. Bragen's guards. We'll have to use them to keep the Daleks busy. You go to Bragen.
Ben! Polly!
Yes, I did.
Good, because we're going inside. Come on, Valmar.
Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.
Of course I do.
Because I prefer to do it my way!
Eh? What happened? What did I do? What did I do?
Did I do that?
Did I do all that?
Oh. There was a blow back, was there?
Oh, that is unfortunate.
I did a lot of damage, did I?
I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.

What a brain. Oh ho. What a brain.
Do that again. Say Ah.
Ah! Ah, laryngitis. How can a robot catch laryngitis? I mean, what do you need it for, hmm? Romana! Laryngitis?
Romana, the dog's got laryngitis.
Sorry, I thought you were Romana. Have you seen her? What are you doing here?
Regenerating? What are you talking about, regenerating? Only Time Lords regenerate. Look, it's awfully nice to see you, Princess Astra
Romana? Ah.
Shut up, K9. What are you doing in that body?
But you can't wear that body.
But you can't go round wearing copies of bodies.
No.
Well then, go and try another one. Go on.
What's the trouble here? Preoccupation with external appearances.
Well, lengthen it then. Go on. Trying to look like other people.
It's just not important, is it, K9. (looks up) No thank you. Not today. It's what's on the inside that matters. That's what's important, isn't it, K9? Do you agree with me, K9?
Too tall. Take it away. Now, listen. You listen to me in there. What you want is something warm and sensible. Something that will wear well. Something with a bit of style and, well, style. You know.
Exactly! Good heavens, that's exactly right. Ha! I never realised you had such a sense of style.
Ah, but it's nice to get them right, though, isn't it.
Exactly.
Oh.
No, no, no, the arms are just fine. They're just fine. It's just that, oh well, all right, have it your own way. But get rid of those silly clothes, eh?
I don't know. It depends on the randomiser.
We've arrived.
I said, we've arrived. We got there.
Eh? Oh, breathable atmosphere. High degree of seismic activity.
Lots of earthquakes.
Sidekick?
Look, if you want to talk to me, will you come in here and do it, please?
Never mind.
Oh, that's fine, that's fine. Here, take a couple of those, will you?
Anti-radiation pills. The levels are quite high out here. Here's a bleeper that'll bleep when you need the next dose.
Oh look, rocks.
Good. Got to do something with K9.
You know the most important thing my cybernetics tutor ever taught me?
When replacing a brain, always make sure the arrow A is pointing to the front. Did you get that? Arrow A
Absolutely right.
I don't know. A feeling I've been here before.
Oui.
Nothing tangible. I just have a sensation. A pervading air of. Can you feel it too?
What, and never know where I've been until the end of time? I wouldn't sleep at night. Come on.
Interesting.
Very precious. In a geological sense, more precious than diamonds, but I'd need a bigger bit. Ah ha! Ha ha! I was right.
Well then, see what you make of it.
Limestone and clay making?
Add gravel.
You know something? You've got all the makings of a first class navvy. Concrete. Manufactured.
Look! The ruins of a city?
Come on.
Yes?
Let's go this way.
Don't know. Something fairly serious by the look of it.
It seemed to be coming from right under our feet.
I don't know. Underworld dentist? Come on.
Let's get closer.
Well, you try digging a hole through rock.
What? The living dead? You mean a planet ruled by zombies? I want to know who lives on this planet. With one basic difference, the living are very much like the dead. Who was it said the living are just the dead on holiday? Never mind. You should meet one. You can always tell a genuine zombie.
Skin is cold to the touch. I want to get a closer look at that body.
Listen. Sorry, did I startle you?
The deceased was a combat pilot serving with the Third Galactic Fleet of the planet Kantra.
Yes.
What's very odd, he died of exhaustion and malnutrition.
Except, wouldn't you have expected him to have died of radiation first?
Well, it's not a flying saucer.
Recognise the type?
Well, without reference to my Jane's Spacecraft of the Universe, I wouldn't dispute that.
Yeah, interesting technique. Camouflage and defence.
Yeah, probably hit it at the beginning of the tourist season. How far away would you say that was?
Well, that's just about the distance for a good bracing walk.
Yeah, well, it would be less than gracious not to welcome them. We can pretend we're couriers. Come on.
Come on, this way.
I don't know. Got it. Underground drilling.
High impact phason drills.
Yes, someone's imported some high technology.
Can't a fellow get any sleep around here?
I don't know, I can't see all of me. My extremities seem unimpaired, but I'm being squashed. Can you take some of the weight?
We're not going to move this without help. K9 could do it if he was in one piece. I've got my
Good.
Who knows?
I'd rather hoped you'd resist the temptation to say that. Don't forget the arrow.
Origins of the Universe.
Ha, ha. He got it wrong on the first line! Tut. Why didn't he ask someone who saw it happen?
Must remember to give Romana hers.
The conditions existing on the planet Magla make it incapable of supporting any lifeform. Huh. Huh. Huh. He obviously doesn't realise the planet Magla's an eight thousand mile wide amoeba that has grown a crusty shell. I wonder what he does know?
Good evening. You'll forgive me if I don't rise. It's er.
I must say how grateful I am to you charming people. I repeat how grateful I am to you charming people. You lifted that column off me as though it were a matchstick. I can't think for the life of me where you keep your muscles.
Oh, I see. Yes, part of their training, is it? Well, excuse me.
Well now, I told you a little bit about myself. What about you? What brings you to, what's this planet called, by the way?
No, no, I had a little trouble with my directional equipment.
Yes, well, something of the sort.
No.
Well, that's not much help. See, I'm terribly old-fashioned. I prefer names.
Skaro?
What are you doing here?
No, I don't understand. Why are you here on Skaro?
Commander, you must tell me what you're doing here on Skaro. It's vital.
Well, I'll tell you when you tell me what you're doing here.
Yes, thank you. Thank you, I know.
Oh, better than you could possibly imagine.
Commander, the Daleks.
I'm very familiar with their methods. It's vital I know what they're doing here.
But Commander, what
Tyssan. Tyssan, what are the Daleks mining for? Tyssan. Tyssan, what are the Daleks mining for? Come on.
Yes.
Good man, good man. Yes. Why didn't you speak to me?
Was she hurt?
Good, good.
What!
Come over here. Tyssan, it's vital I get into Dalek control. Can you show me a way?
Never mind. Can you do it?
Good.
Go back now. No more chances.
Well, you wouldn't be the first.
The connection? This is where they were created thousands of years ago. They ravaged the place and left it for dead, as you can see. SHARREL: That doesn't tell me why they should return.
No. No, indeed. Burrowing into the ruins of their own city for what? For what? Oh!
No. No, it'd be too fantastic even for the Daleks. We'll find all the answers we want in the control room. Come on.
Come on.
Good.
Don't worry.
Are you three coming?
Tyssan. Tyssan!
That looks interesting.
Ah ha. Floor plans of the old Kaled city.
Yes. Never mind about that. This is the first underground level where we are now.
That's the second. And if I'm right, the Daleks have penetrated to level there. Which means that their objective must be the third section.
I have an uneasy feeling I know. Now. That's odd. There's no plan of the fourth level.
Yes. Yes. There's a shaft leading directly from the surface to the fourth level which the Daleks can't possibly know about, otherwise they would have come from the surface to the fourth level and burrowed to the third. I wonder.
What? Stay calm.
Quick, take cover!
Come on!
Let me see.
I'm a doctor.
He is?
Yes, yes, of course. It's a privilege to meet such honourable people. Let's keep moving.
I don't know. It'd be fascinating. Shush. Shush.
Don't worry, don't worry. I don't give up easily.
After you.
You're too kind.
If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us? Bye, bye.
Romana. Ha ha! I thought you were dead.
Good girl.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Dalek hunting.
Now, if I'm right, there's a shaft in here that the Daleks don't know about leading straight to the bottom level. If I'm right.
Ah ha. I'm right. Now, if the Daleks are looking for what I think they're looking for, we've got to get there first. We don't all need to go. Why don't you two go back to your ship and wait for us?
All right. Come on, let's clear the entrance.
Call it local knowledge gained a long time ago. (to Romana) You gave me quite a start back there, you know. They've started drilling again. Now listen, we don't have much time. If I'm right, we should go this way.
Same thing as the Daleks.
I'll tell you when I find out.
Just as I thought.
Yes. Davros, the evil genius who created the Daleks.
Yes. I could have stopped him.
Yes. Curious the tricks time plays on one, isn't it.
Yes.
Romana, I was right.
Davros. You don't look a day older and I'd hoped you were dead.
Yes, well, I can see your long rest hasn't done anything to cure your megalomania. Have a jelly baby.
Shut up or I'll switch you off.
Quick, back this way.
Tyssan, back down the corridor and check it. You give me a hand with this.
It's shifting. Stand back.
Well, you didn't do that very well, did you.
No, you didn't. Tyssan?
What? Then we're effectively boxed in. We're too exposed here. Come on, get him. Let's get under cover.
Get that door up. Make some sort of barrier.
Good, good.
Well, it's got to serve. Now listen to me carefully, you two. I want you both to get out through, come over here. Good. Now, get back to the Movellan spaceship, tell them to mobilise a force and bring it here. It's vital we get Davros out of here before the Daleks find us. Off you go.
Don't take too many chances. Come on, quick.
Well. Well, now we've a little time to ourselves, I'll fill you in on some of the events that have taken place during the centuries you've been, er, dozing.
Well, Arcturus won the Galactic Olympic Games. Betelgeuse came a close second. The economy on Algo's in a terrible state due to irreversible inflation
What? Yes?
Well, let's just say I might tamper with it.
What?
Oh, that, that, yes.
Yes, yes, I've heard all that before. Now do be a good chap, eh? Stay quiet.
I've got to concentrate.
Yes, yes, yes, we've heard all that. The Daleks can do all that for themselves.
What? The Daleks left you for dead centuries ago. You've given them all you've got. What do they want you for now, eh? What's so special about the Movellans that they need your help again, eh?
There, that should do it. Very good. Well, aren't you going to ask me what it is? All right, I'll tell you anyway. Life insurance. What were we talking about?
No, no, no, we had that conversation last time we met. I'm more interested in your survival. I saw you destroyed. The Daleks blasted you at point-blank range.
Blimey, wasn't that outstaying your welcome in rather a big way?
Oh, poor Davros.
You're very generous.
Oh yes, oh yes. They've wreaked havoc and destruction, destroyed countless innocent lives
Davros, you. I have slept but now I have awakened and the universe will be. You're misquoting Napoleon! One day I'll tell you what happened to him, too.
Hold it, hold it. Now, tell them what I've got here.
And one false move and it goes right down inside his chair. I'll turn Davros and his life-support system into scrap metal. Now back off!
Do as he says.
I believe this is what's called a Mexican stand-off.
Ha, ha. Wouldn't you like to know, eh? Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't I like to know.
Now what?
Stop!
All right. All right. You can have Davros, but only on my conditions.
All slave workers to be released immediately and allowed to leave the city.
Nothing to come in here until I'm out and in the clear.
Stop! One more killing and I detonate the device. I'll destroy Davros.
Yes, you hadn't foreseen that one, had you.
Good, good. Now, I'll need one minute to get clear. Get back! I told you this was life insurance. I've adapted the device to explode by remote control.
All I have to do is squeeze my sonic screwdriver and boom, boom, Davros.
Just so long as you've got it clear.
Don't you be so sure.
Oh, a Kaled mutant. Of course. The Dalek's were originally organic lifeforms. I think you've just told me what the Daleks want with Davros, haven't you.
Tyssan.
Yes, so I've seen.
Oh, it was nothing, nothing. Where are they now?
That could be very useful, Tyssan.
Awfully decent of you. Very grateful.
Well, all in good time. There are a few things I want to do first.
I do seem to be in demand today. Come on, Tyssan.
I'm not sure she was ever for me.
Just as I thought. Just another race of robots, no better than the Daleks.
Tyssan, get back out of sight.
Robots! Of course!
One race of robots fighting another. Is she going to be all right?
Good, good.
The night the roof fell in on Agella. (soft G)
Agella, yes, how's your hand?
Are you really?
My condolences to you.
Because you'll never defeat the Daleks. Let me demonstrate. Romana?
Are you feeling all right?
Good. We're going to play a game. Now.
Paper wraps stone.
Scissors cuts paper. Ha, ha! But suppose we were two computers controlling two great battle fleets, each one working perfectly logically to outmanoeuvre the other. Well, you're robots, you try it.
Try it! Go on.
Ha! You see? You're caught in an impasse of logic. You've discovered the recipe for everlasting peace. Congratulations. I'm terribly pleased.
You play with me, eh? Come on.
Scissors cuts paper.
Paper wraps stone.
Stone blunts scissors. Again. Scissors cuts paper.
Paper wraps stone.
Stone blunts scissors.
Yes.
I will?
No, you've overlooked something. Suppose I was willing to help you to change the balance of power, which I'm not, Davros will be doing exactly the same things for the Daleks. I mean, he may be mad, but his computer skills are almost as great as mine.
(sotto) Yes. (normal) Paper wraps stone. (sotto) How?
(sotto) When I give the signal, move.
Stone blunts scissors.
Jelly baby.
Doctor catches robot.
Don't you ever speak to me like that again, you understand? Never!
Jelly baby! You keep out of this. It's a personal matter, isn't it.
So just mind your own business.
And you mind your own business, too.
Duck!
Oh well, so much for logic. A mind that can be scrambled by a dog whistle.
Yes, well, not quite. They're just power packs with some main circuits.
Yes, that's it. Tyssan! Tyssan. Well done, Tyssan. Any news of Davros?
The Daleks will be sending a ship for him. We mustn't let him get away.
One, two, three, four, five. I'll go alone. Ask me why.
They're unconscious. Also I'm a very dangerous fellow when I don't know what I'm doing. You stay here, Tyssan. You'll need this ship to get home. Romana, you help him.
I will return!
(sotto) Davros. Davros! (normal) Davros.
Hello. I didn't think getting to see you would have been so easy. Are you just going to sit there quietly and wait for the Dalek ship to pick you up?
Well, it's nice to be wanted, isn't it.
Oh?
Oh yes, two vast computers so evenly matched they can't out-think one another.
Yes.
Oh, of course.
Oh, no.
Would you have told the Daleks?
But you failed. The prisoners set me free.
Really. And how will you stop me activating that control before they reach their target?
Really?
Oh, I'm sure they'll welcome me with open arms. I mean, they would welcome me with open arms if they had arms. Please, please, no offence meant at all.
Bye, bye.
My hat!
What?
All elephants are pink. Nellie is an elephant, therefore Nellie is pink. Logical?
You know what a human would say to that?
That's why the Daleks came back for you. They remembered they were once organic creatures themselves, capable of irrational, intuitive thought, and they wanted you to give it back to them to get them out of their trap of logic.
Yes. What does it feel like?
No, but I think this little device can. It's a cryogenic freezer. Even you can't escape from a solid block of ice. Bye, bye, Davros.
That was a narrow escape. Come on, we've got some digging to do.
Of course I could. It's obvious.
Yes. Both sides were fighting with computers, perfectly logically. Each computer could predict the move of the other and counter it. Result, stalemate.
Wins the battle, yes. Make mistakes and confuse the enemy.
Yes.
Yes. What?
Mistakes? Me? Well, perhaps once a century or so.
Well, I have made the odd mistake.
What?
Oh, yes.

One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine.
Yes. Looks rather splendid, doesn't it?
Of course, once everything's run in.
Well, the Tardis is more than a machine, Tegan. It's like a person. It needs coaxing, persuading, encouraging.
You have little faith, Tegan.
It's the high bombardment of positive ions.
Same cause and reason.
For some, the Eye of Orion is the most tranquil place in the universe.
Why not? For a while. We could do with a rest.
Ah!
Just a twinge of cosmic angst.
As if I'd lost something.
Not allowed? Me? I'm allowed everywhere.
Oh, thank you. Brigadier.
Yes, yes. For once, I was able to steer the Tardis. And here I am.
I'm not too late, am I?
For your speech as guest of honour.
I saw it in the Times.
Tomorrow's Times. And, er, and who is this?
Ah. Yes, mine was pretty unpromising, too.
You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm. Don't like it.
After you.
After you.
And Omega. Don't forget Omega.
And the terrible Zodin.
Oh, you weren't concerned with her, were you? She happened in the future. They were covered in hair. Used to hop like kangaroos. Well, I must say goodbye, Brigadier. I really shouldn't be here at all. I'm not exactly breaking the laws of time, but I am bending them a little.
Brigadier, I think our past is catching up on us. Or maybe it's our future. Come on, run!
Where's it gone? We must get back to the Tardis before it's too late. Run!
It's fading. It's all fading.
Great chunks of my past, detaching themselves like melting icebergs. Ah!
Oh, no. No, don't look so worried. I'll have it all worked out soon. Everything's all right. Everything's quite all right.
Great balls of fire!
Good old Bessie.
I am being diminished. Whittled away, piece by piece. A man is the sum of his memories, you know. A Time Lord even more so.
Get me into the Tardis.
Ah! I have to find, to find
My other selves.
Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvell, Judge Jeffreys, Owen Chadwick.
Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes, some of the greatest labourers in the history of Earth have thought here.
Oh, definitely Newton.
That's right.
Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius.
Restful?
It's October.
I did. May week's in June.
So was the Tardis.
Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing can go wrong. No co-ordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just the water, the punt, a strong pair of hands and a pole.
Susan. Surely it's Susan.
I wish I knew, my dear.
Well, the important question now is where are we, and why?
(sotto) We were brought here. Perhaps the Dalek was, too.
I'm being sucked into a time vortex. Part of me there already. It's pulling the rest. I must send a signal.
I must send a signal. Find them. I must be whole.
That may be precisely what we need.
No, no, no, don't argue, Susan. Listen to me. Now, when I say now, help me to push the Dalek down that alley, and when I say drop, drop. Understood?
Now, Susan!
Drop!
It's very dangerous to fire energy weapons in an enclosed space.
The Dark Tower.
The Death Zone.
Instinct, my dear, tells me that the answer to that lies in the Tower.
My dear Brigadier, it's no use blaming me.
I'm not sure, but I have some very nasty suspicions. What's that?
Over there.
No, get down.
Don't worry, Brigadier.
Run!
Now what?
Hang on a minute.
Catch hold of this.
I think we should come away from the ledge, don't you?
Of course it's me. Hello, Sarah Jane.
That's right.
Teeth and curls?
Yes, well, maybe I did, but I haven't yet.
Steady on, Sarah Jane. I'm not exactly here by choice either, you know.
Well, I'll try and explain. Come on, get in the car.
I've got to. What is it I've got to do?
Ah yes, of course. A recall signal.
I must send the signal. They'll hear it. That'll bring them.
It's, it's
Oh, it's no good. I shall have to rest.
Yes, yes.
Hmm? What? Goodness me! The Tardis!
I suggest we go and find out.
More to the point, what are you young people doing inside my Tardis?
And who might he be?
Hmm? Good grief.
You're here. You're here.
Yes, evidently. Now, take it steadily, my boy, and let me help you up.
I tried to send a recall signal.
Yes, it doesn't matter. How do you come to be here?
Well, the Tardis was, er. I don't know.
Never mind that.
Me? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so. Regeneration?
Fourth.
Goodness me! So, there are five of me now! Oh, er, this is Susan.
Yes, I know.
And, er, you two are
I might be any number of things, young lady. As it happens, I am the Doctor. The original, you might say.
Certainly not.
It only happens in the gravest emergencies.
Like now.
Yes, unfortunately.
Now look, young lady. Make yourself useful. This young fellow looks as though he needs some refreshment and I know that Susan and I do, too.
Tegan, Tegan, Tegan. Humour him. You know, I sometimes used to get a little tetchy. Fortunately one mellows with age. Turlough will help.
And now, young fellow, tell me all about it.
It's just as I feared. We're on Gallifrey, in the Death Zone.
To my shame. Yes, mine, Brigadier, and that of every other Time Lord. In the days before Rassilon, my ancestors had tremendous powers which they misused disgracefully. They set up this place, the Death Zone, and walled it around with an impenetrable force field, and then they kidnapped other beings and set them down here.
I'll explain as we go.
To the Tower. To Rassilon, the greatest single figure in Time Lord history.
Not exactly, Brigadier. It's his tomb.
You're talking nonsense, my boy. We must send the signal as planned and wait for the others.
No, there's no time. We must leave immediately. Temporal instability's already affecting me.
And without our other selves, we'll be of little use out there.
Well, they'll never make it. There is evil at work.
We're in the Death Zone on Gallifrey.
Well, the Tomb of Rassilon. Look, can we really afford to wait, especially if someone is tapping his power?
Well, what do you intend to do, young man?
I shall go to the Tower.
But there could be great danger.
Help me set up the computer scanner. We can at least see what is out there.
All this was the setting for the games. But old Rassilon put a stop to it in the end. He sealed off the entire Zone and forbade the use of the Time Scoop, until now.
Because they delight in deviousness, that's why. It amuses them, chucking us in the deep end, watching us sink or swim.
So I can get my bearings. Ah ha. There it is.
The Tomb of Rassilon. That's where we're going.
What I've always done, Sarah Jane. Improvise.
I don't know. No, it couldn't be.
Jehosophat, it really is you. Yes, well, I should have known you'd be behind all this.
That's my best enemy. He likes to be known as the Master, don't you? My, my, my, but you've changed. Another regeneration?
I take it you are responsible for our being in the Death Zone?
You? Sent here by the Time Lords to help me? I've never heard such arrant nonsense.
Yes, forged, no doubt.
Stolen, then. I'll return it at the first opportunity.
You? Help me? Rubbish. This is some kind of a trap.
I knew it, a trap.
You just watch me.
Now, as far as I can make out, there are three entrances. One above, one below, and the main door here.
Which do you plan to use?
Er, well, the main door.
I still think you should wait.
There may be very little time.
You see what I mean? A trap.
I wonder, could Rassilon himself have brought us here?
Oh, it is, but no one really knows how extensive his powers were.
Watching us at this very moment.
So the official history says, but there are many rumours and legends to the contrary. Some say his fellow Time Lords rebelled against his cruelty and locked him in the Tower in eternal sleep.
Well, it would explain a great deal. Oh dear.
We could be playing the Game of Rassilon at this very moment.
Come on.
Er, release the Tardis. The computer scanner's located the force field generator.
Hmm.
No. I think it would be safer if you were to remain here with me.
Er, yes, yes, all right. Now, you'll bring the Tardis to the Tower as soon as I switch off the force field.
Of course.
Yes, of course. Right, better get started. Time's running out.
Eureka.
We are.
Because the mountains are between us and the Tower, Sarah. That's why.
No, it'd take far too long.
So, the Master has used the Time Scoop to bring others as well as us here. Come on, let's get out of here.
It depends on what may try to stop him, my boy. Oh, it's not without reason that it's called the Death Zone. Great heavens. Two more traces.
Two more Doctors. The scanner is keyed to my, to our brain patterns. Well, well, well, so two of them made it. I wonder what happened to the other.
(singing) Who to Rassilon's Tower would go, must choose below. No, no, no Who unto Rassilon's Tower will go, must choose above, between, below.
Age has not mellowed you, has it, Brigadier? I was recalling, in point of fact, an old nursery rhyme about the Dark Tower.
Considerably more than you do. It describes the different ways to enter the Tower.
Nevertheless, I propose to put it to the test.
Come along. In here.
Soon be there.
Wait here.
Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. Go on.
I am. I listened.
And not humiliate me first? Oh, that isn't your style at all.
So you say. I would prefer more positive proof of your credentials.
Do you expect me to believe the fantastic tale you've just told?
Go back!
After you.
Zapped.
Sorry, must dash.
Quite a reception committee.
And then?
Hmm.
Well, from the way Susan described it, a transmat device.
Well, with our young friend gone, I shall have to go to the Dark Tower.
Oh. Oh, well, if you must. Thank you, my dear.
It seems I've done the Master an injustice.
Well, this changes things. If the Master isn't responsible, then who is misusing the Death Zone?
Who has control of the Time Scoop?
But the machinery still exists.
Yes, I am rather.
I think it would be quite an important one, as well.
No. No, not yet.
Cybermen. Whoever brought me and my other selves here also brought them. Now, you know our legends well enough. Even in our most corrupt period our ancestors never allowed the Cybermen to play the game. Like the Daleks, they play too well.
Then there's this. You know, the Death Zone is a large place, and yet the Cybermen found us very quickly. Almost as if they were supposed to.
Especially when helped. This is the one thing the Master would be sure to keep on him at all times. The recall device. And within.
A homing beacon.
Come along, Brigadier, come along. This way.
You never were. Cheer up, we're getting along very nicely.
2: We should be at the Tower very soon. The tunnel's rising all the time.
It sounded like something very large and very fierce, and probably very hungry. Come on.
No, it's not. Look.
Yes, well, I'll help you. Anyway, we can't go back.
They don't get tired, that's why not. And they never give up.
Wait!
Look. A Raston Warrior robot. The most perfect killing machine ever devised.
Quick, over there.
Their armaments are built in, and sensors detect movement. Any movement.
Yes. They move like lightning. (The Robot leaps and vanishes from sight. They stand up and it lands nearby then jumps back to the cave entrance.)
Playing with us.
3: Right, come on.
Freeze, Sarah Jane. If you move, we're dead.
Well, of course I can, young woman. And kindly refrain from addressing me as Doc.
Interesting. I thought they were out of print.
Let me speak to him.
Was that really necessary?
It seems you have been saved the embarrassment of a trial.
Yes. Yes, I, I should be getting back to them.
I can't abandon them.
Are they all in the Zone?
Oh! In here. Oh, oh!
Hold this. Must be something.
Ah!
Pardon?
It's a Galactic Glitter.
It's a Yeti!
It must have been left over from the Games.
Well, at least it can't get at us.
Yes, I'm afraid we are. On the other hand, where there's a wind, there's a way.
Well, I think we've arrived.
I don't like this at all. Someone or something wants us to go inside. After you, Brigadier.
Hang on, Sarah Jane, hang on. I think we've got one hope.
Now.
Look what we've got, Sarah Jane. The Robot's extra arrows. At least we'll have something to have a fight with. Wait a minute, these might come in handy.
Come on.
What a splendid idea.
At the moment I'm more concerned for the High Council. For Gallifrey.
Has he? You know, I've known the Castellan too long. Oh, he was limited, a little narrow, but always fiercely loyal to his oath of office. Any mention of the Dark days filled him with horror. Now, you saw his reaction to the Black Scrolls. It wasn't that of a man discovered, but of sheer disbelief. No, I'm convinced the traitor is still at large.
Thank you. And I must speak to the Lord President.
Yes, well, see if you can hold them off. I won't be a second.
Right, that should do it.
Well, maybe not. Can you think of a better suggestion? No? All right then, stand well back.
I've got you. Now, find a foot hold. Find any foot hold.
Have you got one?
Right. Now, let go this hand
Hold both loops in one hand. Both loops in one hand. I've got the other one. Right, come on. That's it. Now, find another foot hold. I've got you. Put it on that ledge. Can you find that ledge?
Good. All right, up you come. Up you come.
Don't look down!
Come on. Up. That's it.
Come on. There you are. That's it.
Well done. Enjoy the flight?
Through here, would you believe?
It looks very much like a bell to me.
Don't be in such a hurry.
It could cost you your life.
Patience, child.
Diabolical ingenuity! Nothing happens until you reach the fifth row, half way, and then the entire board becomes a death trap.
Do I know you, young man?
What an extraordinary fellow. As easy as pie? As easy as pie?
No, he didn't! He said easy as pi. The Greek letter pi. Surely you know some basic mathematics, child?
Exactly. You find the safe path by using the mathematical formula pi. Oh, but the application, the application. Now, let me see, now. Three point one four one five nine two six five. Yes, that's it! You stay there, child.
Now!
President Borusa, I. I thought you said the Lord President was in here.
You're sure about that, are you?
No power. He couldn't have left that way. Inform Chancellor Flavia that the Lord President has disappeared, would you?
Yes. Yes, I can feel it too, Sarah. It's the mind of Rassilon. We must be nearing the tomb. Now, you've got to fight it. You must keep your mind under control.
Sit down here. Sit down. Rest for a moment. All right?
I won't be a second.
Mike? Mike Yates? How did you get here?
Good heavens.
Hello, Liz. Any more of you?
Huh, not that little fellow in the checked trousers and the black frock coat.
Oh, good grief.
Yes, well, you wait here for a moment. I'll go and get Sarah.
No, I, er, I think I'll go, Mike. She's nervous enough as it is.
No, I think I'll go, thanks.
How? You're phantoms, illusions of the mind!
Sarah?
They were just phantoms from the past.
Yes. Yeah, you're real enough. Come on. (They head off in the other direction.)
Full of strange fears and mysterious forebodings?
No, as a matter of fact, I don't. It's all illusion, child. We're close to the domain of Rassilon, whose mind is reaching out to attack us. Just ignore it, as I do.
Fear itself is largely an illusion. And at my age, there's little left to fear. Hmm. No, there's nothing here to harm us.
2: What you feel is fear, Brigadier, projecting from the mind of Rassilon.
No. It may be a trap. I'll go and see. You wait here.
Oh, very well, but don't get in the way.
Take this.
We'll go and see.
Jamie! Zoe!
Why, what's happening?
A force field? We'll soon see about that.
Get them out of it.
I can't. I can't leave you there.
But Zoe and Jamie would still be trapped.
Or would they? Just a minute. It's a matter of memory.
Why? I can't harm you.
You can't kill illusions.
You're not real. When you were returned to your own people, the Time Lords erased your memory of the period you spent with me. So how do you know who we are? Answer!
Yes, yes, it's sad.
You want to get home?
That is why we are here. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray?
Yes, well, this will be the exception. Come along.
The Harp of Rassilon. I never knew he was musical. Borusa either for that matter.
Interesting. A musical key. A combination of notes. A tune.
Ah, there you are at last, dear fellow. What kept you?
What kept me? Of all the confounded arrogance.
Never mind, never mind, you can tell me later. Come and take a look at this.
What is it?
Hmm. Fascinating.
What happened to the little fellow?
The little fellow is perfectly all right, thank you very much. Of course I'm here. You don't imagine anything you two could do could stump me, do you? Let's have a look. What's this?
Lethbridge Stewart? Oh, my dear fellow. How very nice to see you again.
You'll have to excuse me, old chap. We've got a very important inscription to translate and I think they'll get it all wrong without me.
So, that's what it's all about. I never dreamed.
It changes nothing, absolutely nothing. We lower the forcefield, get the young fellow back from Gallifrey and all go home. This doesn't concern us. It mustn't.
You. Tell them.
It's Old High Gallifreyan, the ancient language of the Time Lords. Not many people understand it these days.
Fortunately, I do.
That this is the Tomb of Rassilon, where Rassilon lies in eternal sleep.
It also says that anyone who's got this far has passed many dangers and shown great courage and determination. What does this bit mean?
To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose.
I know what it says. What does it mean?
It also promises that whoever takes the ring from Rassilon's hand and puts it on shall get the reward he seeks.
Immortality.
That is what the word means, young man.
Apparently not.
It seems Rassilon possesses it now, and is willing to share it with whoever takes the ring.
Out of the question.
You're hardly a suitable candidate.
For anything.
Well, if it is a tune, what could it be? A tune like, a tune like. A tune like the one that's been under my nose all the time perhaps.
Lord President.
Not at first. Your little charade fooled me for a while.
Oh, Borusa. What's happened to you?
Oh, you've done great service. It was only right you should become President.
Oh, I understand. You want to be President throughout all your remaining regenerations.
Immortality? Oh, that's impossible, even for a Time Lord.
Well, I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow, so the Tardis should be free of the forcefield now.
I'll try to get through to the Capitol.
But not the final secret.
So, you sent me to the Zone to deal with them for you.
Only you botched it, didn't you? One of my selves is trapped in a time vortex, endangering my very existence.
Oh, I would not serve you.
And very fetching it is, too.
Can you hear me, old fellow?
Calling the Capitol, calling the Capitol. This is the Doctor speaking. Well, one of them. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Doctor? Is there anybody there? Calling the Capitol.
Yes, I'm here.
Ah, there I am. I mean, there you are.
We've reached the Tower. We're all safe. The barriers are down and the Tardis is here. And I say, we've made the most extraordinary discovery.
I know what you have discovered. Do not transmit further. Stay where you are and touch nothing. President Borusa is arriving to take full charge.
Touch nothing, indeed? Who does he think he is.
He didn't want us to mention the Ring of Rassilon. Natural enough.
Something's wrong, you know.
You haven't changed. Still finding menace in your own shadow.
I feel the same.
Oh. Well, we shall soon see, won't we.
You brought us here?
He's after the Ring of Rassilon. He wants immortality.
And you were the one who didn't sense anything was wrong.
He's a renegade. No better than that villain down there.
We can't allow it, you know.
The Tomb was sealed for the best of reasons.
And as soon as we're back to our own time streams, it must be sealed again. Permanently!
Doctor, we need you. Join us.
He can't. Some kind of mind lock. Fight it, my boy, fight it. Concentrate. We must be one.
You see, Borusa? Together, we're a match for you.
We don't need to. Soon, Chancellor Flavia will be here with her guards, or can you overcome the whole High Council?
No, wait, my boy. That was the voice of Rassilon. It's out of our hands now.
It most certainly is not.
Don't believe him.
It's nonsense.
Don't listen to them, Lord Rassilon. President Borusa speaks the truth.
Indeed I do.
That's very kind of you. No. No, no thank you!
No, my Lord. All we ask is that we be returned to our proper place in time and space.
One of us is trapped.
Did you know what would happen?
Hmm? Oh, I'm so sorry. I suddenly realised what the old proverb meant. To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose. It was all part of Rassilon's trap to find out who wanted immortality and put him out of the way. He knew very well that immortality was a curse, not a blessing.
Well, now it seems we must part, just as I was getting to know me.
So, you're the latest model, hmm?
Yes, and the most agreeable.
Certainly the most impudent.
And our dress sense hasn't improved much, has it?
Neither our manners. Well, goodbye, my boy. You did quite well, quite well. It's reassuring to know that my future is in safe hands. Come along, Susan.
Time to go, Brigadier. Well, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, fancy pants.
Scarecrow.
Bring it along, would you, Brigadier?
Goodbye.
Brigadier.
Well, goodbye, my dear chap. I must say, I've had the time of my lives. Haven't we, Sarah Jane?
Thank you, Sarah Jane, it was nice meeting you, too.
I'll explain later.
I'm definitely not the man I was, thank goodness.
Watch.
Temporal fission. Old Rassilon is very clever.
Unavailable. It seems the legend about Rassilon is true.
Oh, must I?
My what?
Oh, no.
Very well, Chancellor Flavia. You will return to Gallifrey immediately and summon the High Council. You have full deputy powers until I return. I shall travel in my Tardis.
You will address me by my proper title. I am President, am I not? You will obey my commands. (to Tegan and Turlough) Into the Tardis. (to the guards) You will escort Chancellor Flavia back to her duties.
Hold tight.
Will it?
Who said anything about Gallifrey?
I told her she had full deputy powers until I returned.
You know, sometimes, Tegan, you take my breath away.
Furious.
Why not? After all, that's how it all started.

So it seems.
No.
March the fourth, 1215.
Yes, it is.
I don't think so, but something certainly isn't right.
Just for a moment.
So he does.
Lucifer?
Without a doubt.
Demons? Very odd indeed.
Must you?
He even seems pleased to see us. A king welcoming demons.
Oh, Tegan. 1215? King John, of course.
Well, you could put it like that. This particular shirt turned out to be the Crown Jewels, but that's next year. We're still three months away from Magna Carta.
Her name is Tegan, your Majesty. This is Turlough, and I am the Doctor. We are not demons.
Your Majesty, if I may make so bold.
If this is trial by combat, your Majesty, there's clearly a victor and a vanquished. Must blood be shed?
You are alive, my friend.
Thank you.
By eating lots of food.
Thank you. Where's Turlough?
Hmm. Another way of keeping warm.
We were invited for a meal.
Here, put this around you.
Do you know, it's just sunk in. March the fourth, 1215.
There's something very wrong here.
The King takes the oath today.
To take the cross as a Crusader. But he did that in London.
Your history books.
No, no, too well documented.
I care.
He wasn't.
Forced into signing Magna Carta. He was as much for it as anyone.
Do you?
Well, given the times he lives in, yes. But don't take my word for it. You'll be able to judge for yourself. Nobody forced Magna Carta from him. He could have crushed that rebellion as easily as that.
We are not demons and we've done no harm to the King, or to anyone. Nor do we intend any.
From an outer province.
Yes, well. Please believe that we are friends. If you're in trouble, I would like to help if I can.
Yes, yes, we seem to have mislaid Turlough. How long has the King been here?
Well, could he be ill?
This Sir Gilles.
Well, I can't say I care for him much myself. A French knight. Is he the only Frenchman with the King?
Could Sir Gilles be bringing some pressure, some influence on the King?
When does he return to London?
Your cousin was summoned to London?
Today, March the fourth.
What if your guest was not the King?
An imposter.
Be vigilant, my Lord. I suspect things are not what they seem.
No, no, and I ask you to trust me, please.
Thank you, we would be delighted.
Warmer?
We will.
A while longer, then we'll go.
(sotto) Trust me.
(sotto) Stop fussing.
If he's not the King, who is he and why?
Why didn't he react like everybody else? Why wasn't he scared? And why are we his demons?
Your Majesty.
Oh, indeed no, sire, but surely such a fate is too mild. Would not boiling in oil be a more fitting end?
I thank your Majesty, but I was not suggesting alternative retribution. My interruption was provoked by shock.
Yes, I was quite shocked at Sir Gilles' monstrous lack of good taste.
In my view, it is the worst possible taste to even think about following the King's quite remarkable performance. One just can't follow that.
Fortunately, we are in England. May I?
Thank you. I hope I don't disgrace it. In case of accidents
In case of accidents, find Turlough.
You escaped from Xeriphas.
Not at all. You may disguise your features, but you can never disguise your intent.
You know I can't.
It is sufficient, your Majesty, that your Champion is disarmed.
Sire, I must intercede. As victor, I beg you to be merciful.
Your Majesty!
He's using that imposter to bring the real King John into disrepute. And now he thinks he's trapped us into doing his dirty work for him.
See what I mean?
Ready, sire.
That's you.
Your Majesty does me great honour. And my first action in this role shall be to arrest that man. Arrest Sir Geoffrey de Lacy.
Unhand him. He is a man of honour. Lord Ranulf, is there a dungeon in this castle?
Sir Geoffrey, do you know it?
I must insist you lead me to the dungeon.
You have no choice. Must I remind you that my sovereign lord holds the Lady Isabella hostage?
No, my friends, attend the King. I have no need of assistance. Your Majesty. Sir Geoffrey.
What?
In the interest of security, where is the Master most likely to house his Tardis?
Quite so.
You've seen another Tardis. Release him.
Quite so.
There is no Sir Gilles. He is the Master in disguise. Now, you could call him a demon. Sir Geoffrey, you are no longer a prisoner. Release him.
A friend, who wants to help. The Master has set up an imposter as King John of England.
To change the course of history.
He wants to rob the world of Magna Carta. Small time villainy by his standards, but nevertheless something I intend to stop if at all possible.
To gain time, and access to this.
You know the true king?
Then we must get you to London so you can warn him.
Oh, I can get you there much quicker than that.
Yes, but first we must bring it here, into the castle.
No, we must bring the imposter with us.
To expose the Master's plan. Now, come along. (to gaoler) If you so much as touch this, something very nasty will happen to you.
As a matter of fact, I am.
The Master, of course.
Back to square one.
I'm sorry, Sir Geoffrey.
Well, not for Sir Gilles. All the Master has to do is set coordinates.
The same place he keeps the King.
Ah, I wonder if you'd be so good as to show me to the King's chamber. I must insist. I am the King's Champion.
So I see. Where was it?
Safely on his way to London.
He should be there in a few hours.
The coordinates will be set. Get into the Tardis.
Your Majesty seems in need of a doctor.
Your work.
This is your King John?
Impressive.
Interesting.
And controlled by?
Can anyone play?
So Kamelion here is bad King John.
It's cunning of you to confirm the superstitions put about by the monks.
A gift.
The King turns the Barons solidly against him, he is killed in battle or deposed, possibly in favour of King Phillip of France. He cannot therefore offer Magna Carta. What do you think of it so far?
Thus the foundations of parliamentary democracy will never be laid.
You cannot be allowed to alter the course of history, even indirectly.
I shall have to give it some thought.
And you haven't your compressor.
So do I.
He has a mind of his own?
And where will you take your toy next?
I may not need to. You forget, Kamelion does have a mind of his own.
Yes, but for how much longer?
No?
You won't win, not ultimately.
Earth is a primitive planet. You won't succeed so easily elsewhere.
You'll never succeed.
Safely in my Tardis.
Yes. Yes, I'm not a demon for nothing.
Turlough!
Let me present Kamelion.
Well, Tegan, it's a long story which appears to begin on Xeriphas.
Oh, it will end with the Master.
Well, he's without Kamelion now, and he won't be on Earth for much longer. I took the opportunity of leaving his compressor activated. Won't do his dimension circuits much good. He could end up anywhere except where he wants to go.
I don't know.
Why not? He's harmless.
And a very fine mind it is too.
Of course.
I apologise for Tegan's bad manners.
It seems you're outvoted.
As you wish.
I'm taking you home.
Your own time. I assume that's where you'd prefer to be.
Of course you do. You don't have to pretend. It's a shame, of course. There were many wonders I wanted to show you.
The Eye of Orion.
But you wish to return home.
You don't?
All right. You won't regret it, I promise you.
No. That's where we're going.

The red planet.
Oh, beautiful.
The Doctor. Doctor. Fun.
Actually, chat's second on my list, the first being gun pointed at my head. Which then puts my head second and chat third, I think. Gun, head, chat, yeah. I hate lists. But you could hurt someone with that thing. Just put it down.
Can you find me someone who wouldn't?
Because I give you my word. And forty million miles away from home, my word is all you've got.
Oh right, so you control that thing. Auto-glove response.
It's a bit flimsy.
Does it have to keep saying that?
I hate funny robots.
Right, yes, okay, you got me. So, I'm the Doctor, and you are?
You're the first? The very first humans on Mars? Then this is
Number one. Founded July 1st, 2058. Established Bowie Base One in the Gusev Crater. You've been here how long?
2059. It's 2059, right now. Oh! My head is so stupid. You're Captain Adelaide Brooke. And Ed. You're Deputy Edward Gold. Tarak Ital, MD. Nurse Yuri Kerenski. Senior Technician Steffi Ehrlich. Junior Technician Roman Groom. Geologist Mia Bennett. You're only twenty seven years old.
Oh, they'll never forget them. What's the date, today? What is it? Tell me the exact date.
Right. Okay, fine.
I should go. I really should go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry with all of my hearts, but it's one of those very rare times when I've got no choice. It's been an honour. Seriously, a very great honour to meet you all. The Martian pioneers.
Oh, thank you. Ah.
Thank you. There's the other two. Hold on. Margaret Cain and Andrew Stone.
Oh, I really should go.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Er, I'd love to help, but I'm leaving right now.
Oh, I just open my mouth and words come out. They don't make much sense.
Thank you, Doctor.
I hate robots. Did I say?
It's not the robots, it's the people. Dressing them up and giving them silly voices. Like you're reducing them.
Ah well, dogs. That's different.
I've read all that stuff about you, Captain Adelaide. But one thing they never said. Was it worth it, the mission?
No, but all of it. Because they say you sacrificed everything. Devoted your whole life to get here.
Ah. That's the Adelaide Brooke I always wanted to meet. The woman with starlight in her soul.
Don't touch her!
Don't touch her. Use the gloves.
There you go.
Screwdriver.
I don't know. Sounds like me. The maintenance man of the universe.
Quite an achievement. First flower on Mars in ten thousand years. And you're growing veg!
Still, fair enough. Christmas.
You've got birds!
Good sign.
Well, they're still alive.
Where was he?
Andy, just leave him alone.
I can help, I promise. I can help. Just leave that man alone.
Andy, I'm asking you to take your hand away from him and listen to me.
There now, that's better, hmm? So, you must be Andy. Hello.
We've got to go.
Set the seals on maximum!
Can you talk? Human beings are sixty percent water, which makes them the perfect host.
I don't know. I never will. Because I've got to go. Whatever's started here, I can't see it to the end. I can't.
This thing's airtight, yeah?
It depends how clever the water is.
Abandon ship!
They can run faster than us. We need a lift.
Get on behind me.
Not any more. Trust me.
Gadget gadget.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
I do.
Water is patient, Adelaide. Water just waits. It wears down the clifftops, the mountains, the whole of the world. Water always wins. Come on.
Blimey, it's a distance. You could do with bikes in this place.
Yeah, I know. But bikes.
Hoorghwall in schtochman ahn warrellinsh och fortabellan iin hoorgwahn.
Ancient North Martian.
And her eyes are different. They're clear, like she's closer to human.
Where do you get your water from?
Tons of water. Marvellous.
Looks like it, yeah.
Look at her mouth. All blackened, like there's some sort of fission. This thing, whatever it is, doesn't just hide in water, it creates water. Tell me what you want.
Sorry, sorry, but, Action One, that means evacuation, yeah?
Of course, the only problem is
The problem is, this thing is clever. It didn't infect the birds or the insects in the biodome, it chose the humans. You were chosen. And I told you, Adelaide, water can wait. Tarak changed straight away, but when Maggie was infected it stayed hidden inside her, no doubt so it could infiltrate the Central Dome. Which means
And if you take that back to Earth, one drop. Just one drop.
Right. I should leave. Finally, I should leave. Yuri, me old mate, no point in me seeing the ice field. No point at all. No. Adelaide!
All I'm saying is, bikes. Little foldaway bikes. Don't weigh a thing.
They tell legends of Mars from long ago, of a fine and noble race who built an empire out of snow. The Ice Warriors.
Perhaps they found something down there. Used their might and their wisdom to freeze it.
Well, you're famous.
This moment, this precise moment in time, it's like. I mean, it's only a theory, what do I know, but I think certain moments in time are fixed. Tiny, precious moments. Everything else is in flux, anything can happen, but those certain moments, they have to stand. This base on Mars with you, Adelaide Brooke, this is one vital moment. What happens here must always happen.
I don't know. I think something wonderful happens. Something that started fifty years ago, isn't that right?
You told your daughter. And maybe one day she tells the story to her daughter. The day the Earth was stolen and moved across the universe. And you
But not for revenge.
That's what makes you remarkable. And that's how you create history.
Imagine it, Adelaide, if you began a journey that takes the human race all the way out to the stars. It begins with you, and then your granddaughter, you inspire her, so that in thirty years Susie Fontana Brooke is the pilot of the first lightspeed ship to Proxima Centauri. And then everywhere, with her children, and her children's children forging the way. To the Dragon Star, the Celestial Belt of the Winter Queen, the Map of the Watersnake Wormholes. One day a Brooke will even fall in love with a Tandonian prince, that's the start of a whole new species. But everything starts with you, Adelaide. From fifty years ago to right here, today. Imagine.
As consolation.
A filter! One tiny little filter and then the Flood.
What about?
I don't know.
You should be with the others.
Except you won't. You could have shot Andy Stone, but you didn't.
I loved you for that. Imagine, imagine you knew something. Imagine you found yourself somewhere. I don't know, Pompeii.
Imagine you were in Pompeii.
And you tried to save them.
But in doing so, you make it happen. Anything I do just makes it happen.
You're taking Action One. There are four more standard action procedures. And Action Five is?
The final option. The nuclear device at the heart of the Central Dome. Today, on the twenty first of November 2059, Captain Brooke activates that device, taking the base and all her crew members with her. No one ever knows why. But you were saving Earth. That's what inspires your granddaughter. She takes your people out into the galaxy because you die on Mars. You die today. She flies out there like she's trying to meet you.
But your death creates the future.
I can't.
I'm sorry, but I can't. Sometimes I can, sometimes I do. Most times I can save someone, or anyone. But not you. You wondered all your life why that Dalek spared you. I think it knew. Your death is fixed in time for ever. And that's right.
No.
Captain Adelaide Brooke.
I'm not just a Time Lord, I'm the Last of the Time Lords. They'll never come back. Not now. I've got a Tardis. Same old life, last of the Time Lords. And they died and took it all with them. The walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed, gone for ever. The Time Lords kept their eye on everything. It's gone now. But they died, the Time Lords! All of them, they died. I'm the last of the Time Lords.
Mia, take this sealant, fix that leak. Yuri, open emergency oxygen. Adelaide, don't just sit there. That's better. The Dome's still got integrity! It's ten feet of steel-combination, made in Liverpool. Magnificent workmanship.
No, because someone told me just recently. They said I was going to die. They said he will knock four times, and I think I know what that means, and it doesn't mean right here, right now, because I don't hear anyone knocking, do you?
Three knocks is all you're getting.
Water and electricity, bad mix. Now then, what else have we got?
Heat! They use water, so we can use heat. Works against the Ice Warriors, works against the Flood. Ramp up the environment controls and steam them.
Yes, because there are laws. There are Laws of Time. Once upon a time there were people in charge of those laws, but they died. They all died. Do you know who that leaves? Me! It's taken me all these years to realise the Laws of Time are mine, and they will obey me!
I'm not beaten yet. I'll go outside, find the heat regulator.
Not beaten. Not beaten! You've got spacesuits in the next section.
We're not just fighting the Flood, we're fighting time itself. And I'm going to win!
Think-a think-a think-a think. What have we got? Not enough oxygen. Protein packs, useless. Glacier, glacier mints, minty, Monty, molto bene, bunny, bonny, bish bash bosh. Argh. The room, the room, look at the room. Section F. What's in Section F? Anyone!
Storing what?
Atom clamps. Atom clamps? Who needs atom clamps? I love a funny robot.
You take that. Good boy.
Off we go then.
Come on, come on!
Adelaide? What are you doing?
If I have to fight you as well, then I will.
Blast off!
Faster!
And we're in! Ha, ha.
Isn't anyone going to thank me?
He's lost his signal. Doesn't know where he is.
Don't you get it? This is the twenty first of November 2059. It's the same day on Earth. And it's snowing. I love snow.
Just think though. Your daughter, and your daughter's daughter, you can see them again. Family reunion.
Not any more.
Nah! Captain Adelaide can inspire her face to face. Different details, but the story's the same.
Tough.
Adelaide, I've done this sort of thing before. In small ways, saved some little people, but never someone as important as you. Oh, I'm good.
For a long time now, I thought I was just a survivor, but I'm not. I'm the winner. That's who I am. The Time Lord Victorious.
No.
That's for me to decide. Now, you'd better get home. Oh, it's all locked up. You've been away. Still, that's easy.
All yours.
Not any more.
I've gone too far. Is this it? My death? Is it time?
No.

That's the problem with young people today, no spirit of adventure.
I think that's enough of that, Mel.
Well, if you want to stay here watching a guide book when you could actually be enjoying the real thing, that's up to you.
Paradise Towers any second now.
You may want to lie by the pool doing nothing all day. I intend to explore. Paradise Towers is supposed to be a remarkable architectural achievement, I'm told. Won all sorts of awards way back in the er, twenty first century. Are you ready?
Well, here we are.
Ah! Highly intelligent creatures. Just look at this.
Extraordinary. Oh, and this.
Nothing's just rubbish if you have an enquiring mind.
Well, you never can tell.
Why did I have to jettison the pool from the Tardis?
There is a rather spectacular swimming pool on the planet Griophos, I understand.
Just one snag.
It's for the exclusive use of the Gulmaris.
A rather nasty breed of flesh eating octopi. Personally, I'd rather stay here and explore. I wonder what happened?
That's the spirit, Mel. This could be fascinating. Are you coming?
Oh, very well. But we've only just arrived. There's no need to start worrying yet.
At least tell us who you are.
The Red Kangs, I gather. There are other colour Kangs?
Why is that?
Not got very enquiring minds, have you?
Who are, of course, the best. They seem to be some sort of gang. All girls, by the looks of it. Perhaps they'll ask you to join up, Mel.
Pardon?
Ah, now we're getting somewhere. I'm the Doctor.
How do you do.
I was only trying to be friendly.
Say hello. Hello? Hello?
You don't have to do that. What about Mel, then?
What's the matter?
Oh, thank you very much. But clothes don't maketh the man, you know.
Red Kangs are best. Yes, well, now, that we've been introduced, I think that some explanations are in order. We're visitors to Paradise Towers, only just arrived, so you can't really expect Mel to understand what you're talking about.
Pardon?
You mean visitors aren't allowed?
There's always a first time. I mean, not everyone you're going to meet's going to be a Kang.
And?
I see. And who are these, er, Caretakers?
I see. And all the young ones are Kangs.
Or girls, I should say. There don't seem to be any boys.
I see. Well, I must say it's been nice meeting you, but I think it's time we ought to be on our way&gt; Don't you think so, Mel?
Did you? Oh, I expect your ears were playing tricks on you.
I wonder if Blue Kangs behave like this.
The art of knot tying hasn't died out here, anyway.
They liked my clothes, which is clearly not enough.
Excuse me.
Did you say a whole tribe of Yellow Kangs have been wiped out, I mean, made unalive, just like that? But why? You didn't kill them, did you?
Who did it, then? The Caretakers? The Blue Kangs? I mean, who?
Sorry about the pool, Mel.
That doesn't matter. Are you the Caretakers?
And you take care. Of people, that is.
You seem to be our best bet so far, don't you think so, Mel? Mel? Where's Mel?
Well?
And that means?
Oh, very generous of you. It must be a job trying to keep these corridors clean and tidy like this.
Oh, that's what you call them. Wallscrawlers.
By my two tickers, what's that?
It looks like a Kang, and something attacking her. Some sort of claw. Oh here, there's a drill and down here there's a nozzle sucking things up.
Let's hope they're just silly pictures. What's that?
Oh, I see. It's some sort of robotic cleaner with automotive bicurval scraping blades. Impressive workmanship.
No, I don't, but I intend to. Now, let's have a look at this automotive blades, shall we? Ah, yes.
Do you usually do what I usually do in these circumstances?
Run!
But I thought you said the lifts here don't work?
Here, let me.
Going up?
Greetings.
And I am
Wait a minute! Listen.
Well, I'm not the Great Architect. I'm the Doctor.
You can't condemn me without trial, without evidence, without proof. I mean, I don't even know who this Great Architect is.
Anything the matter?
Shall I tell you what puzzles me most? Those cleaners we had so much trouble with. Well, presumably they're part of the organisation of Paradise Towers like your Caretakers. So why should they attack you?
And another thing. I don't know why you're so keen to kill off the Great Architect. I thought you'd be delighted to have him here to put things to rights. It doesn't make sense. Does it? (silence) I'd hate to have to live my life by some boring old rulebook like you do. You must get fed up. Well, do you?
Never?
I suppose how you guard me is in that rulebook.
I wouldn't mind having a look at that rulebook, if that's not against the rules. I mean, after all, I am a condemned man.
How extraordinary. No, no. It can't be true.
Oh no, no. It's. You couldn't possibly.
If you say so. I don't want to make a fool of you.
Oh, very well, but I find it hard to credit
It says here about a three two seven appendix three subsection nine death, that after you've been guarding the condemned prisoner for (checks his wristwatch) thirty five minutes, you must all stand up.
Yes, I know, I know, I find it extraordinary. I don't really expect you to do it. But it is in there.
The Caretakers present must then move five paces away from the prisoner.
Five. Close their eyes and put their hands above their head.
For about a minute and a half. You see, that's how long the prisoner needs.
Find the key card to the door and escape.
Find the key card to the door and escape.
Mel? Mel?
Mel?
Mel? Mel?
Nothing ventured.
Nothing gained. (He hits it and a lot of coins fall from the slot. Quickly, he uses his hat to try and collect them.)
Jackpot! Issued by the Great Architect, Kroagnon. Kroagnon?
Oh no, not you again. I've got too many things to work out. You really aren't helping. What do you want anyway? Is it my death?
Think calmly.
Oh, what's happening. I don't understand.
Oh! Build high for happiness. What happened?
I only wish I knew. Fire Escape, Bin Liner, I never expected to see you again. Still less, I didn't expect to be glad to see you again. But I've got to go. There's much to be done.
It was an accident. I was being chased by two cleaners and then suddenly
Yes. I expect they've gone by now.
Do I get the impression I'm not believed?
Oh, do they, now? Why don't you tell me about it?
What is the matter with everyone in the Towers? I simply don't understand. I mean, the Cleaners go round killing people and carting them off and no one does anything to stop them. All you Kangs can do is draw wallscrawls on the subject all over the place.
I know, I've seen them. And the Caretakers, they're no better. They allow themselves to get killed off without saying anything either. Just because there's nothing about it in their precious rulebook.
I know because I've read it.
Oh, don't tell me you don't know. I mean, what is going on? I mean, what is behind that door belching out smoke that you Kangs are so keen on painting pictures of, eh? Any ideas? Or is that simply just another mystery?
Thank goodness for that. Can I have a look?
You know, you really are very stupid for such clever people. If I were you I'd find that door and discover what's behind it. Because until you do, we're all at risk, You, Me, Mel, everybody. Are these antiques dotted around all over the building? It really is a splendid piece of auditoryarchitectatonicalmetrasyncocity.
I'm sure.
Hello? Sorry. Wrong number. Just one other thing. You probably haven't realised that this machine has another purpose.
Oh incidentally, yet another Paradise Towers mystery. Issued by the Great Architect, Kroagnon. Kroagnon? I do wish I could place him. I mean, what's happened to him since he's finished this building. No one seems to know. Sorry.
Oh, very refreshing.
Build high for happiness. But let us not forget what we have to do. We must find Mel and discover the mystery of Paradise Towers, because I've learned enough to realise that its very existence is at stake.
Not at all. You don't understand. I mean, the last people I want to meet are the Caretakers. I'm in as much danger as you. More, probably. You got to believe me. Listen, we've got to work together. The Chief Caretaker's off his head. If we don't stop the wipe-outs, who will? Please?
You must have a secret escape route. I mean, it's not like Kangs to allow themselves to be caught like rats in a trap.
But what?
I see, you need time. Well, I will buy you that time. I'm the reason why the Caretakers are here. Now, go on, make your escape. Go on. Shoo! Build high for happiness.
Greetings, Deputy Chief Caretaker. You look surprised to see me. I can't imagine why. After all, it was me you came for.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Take a look for yourself if you don't believe me.
Well?
You mean you're not certain anymore?
What makes you think I'm the Great Architect? Haven't you ever met him?
How odd.
And that would justify killing me, I mean him?
Like everyone else you seem terrified to face up to the reality of what's happening in Paradise Towers. I mean, killing me won't help you find out who's sending out those robotic Cleaners to kill people. And that's a problem that isn't going to go away, unless, of course, you're giving the orders yourself.
Perhaps. But I do have a better one.
No doubt you've been allowing the Cleaners to kill off some of your people as well as the Kangs, for reasons which are at the moment beyond me but then I'm not a power crazed psychopath.
Listen, you're going to kill me anyway so you may as well make use of my brain.
What I also think is happening is that, besides your activities, is that the Caretakers, the Kangs, Red, Yellow, Blue and everyone else are being killed off without instructions from you. And that's why you're worried. You don't know who's doing it.
I'm afraid I've got far too much to worry about, Deputy Chief Caretaker.
Please stop.
How you do. Bin Liner, Fire Escape, how did you get here?
Not at all, I'm delighted to see you. Oh, whoops.
I'm sure there are some rules to govern this, Deputy Chief.
That's the most intelligent thing he's said so far.
Well, Kangs, I must say, there's no place like home. And this is no place like home.
Oh, yes. Thank you, Fire Escape. But before we do anything else, we must view the Illustrated Prospectus. Now which pocket did I put it in?
Ah, the opening's not important, Bin Liner. Wind it on.
Miracle City!
Kroagnon was a brilliant architect, and Miracle City, his masterpiece. Only
Only he refused to move out and let anybody move in. He thought that people would destroy the beauty of his work. But they got him out. Only those who moved in lived to regret it.
Yes. Nothing could be proven so he got away with it. And as I said, he was a brilliant architect. And space is a big place, so he got other work, if course, including Paradise Towers.
Quite. And then he disappeared. Mayhaps, my dear Red Kangs, mayhaps your parents thought they were being very clever by trapping him in his own building so he wouldn't finish it. But if they did such a thing, it was very foolish. Because no matter how deep they buried him in Paradise Towers, he's bound to get out in the end.
More than that, you must tell me all you know. I mean, that door with smoke coming out of it. Where is it? Please, it's important.
And seen what?
I'm going down to the basement to find out what's going on.
Fire Escape, Bin Liner and Air Duct, you come with me. The rest stay here.
Please! Please! Please! This is no time for games. The future of Paradise Towers is at stake. We must all work together. You've got to help us. Do you understand?
Look, you've got to believe me. I'm sure the Red Kangs will agree that you've won this round of the game, but there won't be any games worth playing if we don't discover who's ordering the killings. Will you let us go to the basement?
Good. Then you will see with your own eyes what's going on.
We must hurry. What's the quickest way to get there?
Ah. Right. To the basement! Build high for happiness.
Back to the lift.
Back!
Just a moment! Please, stop! Please! The immediate danger's over. I wouldn't mind getting my breath back.
Very hot.
Now, you understand the dangerous position we're in. We must gather all the Kangs together.
As himself, yes. But you saw what happened. I mean, up to now Kroagnon's simply been a mind without a body, as your parents must have left him. However, I fear he may have spent his time down there devising a way of performing corpoelectroscopy. A way of transplanting his brilliant brain to some host body.
I can't be certain, but Kroagnon won't want to stay locked up in his basement much longer. He's bound to show himself in one form or another.
It's taking over the building floor by floor.
Is Fire Escape going to join us? Are all the Kangs here? Red? Blue?
Those who've been made unalive. Yes. Well, when Fire Escape gets here we must all make for the Great Pool in the Sky.
I'm sorry to give you such a shock, Mel, but this is where the Cleaner service lift appears to come out.
And you, Mel, and you. Er, how do you do?
Ah. I believe you've met my friends before.
The rest of the Towers would have been like this pool if he'd had his way. A killer in every corner.
Oh, very much so. But we know so little about his plans. He's had years to brood over what he wants to do, but we've no time to come up with a counter plan.
That's Paradise Towers in a nutshell, I'm afraid. The Red Kangs didn't trust the Blue Kangs, and none of them trusted the Caretakers. And the Rezzies, from your account, prey on whoever they can and trust no one either. And all of them despise poor old Pex. Oh, the Great Architect must be delighted. How are we going to unite the people of Paradise Towers to defeat him?
And you're sure that person ordering the Cleaners to do this looks like the Chief Caretaker?
Exactly. So the Great Architect has taken over his body.
Please, please, be quiet. Shush. Be quiet.
Well, you Kangs, what do you say to that?
All agreed? Pex?
Fire Escape! Shush! Pex?
We have very little time, so we must think clearly. Now Kroagnon, as we now must call the Chief Caretaker, is firmly installed in your headquarters. Am I right, Deputy Chief?
So we must find a way of getting him out again.
Precisely.
First, we must immobilise as many as we can.
Yes?
They could be described thus, yes.
We seem to be getting somewhere at last.
Please, please! We must move on to the main problem. How to persuade Kroagnon to leave his safety and come to a place of our choosing where we can trap and defeat him.
Well, there is a way that might just work.
Well, you see, Kroagnon is undoubtedly a very clever and very proud being, and like many clever and proud beings likes to be appreciated by his equals. Now, I think if he had the chance to meet such a person, he would leave his lair to do so.
I've no choice, Mel. I mean, in all honesty, I am the only obvious candidate.
Oh no, no, no. That would be extremely futile. I will allow myself to be seen, and then somebody will go to Kroagnon and offer to lead him to me. Right into our little trap. Now that person has a far more difficult and dangerous mission than I.
So be it.
Hello, there, Kroagnon. This is the Doctor speaking. I don't believe we've met, though no doubt you've heard of me. I thought so. Anyway, I'd heard so much about Paradise Towers I thought I'd come and take a look and, believe me, I'm very disappointed. It displays exactly what everyone says is your usual failure as an architect. Not making allowances for people. Still, I'm sure if we managed to work together, we might just about make this place habitable. I've a few ideas which I might give to you, if you can be bothered to listen. Bye for now.
Now, you're clear what you have to do, Pex?
Remember, Pex, you must get him out of the Caretakers Headquarters as quick as you can so that he doesn't see what's happening to the Cleaners. But then, once he's out, take as long as you can. We need time. No heroics, just a cool clear head.
Good luck, Pex.
Yes?
I'd better give them a hand. See what you can do to help the Kangs down there. Oh, and Mel, don't forget to leave the escape hatch uncovered so that I can make my exit. I just hope that Pex doesn't lose his nerve and hurry, otherwise it won't be Kroagnon who's caught in a booby trap, it'll be us.
I must tell the Doctor.
That should do it.
Oh, Pex. Move back, quickly.
There's only one way this might work, and for that I need to be on my own.
Well, now, Kroagnon, how nice of you to drop in. I am so glad. I wanted to have a few words with you about the shoddy design of this building. I mean, take this door for instance. Look at it.
Well, speaking as an expert, I'm prepared to tell the universe you couldn't design a simple doorknob. I mean, look.
Pex! Help!
Pex! Pex!
Indeed, poor Pex. But look, Mel, they're all here. The Caretakers, the Rezzies, the Kangs. This would never have happened before. Perhaps now they'll all start working together.
Ah, Fire Escape. Now, have you managed to remove the Kang wallscrawls from the Tardis as you promised?
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh, a Blue Kang or a Red Kang?
Ah, well I'll be honoured to wear it. And all my best wishes to the future of Paradise Towers.
Goodbye.
Well you never can tell.

I'm doing the very best I can, my child. Oh dear, dear, dear. It is such a worry. This poison seems to be spreading throughout the whole of his system. Yes, we need a special drug. I shall have to land somewhere.
Oh, we're slowing down, my dear. We're going to land in a moment.
Ah, well, I rather doubt it. At least, that is, we shall be stopping at a lot of places before that. Now, I want you to look after Steven, if you will, and see that you keep that wound clean. Please? That's a good girl.
I don't know my dear, but I must try. Now, I want you to stay here and look after Steven. I shall be as quick as I can.
Splendid. Now you know which switch to pull to close the doors, don't you, so I want you to do that straight away. I have my key to let myself in.
Yes. This, child. Key. This opens the door from the outside. Now go in please, and shut the door. Charming.
Ah. A city or perhaps a town. I wonder where we are? All I have to do is get through that jungle and perhaps then I can get some help. I must say it's a strange place to put a city.
What is it you want?
What key?
So, you'd use physical violence, would you? You don't know what you've let yourself in for. So you've left the key in the door! Well, well, that's the first big mistake, isn't it? Yes, very foolish. Very foolish indeed, young man. Well now, it's brain, or brawn rather, versus brain? I've got you beaten from the start, young man!
I wonder if that spaceship has anything to do with that violent young man, or any connection with that city below. Yes, there are one or two questions I must have answered.
(chuckles) I doubt that you'll be able to get out of there in a hurry, my friend.
Oh, it's a little invention of mine, I call it the magnetic chair. It has a forcefield strong enough to restrain a herd of elephants, so I wouldn't waste your energy trying to escape. You will stay there until I direct otherwise.
How is he, my dear?
Yes. Oh, by the way, I've found a city. And just as I was about to ascertain it's locale, that young ruffian set about me.
Oh yes, I hope so. Just a minute. That young man, did he say anything?
That's strange. Yes, I shall have to cross-examine him when I get back. But don't worry, he's quite safe. Our guest is quite unable to move until I press that little switch at the back. So you're quite safe. Yes, he's quite harmless. Oh, and quite comfortable, I hope?
Well, I wonder. Is this the solar system?
It's very strange.
Yes, strange indeed. Well.
Daleks!
Katarina!
Doctor. Doctor. What are you both doing here?
Yes, well, whoever this Bret is, he's quite right. The Daleks are evil things.
What? That young ruffian?
And you released him?
Girl, my Tardis, child, my Tardis. Yes, you were right. I mean, he wasn't to know that you were quite safe away from the Daleks in there. How is this young man?
Good, good, good.
I see, I see. Yes, and I clamped him in that chair, and he's the very fellow with the antitoxin. Well, young man, you'd better pull yourself together. We've got some work to do.
Aren't you feeling better?
Carefully, carefully. Now, just rest for a minute. Take a few deep breaths. Don't you try to run before you can walk, although you might have to. Oh, it's Bret, isn't it? Yes, thank you. Tell me what's happening?
Good gracious me. We must try to get back to the Tardis. We're in grave danger here.
Yes, yes, yes, possibly, possibly.
I never do and never shall.
Yes, you're quite right, my dear. It's the safest place.
Oh, not necessarily, not.
Well, in this instance, child, he might be, but I know the Daleks.
They could track us down at any time.
Oh, they were robots.
These are Daleks. Now you listen to me, young man, I am in charge of this situation.
Well upon my soul.
Yes, and you will have to do far more than that. If the Daleks are doing something drastic, then we have to stop the Daleks. Now will you shut up, sir?
We know, young man.
Now just listen, listen, listen. Think back for a moment. Just think back. If the Daleks were going to attack Earth, as you seem to fear, then you must tell Earth to look back in the history of the year 2157, and that the Daleks are going to attack again. History will show how to deal with them.
Now listen
Yes, yes, you're quite right, young man. They're going to trap us.
Oh, no, no, no. Not quite, not quite, my dear. We've got to get out of here. Come on. This way.
But of course. That's the last place they will expect us to go. Come along.
You know that spaceship?
Oh, then you'll know how to fly it?
Well, that's the one to go for, isn't it?
Will you both be quiet, please! We're going to take that spaceship if we're going to warn Earth.
Well, obvious or not, my boy, it's quite obvious he's one of the representatives.
No, no. Not yet, not yet. Not until we find out exactly what the Daleks are planning, and this may be our only chance.
I'm going to that conference.
Why not? If I wear his cloak, why not?
Oh, nonsense. You three can take over the spaceship, and I can join you later.
Oh yes, now don't worry, my child, don't worry.
I found this, and I don't know whether it's relevant or not, but hold onto it safely.
Oh, in the jungle. Now I want you, I want you to give me enough time to get to that meeting and find out exactly what's going on. Then I will head back to Chen's spaceship.
Well, I must leave that to your own judgment. If, of course, you hear any kind of uproar, well then you'll have to get into the spaceship and go off without me.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense. Earth must be warned about the Daleks and about Chen.
Rubbish. Rubbish, my boy. I'm only doing what has to be done. Now come on, help me on with this cloak. Be quick about it. Come along.
Get us off, Bret! Get us off! Get us off! Take off, man.
That was rather violent acceleration, young man.
Well done, Bret, Well done. You got us off very well.
Of course I was. You're far too pessimistic. Now, where's that little box of mine?
Yes. Ah, splendid, splendid. The Daleks' plans are utterly useless without this.
They've allied themselves with the rulers of the outer galaxies to take over the Universe.
Yes, their first objective being Earth and then the solar system.
Oh, he's one of them, my friend. By sacrificing the Solar System, he hopes to gain more power.
Oh no it isn't, no it isn't! Therefore we must get to Earth before him.
Yes, I know, my dear, but this is not Earth as we see it. Effectively it's something very different.
Well, as I said before my boy, the Daleks' plans are utterly useless without this.
Tut, tut, tut. Don't open it, please.
It will burn your eyes. You'll go totally blind! That is a full emm of taranium.
Taranium.
Fifty years, to be precise, and Mavic Chen has given this to the Daleks to complete one of the most evil weapons ever devised. Their Time Destructor.
Yes, the rarest mineral in the universe.
Oh, don't complain, young man. You're a very privileged person. Do you realise very few people have seen this in this universe.
Well, for the moment, nothing.
We have the taranium, so for the moment we do nothing. And by doing nothing, we do everything. Do I make myself clear?
Oh my dear young man, you ask so many questions. Look at Katarina over there. She doesn't ask questions, she just looks and learns. Now, why don't you try the same thing? You know I find all this extremely fascinating. It's a little primitive of course, but it's still very fascinating.
Yes. Bret, can you find me something to play magnetic tape?
Well my dear fellow, that's magnificent. It's all so convenient, isn't it. I'll play that tape that I gave you before I went to the Daleks' conference?
Oh, I found a small tape beside a skeleton and it might be able to tell us something. Katarina! Come over here, my child. Now, have a look at another wonder.
No, my dear, no.
No, no, no. Bret here was searching for someone and the skeleton I found was humanoid. Well, whoever it was may learned something that we haven't.
Well, did you search that pairing twice?
Well, it so happens that kind of jungle is apt to lead you back to the same place more than once.
Oh yes no doubt you were and I suppose I was lucky. Now play the tape. Come along, come along, stop all this talking.
But we must. The Daleks will stop at anything to prevent us.
Yes, yes, you must find someone who you can trust. Someone in a high enough position that may be able to help.
We're changing course.
You know I believe we're approaching the gravitation point of that planet.
Has it any kind of atmosphere?
Well, if it's one of your prison planets, surely there are guards and warders there to help us.
You must try to land softly somewhere.
Yes, I'm afraid I do, only too well.
You're quite right, my boy.
Yes, it means that they coming after us again.
Now, you sure you've got spare parts for this?
It's the worse of these out-of-date and primitive spaceships. One little bump and they all fall to bits.
Oh yes, quite so. That's why we are stranded on this pimple of a planet, whilst you footle with that fuse box.
Now, you listen to me, young man. Don't you start to criticise my Tardis. And as for space travel, you're still wet behind the ears. Oh, do get on with it both of you.
What are you doing out here, child? I thought I told you to keep these doors closed.
Good gracious, so there are. Two. No, three. Yes, we must get on with the repairs to the ship and get away from here. Yes, those men will be vicious out there. We're liable to come under attack. That's marshy ground. Very interesting. Very interesting. Interesting.
Oh, thank you, my dear. Where is your cactic power, rather, outlet?
Cactic outlet?
Where?
Oh, yes. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Come here, my dear. No, round this way, child. Now, do you see that switch? I'll tell you when to pull it.
Oh, don't ask questions, my dear girl, otherwise you'll become like the other two. Just do as you're told.
Now then. That should repel any boarders.
Yes, I think you're right, my dear. Now you go in and stand by that switch. Wait until I'll give you an order.
Now!
Oh you two go back in there and get on with your repairs. Katarina and I are trying to repel any type of boarders.
But of course not. But it will knock them unconscious. Now just you remember, young man, I have no desire to kill anyone. Now go in there and get on with those repairs. I want to leave this place quickly. Hurry up please. Wasting my time. Well I think that should do the trick, my dear. Come along, let's get this cable back. There we are.
I hope so, my dear, I hope so.
It's the Dalek Spaceship! It's bound to land. Hurry up!
Get off, get off, get off!
Oh I'm so sorry, I'm not used to this kind of craft.
Look! Look! The Daleks' ship made a bad landing. That gives us the time we need.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that, young man. Now, you got some thinking to do. Katarina, check up on that door and see that it is secure.
Remember, Chen will have allies on earth and
Who are you? What do you want? Release that girl!
Kembel!
The Daleks are no help, We're going back to Earth.
We're changing course. Now release that girl.
The girl will be dead before the door's half open! Can we talk to him in there?
Let's try a little bluff. Now, then! Listen to me, whoever you are. Bring that girl in here, or we will press a button and you will go outside the door into space.
We've got to get Katarina out of there!
Change course!
Take him back to Kembel. Take him back to Kembel! Let the Daleks deal with him.
Don't worry, dear boy, We'll find a way out.
She may have wanted to, dear boy. She wanted to save our lives.
I hope she's reached her Place of Perfection.
She didn't understand. She couldn't understand. She wanted to save our lives and perhaps the lives of all the other beings of the Solar System. I hope she's found her Perfection. Oh, how I shall always remember her as one of the Daughters of the Gods. Yes, as one of the Daughters of the Gods.
Judging by the position of those planets, we shall land quite soon.
Oh, haven't we sufficient powerdrive to land safely?
Yes, you've got a point there. Where can we land?
But can we land?
Yes, I heard that. Now, don't concern yourselves over me. I can look after myself. The most important factor is this taranium.
And I think we're just wasting valuable time sitting about here waiting for this man, Baxter or Daxtor or whatever he call himself.
Surely everyone must know that Chen's space-ship has crash-landed only a short distance away from here. There must be hundreds of people looking for us!
But this is an experimental plant, There's no scientists, no staff, nobody! We might just as well have landed ourselves on an empty planet. What on Earth is happening?
Has it occurred to you, by any chance, that we might have deliberately walked into an ambush?
Quite true. And then he gave a rather pompous speech of self-satisfaction and handed over the core of the Time Destructor to the Daleks.
A lust for more power than he already has. Universal power.
Yes, quite so. So whatever plans you have, it's essential that Steven and I return to the planet Kembel. I want to recover something of unique value.
No.
I suggest you ask Daxtar what he is playing at.
What price is Mavic Chen paying you for your treachery?
Long acquaintance is no guarantee for honesty. Ask him. Ask him how he came to know that the core of their Time Destructor was taranium!
I did not, sir. How long have you been in this conspiracy?
There is you, and Chen, and how many of the others? Or what others are involved?
You brainless idiot! How many times have I told you about taking lives? We have other ways and means of dealing with evil doers.
Possibly! But now we shall never know whom we can trust!
And how do you propose to do that?
Yes, possibly. We filled in the story long before he gave himself away.
Yes, possible. If you hadn't killed Daxtar of course there wouldn't be any need to.
Well, there's not much point in standing here discussing it any longer. We shall have to try out your scheme, though I very much doubt of any sort of success that he might have.
Where's Bret?
Oh, he's an irritating man. Come along. In here, quickly.
Now I wonder what that is?
Yes, it could be some kind of transmitter.
Well, I suggest you stay at that door, and if you hear any noise outside it's bound to be him.
Mice. Yes. Perhaps it's some kind of experiment.
Let me speak, please.
The mice couldn't have done that.
How extraordinary. Most extraordinary. Steven! Steven, my boy, where are you?
All right, all right, all right.
Calm down, calm down. I don't know where we are. We're safe and sound, that's the main thing. Oh, I suppose she had to come along.
Yes, I'm very glad you took that gun away from her. Is she all right?
Pull yourself together, madam. I want to ask you a few questions.
Take a good look round, dear boy, and find a place to hide. We've a lot to sort out.
Quiet. Do as you're told. Get on your feet. You're lucky to be alive. Now, you come with me, but don't try any tricks. Come along.
Getting away from this place sets quite a problem.
At the moment, I haven't the faintest idea.
Cellular dissemination.
To put it in lay language, cellular dissemination means our bodies were broken up by some process or other, shot through into the fourth dimension, and at a given point, reassembled again on this planet.
Fantastic it may be my boy, but impossible, no, because precisely that is what has happened.
Yes, that followed along too and I believe it's sending messages back to Earth. Now that would mean that Mavic Chen will know precisely where we are. Therefore the Daleks will attack once again.
I might have know it. Visians. The planet Mira.
I'm afraid it is, my dear.
Leave her, my boy. There's nothing we can do. She finally believes us.
Steven! Listen to me, both of you. This is the planet Mira, and the only beings on here are the Visians. We can't see them, but they're very vicious. We must try to get away from here as soon as possible.
I don't know yet.
Yes, and it appears we're trapped!
I don't think they've quite fathomed us out.
And you remember, my boy, aim high. These Visians are eight feet tall.
I'm afraid, my friends, the Daleks have won.
If I do, what guarantee is there that you won't fire your guns afterwards?
You dare not fire, because of this taranium! To end this stalemate, may I suggest
There's a good boy, keep going!
There's only one guard. Now you know what to do?
I certainly will. I've come to give myself up.
I have. I realise of course that I am no match for the Daleks, so if I hand it over, will you help me and my friends to get away from this planet?
Oh, they will come when I call them. The taranium. Shall I give it to you or would you prefer me to hand it to you in your ship?
Escape! Oh, my tin friend. Never. You mustn't forget that I came here and surrendered of my own free will.
Oh don't worry my dear. I'm quite accustomed to this Dalek technique. Close the hatches please.
The power build-up is far too slow. Feed in that extra energy.
It should activate at five, zero, zero.
Splendid!
Autogiro. Giro dynamo.
Discharge.
Splendid! Hold tight!
No, course it won't, my dear boy. That's the whole point.
No, we shall have to make a copy. A copy so exact that we can deceive the Daleks. They'll still want this taranium back, you know. They won't rest until they get it.
Yes, thank you, thank you my dear, thank you. I'll have a good try. And I think that will give us sufficient breathing space. What's that?
Good gracious, we're on the course for the planet Kembel. You know, I'm very much afraid that we're under the Dalek influence.
Yes, of course there is, my dear boy. Of course there is. Come along, young lady, let's get on with our mineral while we still have the time.
Yes I think so, yes, yes, there. That's a good copy, although I say it myself.
I appreciate that young lady, but this is the right balance and the right weight.
Oh good, good, good. Well you keep watching, there's a good fellow.
No, I should try that one.
Isn't it.
Oh, we're working on that. Yes, we're working on it.
Too primitive, my boy. Too primitive and far too dangerous.
Back to the planet Kembel but what? You know, it appears that we're being affected by magnetization. We're been held in a very strong beam.
Let's try and break it, child. Come along.
My dear boy! What happened? What's happened? He's still breathing.
He's still alive, and lucky at that.
Oh, isn't that wonderful. That's wonderful! Steven's theory has proved successful. But what about the poor boy?
Yes, we should be landing in about five minutes.
No, my dear. He's adapting to it. Can you talk, my boy? No. He's still under the influence of that force field. Nothing further will happen to you. Now don't worry.
Yes, nothing further going to happen to him but I must confess I I have no cure for that condition.
Yes, yes, I'm afraid so. Sara, bring me that fake taranium. Yes, yes, yes. Now, listen to me, Steven. Try and understand. This is very important so you must trust me. You do understand? Just try and indicate.
We're here. Now we've got to face the Daleks. Open the doors, please. Steven will lead the way. This way, Steven.
It's our only chance, my dear. And remember, I will do all the talking.
No. And remember, you cannot fire because of the taranium. You'd have another fifty years work.
I will hand over the taranium outside my ship, the Tardis.
Outside my ship, the Tardis, or nowhere!
Thank you. Steven?
Sara, open the door please. The young man will give you the taranium when the girl and I are safely inside my ship, the Tardis.
Remember to do exactly as I say, Steven. I will give you further instructions from inside my Tardis.
Steven, hand the box over to Chen. Then come inside the Tardis.
The Dalek guns must have destroyed that forcefield completely. It's a good thing they didn't fire a second time.
You had a shield round you. You know, similar to that one that protects the Tardis. Oh, that's remind me. Where is that genuine Taranium?
Certainly not! What you did was very dangerous and extremely stupid.
One more experiment like that and you really will be dead.
Now, now, now, you listen to me, young man. I warned you it was dangerous before you tried it. You might have killed yourself and blown up the space-ship. Then, where would we all be?
Now, now, now, now don't be cheeky.
I don't care what you think. We're not going to repeat it. Why do you think science turned down your discovery? Because it isn't safe. So perhaps in future you'll pay attention to what I say and remember that I happen to be the leader of this expedition and I don't want to keep on repeating myself.
Never mind the buts! If you don't like it, you can get off!
I hope not.
What's the matter?
Oh, tut, tut, tut. That scanner's not working.
Yes I shall have to repair it, of course, yes, yes, but that means checking up on the whole circuit.
Ah, ah, ah. Don't you dare touch that.
Well, just look at those dials. Look! Look here, Sara. You see those dials, now you know what that means? If either of you went outside, it would be extremely dangerous. The whole atmosphere is entirely poisonous.
Will neither of you understand?
No! Where you come from, in both places, the air is pure. Outside there is the worst kind of pollution I've met in years.
Ah, my dear boy, I'm used to all sorts of atmospheres. It won't affect me. I shall have to go out and do the repairing myself.
Then, and only then, can you come out. But you must be very, very careful.
My dear young man, just give me a few minutes and if all is well, I shall be back inside again to tell you.
Now, look here, my boy. You will do as you're told! Now you just open the doors and remember to close them after I've gone.
Good evening.
No, police. P-O-L-I-C-E.
Oh, nonsense, child. We're back on Earth.
Oh, never mind. Never mind. I shall have to go outside and try and distract them. Meanwhile, you can stay here for a while then come out and do the scanner.
Never mind what I said, my dear boy. Do as you're told. Now open the doors and remember to shut them after I've gone.
Hmm.
(to the man) Haven't I seen your face before somewhere?
Yes, of course, I remember now, yes. The marketplace at Jaffa.
Oh, Christmas. Oh, is it? Of course. Yes, yes, yes, yes. That accounts for the holly in the hall.
Well, of course I didn't know. I travel about too much.
Well, a quest of knowledge, dear boy. I mean, you have a saying in this country, have you not? Travel broadens the mind?
No. Gracious, no.
No.
Oh, you'll have to think in a far bigger way than that. Your ideas are too narrow, too small, too crippled.
Well, I suppose you might say that I am a citizen of the universe, and a gentleman to boot.
I don't think you really understand. That object in the yard out there isn't really a police box.
It is a machine for investigating Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.
Do I take it that you gentlemen are imputing that I am mentally deranged?
Of course, of course. And what are you doing here?
Enough of the old man either. What's all this funny accent?
Well, even I, dear boy, must admit that I enjoyed myself. Did you fix the scanner?
Oh.
Have you checked it?
Never mind, never mind. Is the taranium safe?
Now, that's one thing you mustn't do, my dear. Remember, they have the same type of machines and they can follow us.
No, I sincerely hope not.
I don't think the Daleks will attack the Solar System until they've checked their Time Destructor.
Well, I think we might, perhaps, be able to destroy the taranium before they catch us up.
Yes, we might, we might still be on Earth. Wait a minute.
Oh, no. The atmosphere has improved considerably. Yes, let's have a look at the scanner. It might tell us something.
The door!
Where's Sara?
In here quick.
No, I must find Sara.
I'll try out there first. You wait here.
Hmm?
Certainly, certainly. My help? Oh, I shall be delighted. Yes. (speaks arabic).
Doctor, please.
Oh, yes. And who is this?
Nonsense! You put some more clothes on, child. Go along. And what's all this?
Come on. To the wardrobe. The wardrobe.
Now, come along. We must go back to the Tardis. This is a madhouse. It's all full of Arabs. Come along.
Come back, you two!
What's that?
Aren't there? Well, that's a joke in itself.
Quite, quite. Now would you mind moving
All done by Chaplin.
Done by Chaplin.
Now would you excuse me?
Yes.
Custard pies and Bing Crosby! Ha!
Here we are.
Well, we so rarely get a chance to celebrate, but this time we must.
Yes. It's Christmas.
Don't you remember? The police station? Christmas?
Here's a toast. A Happy Christmas to all of us.
(direct to camera) Incidentally, a Happy Christmas to all of you at home!
My dear, this machine can only tell us we're being followed, ,ot who by.
Yes, a hasty conclusion, but possibly right. Although I don't understand how they could have tested that taranium so quickly.
Oh, nonsense, my dear.
Yes, yes.
Pretty soon, my dear, pretty soon.
I know full well what I'm doing, child. Now don't get so excited.
Hmm? Yes, I see. Yes, I must do something drastic.
Landing, my dear. That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Yes, it's definitely some sporting occasion.
Oh, possibly, my dear fellow, possibly.
Yes, my plan hasn't worked. Following us closely.
No, we must take off quite soon.
No, my boy, we haven't shaken them off. Whoever it was following us has landed. They've landed out there.
My dear young girl, what good would it be to run away? The sooner we find who's pursuing us the better.
Yes, well, I can well imagine that. This is a new planet, my boy. It's cooling down, cooling down. Fascinating. Yes, extremely fascinating. I wonder? I wonder who'd take the time and trouble to follow us? Yes, I think there is an explanation, but unlikely. Possible, very possible.
Hello there! Hello! Don't you think we should meet and talk it over?
Oh, you'll see, my boy, you'll see.
You lack one quality of all the others, my boy, and that is patience.
Ah, tut, tut, tut, my dear Monk. Now don't be so ridiculous. Put that down at once.
Oh, no complaints, no. And you?
I suppose congratulations for your escape are quite in order.
Yes, a very interesting solution, yes, I'm sure, though I think it would make for rather an uncomfortable ride. However, I don't suppose it affected you very much, being an amateur.
Yes, I suppose so.
And you returned here for one obvious reason, did you not?
Yes, yes, quite, quite. Tell me, any plans?
Don't waste your breath, young man. The most important thing is, is to find out what he's done to the Tardis. Come on.
Reset the lock mechanism. He probably used some kind of ray.
That means we cannot get back into the Tardis, child!
Oh, you will achieve nothing, dear boy, nothing.
Yes, like I am, I suppose?
Oh, and why not, dear boy, why not? Because I am using my brain. I'm trying to solve this problem.
Now just stand back and cover your eyes, please.
Perhaps nothing, perhaps everything. Will you do as you're told at once. Cover your eyes, please.
Wait a moment, child.
Now try.
Yes, I know, my boy. I know.
Quite so, dear boy. He'll be on our trail again as fast as he can get going.
Exactly, my dear, exactly. Now, Steven, there's something I want you to do. Go to that indicator and let me know the instant the Monk's Tardis registers.
Oh, that's all very simple, dear boy. You see the sun in that particular galaxy has very unusual powers. I merely reflected its powers through that ring.
Yes, it has certain properties. The combined forces of that sun together with the stone in that ring was sufficient enough to correct the Monk's interference.
Now, I don't want to discuss this anymore. Please, about turn, and do as you're told. Go along.
No.
I don't quite know, you just listen, my dear, listen.
It's Earth. I've seen that place before.
Well, as far as I can remember, I've seen them behave in a fashion like that on a former occasion.
The Relief of Mafeking.
Well, it's hard to say, my boy, but I think that its going to be a little more difficult than I thought.
Yes, but I don't think so for much longer. It's about time you know that that wretched Monk landed and I think he will quite soon.
Well, yes, the pyramids are the seventh wonder of this ancient world, I should say the word impressive is rather an understatement.
Would you mind passing me the diatrab, dear boy, please.
I said the diatrab. I said the diatrab.
Yes, I think perhaps it would be a good idea if you keep your eye on the Monk, so if you climb higher. Talking to myself.
Calm down. Calm down. What's all the fuss? Is that you bawling your head off?
Now that's very good. Yes, very good. Now, please excuse me.
Oh, my dear young man, I have no intention of leaving the Tardis unlocked. And another thing you should know. Do you realise I had to strip the whole of this mechanism down before I could put it right.
Oh, I don't know. But anyway I dare say I can catch you up somewhere. But be careful. You know that Monk can be very harmful if he wants to.
Well, that's finished. Now I must go. I wonder where those other two are now. Sara? Steven?
Who was it landed here before, then? The Daleks!
Good heavens. You're given an opportunity you didn't before.
You're wasting your time. You won't get in.
For a time, yes, for a time. I've been glad to. You know, I don't think I would have found my Tardis without the help of that energy counter.
Yes, like your machine, I suppose.
Well, you know, my way has its advantages. The Egyptians thought it was a very good idea, otherwise they wouldn't have brought it in here. As for your machine, well, it's probably disguised as a what, a sort of a block of stone?
Not your machine, no. I didn't realise it at the time.
Really?
And then you would be able to see the taranium, too.
Warn me?
Why didn't you?
Warn me.
You know, I think before I go, I should put you safely out of the way.
I did.
If you believe that, my friend, you will believe anything!
All right, I'm here. Tell me what you want me to do.
I am here. Can you hear me?
Where are they?
Where are they!
Very well, I will hand over the taranium core.
But on my terms.
No escort, and on my terms.
Yes, indeed. Indeed you could, but then you'd never get back the taranium core, would you now, hmm? Would you?
You will release your prisoners. I also include that Monk fellow too, though I don't know why I should bother with him. Bring all three to the place of rendezvous, and hand them over at the same time.
You should know the answer to that as well as I do. None of you can be trusted. You and one Dalek, at the west angle of the Great Pyramid.
Stay where you are. You will move when I tell you to.
Mavic Chen, walk towards me. Dalek, halt! Mavic Chen, you have disregard my conditions. I said one Dalek.
Before we go any further, you will release your hostages. Then, and only then, will I hand you the taranium core.
Away, all of you. Mavic Chen, join me at the back here. I am now about to hand over the taranium core to Mavic Chen. Follow me.
I'm afraid not, young man.
I had to hand the real taranium core over to Mavic Chen. I know I should have tried to get him but it was hopeless. There was so much chaos going on, and now it's too late.
Except this.
That is the directional unit from the Monk's Tardis.
Perhaps, perhaps.
Yes, I suppose it is. But that isn't all, my dear.
I think not, dear boy. I had to take precautionary measures in case my plans didn't work. Now whilst I was collecting that unit, I changed the Monk's Tardis into a police telephone box.
Yes, yes, exactly like mine. Well of course the Daleks will be on our track but I think, should my plan succeed, they will find the Monk.
I don't care if he's in Timbuktu.
Oh, I shouldn't worry any more, my dear boy. There's no doubt about it, he's right away by now.
Perhaps, yes. Perhaps one day. At the moment, I should say that he's had quite enough for us for a while. Having taken his directional unit, it will take him quite a time to make the necessary repairs to his ship.
Well, I'm not certain. It's a Mark four, remember. There are two possibilities. One, it would work.
Number two, the increased energy rate will certainly destroy the centre column.
Yes, my dear. A chance. A slim one.
There we are. That's finished. It's a pity we haven't got a more reliable way of testing it.
Oh yes, it is finished, my dear. But, er.
Yes. You realise, of course, we're taking a terrible chance.
Very well, my boy. Pull the main switch.
Well, fortunately there's no damage done to the control panel itself.
Oh, that's useless, dear boy, useless. Take a look for yourself.
Well, the unit required a much higher energy rate then we possess.
A built-in safety measure, my dear. You see, the excess energy must have forced itself back into the directional unit and that means that our plans to return to Kembel have failed.
Yes, and there's nothing that we can do about it.
Well, our only chance, my dear, is to try and capture the Monk's time machine or that of the Daleks.
Have patience, dear boy. It's highly probable they've all left by now, and I should think there's one or two of those Egyptians around. Let's take a look on the scanner.
Yes, it's vaguely familiar. It might be Kembel. Do you know that means that that directional unit must have burned itself out after we'd dematerialised. I wonder if you'd bring that er, that impulse compass.
Well, now, young lady? Perhaps you'll have more faith in me in the future. I thought something would work out.
Oh, nonsense, nonsense.
Of course it was.
Yes, well, perhaps, perhaps. Anyway, now we're here I think we'd better make a plan.
I've no idea. Though I think we might be able to make it on foot. Perhaps I'd better go out and take some bearings. Open the door, dear boy.
Don't say anything. Just do what I tell you. Take that.
Yes. Now, when I tell you, I want you to take Sara back to the Tardis. You still have that power impulse compass?
Good. Now follow bearing 627 to the Tardis.
Shush. There is no use in all of us taking risks. You must do as I say.
I followed a Dalek here, of course. Now let me get on. I am going to activate the time destructor.
Ah ha, that's it.
I am afraid you're too late. The time destructor is activated.
No, you cannot fire, can you? You dare not. If you were to, yes, you could kill us, but you would totally destroy your equipment. I think it is checkmate. Send one of your Daleks over here. Remember, the time destructor is working, working slowly, but if you disobey me, I can accelerate it!
Turn about. You two, behind it. Steven, take my stick and clamp it down on his gun. Forward!
Now, both of you, back to the Tardis.
Do as I say, quickly!
What are you doing here?
You must remember, my child, this machine is working. It's working slowly because its range is rather small at the moment, but it is working. Now, if you start to feel strange, you must let me know at once.
First, back to the Tardis. Is Steven not with you?
Hurry, my child, hurry!
My dear, are you beginning to feel strange?
Yes, well, perhaps it's this time destructor having an effect on the elements.
No, no, that's impossible, my dear. There's one thing I do know about this machine. It will continue until the taranium has finally burnt itself out. Our only chance is to get back to the Tardis. Then I can neutralise it.
It's not far now. Sara!
The time destructor is
No, don't touch me.
You must get back to the ship! Go forward.
Close the door. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, Steven. By chance, you reversed the time destructor. Instead of time rushing forward, it's now racing back. Sara? You realise she came to look for me, to see if I was all right?
The Daleks!
Oh, dust. Nothing but dust!
Mavic Chen's taranium core has finally burnt itself out.
Yes, my boy, so do I. You know, Steven, the one thing that Sara lived for was to see the total destruction of the Daleks. Well, now it's all over. Without her help, this could never have been achieved.
Millions of years of progress reversed back.
That's all that remains of a Dalek.
Well, my boy, we finally rid this planet of Daleks.
What a waste. What a terrible waste.

Rook to bishop's four.
I saw Capablanca make that move against Alekhine in 1927.
Who?
Are you sure?
I must have been called away. Are you really sure?
King to knight's two. King? That's a terrible move. You've weakened the king's side.
I know, I know. I'll check your programming sometime. We're not supposed to be playing draughts, you know.
Shush. We're playing chess.
I don't think so.
Oh, that old thing.
Shush.
If you must.
I just feel I deserve a little break. After all, we've got half the segments. I prefer to play chess.
Mate in eleven? Oh yes, oh yes. Well, that's the trouble with chess, isn't it. It's all so predictable.
Hmm?
Mate in eleven? What, have we arrived? Oh good. Where?
Tara?
Ah. Peaceful looking place. That shouldn't give you too much trouble.
I think it's rather beautiful, don't you? Very good for. Yes, I think it would be.
Shouldn't you be getting changed?
Well, it's in here somewhere.
Aha! Aha! Goody. Gosh, that takes me back.
Or forward. That's the trouble with time travel, you can never remember.
Last time I used this, I was with Isaak Walton. Yes. Yes, it's all here.
Aha.
Fishing.
Fishing? It's an art, worthy of the knowledge and practise of a wise man. Isaak Walton
You find it. I'm taking the day off.
Yes. After a journey of four hundred years and twelve parsecs, I'm allowed a rest of fifty years.
Section ninety three, paragraph two, laws governing Time Lords. You look it up. Go on.
Well, of course not. I'd get bored. I just propose to spend the next couple of hours fishing.
You get it.
Yes, you do that. It's a lovely day, beautiful countryside. The walk will do you good.
Would you just mind standing aside, please? You're casting a shadow. It frightens the fish.
Yes.
Do you mind not standing on my chest? My hat's on fire. I don't think we've met before.
Hmm?
Call me Doctor.
Oh, fishing.
What? Prince Reynart?
I've never heard of him. Decent sort of chap, is he?
No, no, that won't be necessary.
Good heavens, electrically charged. The control's in the hilt, I see.
Well, I've travelled.
A little.
Well, of course not. I've travelled.
What? What did you just say?
I thought you said an android. What's wrong with it?
Why don't you just try your local android dealer?
Look, that isn't necessary. You see, I'd really love to help you out but I'm frightfully busy and where is this android?
Ahem, you're standing on my scarf.
If you don't stop burning my scarf, you're going to have to kill me.
Perhaps he does
Well, maybe he does get too enthusiastic in the course of his duty. What about my scarf?
I told you, I'm not a peasant.
Well, that depends.
No.
One thousand gold pieces? Pfft. Do you think you can buy me for money? Ha! Five hundred.
Suppose I can't mend the android?
Thank you.
Oh yes, yes. Where? Excuse me.
That's not bad. I have seen better.
Well, that depends. Fixed for what?
Why?
Well, congratulations.
Why? What's to stop you?
What?
So?
Ah. And that's when Grendel of Gracht steps in?
Where does George come into all this?
Ah, I see. Let them attack George here instead of the Prince.
And draw their fire.
Well, it has been done before.
Well, it'll do for now, but if I'd had the proper tools I could have done a much better job.
My pleasure.
No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm otherwise engaged.
All right.
You look better without your helmet.
To the King.
Thank you.
Potent stuff.
So much for the local wine.
What?
What?
Haven't you got anything better to do?
What's that?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What? Where?
By whom?
But I don't even know who Count Grendel is!
Well at least he didn't take the android.
Well, that depends on what you're going to do.
And what's that?
What? What, just the two of you?
Then he's an idiot. Listen, let me see if I understand this. In order to be crowned King, the Prince must present himself in the Coronation room at a specific time, right?
Then you've got no problem. Excuse me.
You take it to the Coronation room and get it crowned.
Would you rather crown Count Grendel of Gracht?
Well, I don't suppose the King was going to walk in through the front door, was he?
Ah. What?
Aha, I thought there might be something like that. How secret? Would Grendel know about it?
So do I. Right, now listen. I'll do some more work on George, you get him to the Coronation room, get him crowned, and while he's ruling the country you two can find the real Prince. I mean, that's worth a try, isn't it?
Only two?
Ah, well, I can't guarantee you anything, but if I had the proper tools
Security? But only the three of us need even know of George's existence.
And by the time George is King, I'll be light years away.
Now look here, Zadek. I've got better things to do than meddle in the politics of your piffling little planet.
On the other hand, I could be with the android at all times.
Calling my dog.
Well, of course not. He hasn't arrived yet.
Well, as far as I can without the proper tools.
No. His micro-circuitry's not perfect and his power packs need a boost.
I'm deeply touched.
Don't draw that sword.
That thing? That's my dog.
Well, so is your Prince.
Don't draw that sword!
K9? K9?
Look, I don't like to say I told you so, but I told you so. Do put it away, quickly. K9, where's Romana?
What? Where is she?
But she was only meant to be gone an hour.
Yes, my assistant. She was looking for something.
Oh, nothing important.
Where you picked me up yesterday.
Up the hill.
Where is Count Grendel's castle?
Eight leagues.
Well, where else might he have taken her if not there?
Right. K9, you take the castle. I'll go to Tara with George.
Well, of course. Anyway, we need Zadek to get us into the palace, right?
K9, off you go. Find out if Romana's there and report straight back to me. Come on, off you go.
What?
Oh, well, if she's there, he'll find her.
Good.
Who is.
Yes, I think so.
Well, I've switched off his communication mechanism to conserve power.
Don't worry, he'll make a speech. Don't worry. It won't be a long one, but he'll make a speech.
Funny thing, some androids feel like that about humans.
Will he recover?
Good.
It fires electronic bolts. How very quaint.
What were these tunnels built for?
Ah.
I see. Very far yet?
What? Stop him!
Let's hope so. Off you go.
It can't have been moved for two hundred years. It's stuck! It won't move.
(sotto) I'll do some more work on his speech circuits.
Romana?
No!
A circuit must have been faulty. I heard it spark.
To get close enough to kill him.
Ah.
Ahem. His Majesty is very tired. Can't you talk about this tomorrow?
I'm the King's Doctor.
No, nothing a nice rest won't cure. He'll be all right tomorrow.
What possible danger can His Majesty be in from his own personal bodyguard, Count?
Not unless I can recharge his power packs and repair his speech circuits.
K9.
Are you sure?
Good. Well, that means the Count has Romana, the real Princess and the Prince.
No, I wouldn't say that. We've still got a prince of sorts.
Well, K9, what would happen if I connect the carbon circuit to the silicon circuit? How long would they last?
Come on.
Go on, ask him a question. Go on.
Zadek.
Intelligent than the real one? Well, of course he is. I programmed him.
It's funny, you know. That's what some androids say about people.
Anyway, how can you possibly be frightened of something that goes pfft if it short-circuits?
Ah.
Quite right, too. Quite right. We peasants have got to stick together. Now then, what can I do for you, huh?
Lamia?
Well?
Why?
Shush. Come over here.
Lamia's offered us a deal.
Romana in exchange for the safe conduct out of the country of Count Grendel.
No, no, I accepted. I'm to take a written undertaking from you and the King for Grendel's safety, then Lamia and her friends will pass Romana over to me.
Yes, I can.
At a place called the Pavilion of the Summer Winds. Do you know where it is?
Good. I shall have to go alone, of course. It's funny, they always want you to go alone when you're walking into a trap. Have you noticed that?
Hello, Romana. How are you?
Shush. Steady, K9, steady. Let's take a look.
Hello. You're early.
Yes. Madame Lamia, is it?
Yes, but I had nothing better to do so I thought I'd come early. What's your reason?
No, but it would have been fun to hear it. Where's Romana?
I do indeed. Safe conduct for Count Grendel in return for Romana, also safe and sound.
Where is Romana? You realise, of course, that Count Grendel will have to go into exile, but there's no reason then why you can't go into exile with him, is there? Where's Romana?
You bring her in. It's a good offer, Lamia. A fair offer.
What is it, K9?
In focus, K9?
Now!
What? You just leave it to me, K9. I know exactly what I'm doing.
Liar!
It's time we got out of here, isn't it, K9.
Around here, do you think?
Come on!
Everyone for himself, K9!
I hope you know how to stop this thing when we get there.
Isn't it?
Yes. We call him George.
Oh, they're real, I think.
(at the door) Horseman approaching.
Nothing that can't be fixed, Count.
Yes, well, so was I.
Me?
Well?
I am?
I am?
I don't know. Go on, you tell me.
What would happen?
What?
What's the answer?
What? What would that achieve?
Ah. You, I suppose?
Me? Just a moment.
The Count's just offered me the throne.
Because he's got Romana. Look!
He'll be halfway to Castle Gracht by now.
How long do you think the siege will last, Zadek?
Two years? Well, we haven't got two years before Grendel kills both the King and Romana. Anyway, looking at that plan, I'd say there's only one way into the castle.
If someone on the inside opens the main gate and a group of our men, under cover of darkness, take the guard by surprise.
Me.
No, no. One man and his dog. Come on, K9.
All right, K9, let's go.
Good.
Don't worry.
Don't worry, we'll manage. You just make sure you're all ready to charge in the moment those gates are open.
Yes?
Too complicated for me.
Good.
Here we are, K9. Here we are. This must be it.
Shush. Quiet. Just start cutting.
Hear that, K9? Wedding bells or a funeral knell? Do hurry up. A hamster with a blunt penknife would do it quicker.
Just get on with it.
About time, too.
Good.
You all right? Now listen, there's bound to be lots of stairs in there. You stay here and keep an eye on the boat. I might have to bring the others out this way if anything goes wrong.
And don't fall in the water.
You old sea dog, you. Now don't forget, stand guard and be careful. Be careful!
Shush!
No!
No, she doesn't. Hello, everyone. Sorry I'm late. If there's something I always enjoy, it's a good wedding, isn't that true, Romana? (to the Archimandrite) Now, listen. Have you got to the bit where you ask them if there's any just cause why they shouldn't be joined in
Yes, yes, I do really.
I haven't brought my sword.
Is he?
Gate control.
It's all over, Grendel. That's Zadek and his men. Listen! You might as well surrender now.
Grendel, you forgot your hat!
Ah, there you are. Everyone all right? Thank you.
Oh, it was a pleasure to be of service.
Really? Why, was he supposed to be good?
No, no, no, that's a very kind offer, Majesty, but I have a pressing engagement on the other side of the galaxy. Has anybody here seen Romana?
Kurster? What?
Where?
What!
No!
Don't move! I said, don't move. (to Romana) Ah, you must be Princess Strella.
How do you do. I'm delighted to meet you. Romana.
I'm so sorry to take your new friend away so soon, Miss, but we have some urgent business to attend to.
Right.
Well?
Use the tracer.
Ah!
You were very careless. I found it when I came in here. Come on, let's go.
What? Sorry to leave Tara? I didn't even catch one fish. Not one! Come on!
Well, he. Where's K9?
K9? K9!

You are kidding, aren't you? You want to see Elvis, you go for the late fifties. The time before burgers. When they called him the Pelvis and he still had a waist. What's more, you see him in style.
You going my way, doll?
Hey, you speak the lingo.
Ah, Cliff. I knew your mother'd be a Cliff fan.
Ed Sullivan TV Studios. Elvis did Hound Dog on one of the shows. There were loads of complaints. Bit of luck, we'll just catch it.
That's the one.
Well, this could still be New York. I mean, this looks very New York to me. Sort of Londony New York, mind.
The great occasion? What do you mean?
What Coronation's that then?
Oh! Is this 1953?
Oh, but this is a brilliant year. Classic! Technicolour, Everest climbed, everything off the ration. The nation throwing off the shadows of war and looking forward to a happier, brighter future.
What's going on?
All aboard!
Lost them. How'd they get away from us?
Men in black? Vanishing police cars? This is Churchill's England, not Stalin's Russia.
That's what I like about you. The domestic approach.
Hi!
Let's see, then. Judging by the look of you, family man, nice house, decent wage, fought in the war, therefore I represent Queen and country.
Just doing a little check of Her forthcoming Majesty's subjects before the great day. Don't mind if I come in? Nah, I didn't think you did. Thank you.
Not bad. Very nice. Very well kept. I'd like to congratulate you, Mrs?
Well, maybe she should rattle on a bit more. I'm not convinced you're doing your patriotic duty. Nice flags. Why are they not flying?
Hold on a minute.
Hold on a minute. You've got hands, Mister Connolly. Two big hands. So why is that your wife's job?
And that's a woman's job?
Mister Connolly, what gender is the Queen?
And are you suggesting the Queen does the housework?
Then get busy.
Right then! Nice and comfy, at Her Majesty's leisure. Union Flag?
Oh ho ho ho. I bet she did. Anyway, I'm the Doctor and this is Rose, and you are?
Well, sit yourself down, Tommy. Have a look at this. I love telly, don't you?
Good man!
Keep working, Mister C! Now, why don't you tell me what's wrong?
Yes, I am.
No, the gentleman does.
A lot of people are being bundled into
And I'm not listening! Now you, Mister Connolly, you are staring into a deep, dark pit of trouble if you don't let me help. So I'm ordering you, sir! Tell me what's going on!
Show me.
Her face is completely gone.
Scarcely an electrical impulse left. Almost complete neural shutdown. She's ticking over. It's like her brain has been wiped clean.
Quickly. What was she doing before this happened? Where was she? Tell me. Quickly, think!
Hold on a minute. There are three important, brilliant, and complicated reasons why you should listen to me. One
Ah, hell of a right hook. Have to watch out for that.
Rose, come on!
Rose, we're going to lose them again!
Oh, very good. Very good.
Well, for starters, I know you can't wrap your hand around your elbow and make your fingers meet.
Well, the thing is, Detective Inspector Bishop.
It's written inside your collar. Bless your mum. But I can't help thinking, Detective Inspector, you're not exactly doing much detective inspecting, are you?
All you're doing is grabbing those faceless people and hiding them as fast as you can. Don't tell me orders from above, hmm? Coronation Day. The eyes of the world are on London Town so any sort of problem just gets swept out of sight.
But doesn't it drive you mad, doing nothing? Don't you want to get out there and investigate?
Well, that could change.
Start from the beginning. Tell me everything you know.
Is there any sort of pattern?
Florizel Street.
Rose.
Know her? She
They did what?
They left her where?
In the street. They left her in the street. They took her face and just chucked her out and left her in the street. And as a result, that makes things simple. Very, very simple. Do you know why?
Because now, Detective Inspector Bishop, there is no power on this Earth that can stop me. Come on!
Tommy, talk to me. I need to know exactly what happened inside your house.
Mister Connolly
Tommy?
Tommy, tell me about that night. The night she changed.
Rose said it. She guessed it straight away. Of course she did. All these aerials in one little street. How come?
Come on!
Shop! If you're here, come out and talk to me! Magpie!
Looks like it
Oh, hello. This isn't right. This is very much not right. Tastes like iron. Bakelite. Put together with human hands, yes, but the design itself. Oh, beautiful work. That is so simple.
It's not the only power source in this room.
I'm on my way.
I want my friend restored, and I think that's beyond a little backstreet electrician, so tell me, who's really in charge here?
No, it's just using her image.
So your own people tried to stop you?
And now you're trapped in the television.
Yes, Tommy. It feeds off the electrical activity of the brain, but it gorges itself like a great overfed pig, taking people's faces, their essences. It stuffs itself.
For the first time in history, millions gathered around a television set. But you're not strong enough yet, are you? You can't do it all from here. That's why you need this. You need something more powerful! This will turn a big transmitter into a big receiver.
Tommy, wake up. Tommy, come on!
Where's Magpie?
It's never too late, as a wise person once said. Kylie, I think. The Wire's got big plans. It'll need. Yes, yes, yes, it's got to harvest half the population. Millions and millions of people and where are we?
Muswell Hill. Muswell Hill! Which means Alexandra Palace, biggest TV transmitter in North London. Oh, that's why it chose this place. Tommy?
We're going shopping.
Perfect! Right, I need one more thing.
Got it. Let's go.
Come on!
They're saving me a seat.
King of Belgium, apparently.
Keep this switched on. Don't let anyone stop you, Tommy. Everything depends on it. You understand?
I won't let you do this, Magpie!
Been burning the candle at both ends? You've overextended yourself, Missis. You shouldn't have had a crack at poor old Magpie there.
Rubber soles, swear by them!
It's close down, I'm afraid, and no epilogue.
What have I missed?
Sorted. Electrical creature, TV technology, clever alien life form. That's me by the way. I turned the receiver back into a transmitter and I trapped the Wire in here.
I just invented the home video thirty years early. Betamax. Oh, look. God save the Queen, eh?
Nah, that's just pomp and circumstance. This is history right here.
Exactly.
Hope so. Just to be on the safe side though, I'll use my unrivalled knowledge of transtemporal extirpation methods to neutralise the residual electronic pattern.
I'm going to tape over it.
Tell you what, Tommy, you can have the scooter. Little present. Best, er, keep it in the garage for a few years though, eh?
Is that it, then, Tommy? New monarch, new age, new world. No room for a man like Eddie Connelly.

Rory! That's a relief. I thought I'd burst out of the wrong cake, again. That reminds me, there's a girl standing outside in a bikini. Could someone let her in and give her a jumper? Lucy? Lovely girl. Diabetic. Now then, Rory. We need to talk about your fiance. She tried to kiss me. Tell you what, though. You're a lucky man. She's a great kisser.
Funny how you can say something in your head and it sounds fine.
Oh, the life out there, it dazzles. I mean, it blinds you to the things that are important. I've seen it devour relationships and plans. It's meant to do that. Because for one person to have seen all that, to taste the glory and then go back, it will tear you apart. So, I'm sending you somewhere, together.
Anywhere you want. Any time you want. One condition. It has to be amazing. The Moulin Rouge in 1890. The first Olympic Games. Think of it as a wedding present, because it's either this or tokens. It's a lot to take in, isn't it? Tiny box, huge room inside. What's that about? Let me explain.
It's basically another dimension. What?
I like the bit when someone says it's bigger on the inside. I always look forward to that.
How about somewhere romantic?
Venice.
Venezia. La Serenissima. Impossible city. Preposterous city. Founded by refugees running from Attila the Hun. It was just a collection of little wooden huts in the middle of the marsh, but became one of the most powerful cities in the world. Constantly being invaded, constantly flooding, constantly just beautiful. Ah, you got to love Venice. So many people did. Byron, Napoleon, Casanova. Ooo, that reminds me. 1580. That's all right. Casanova doesn't get born for a hundred and forty five years. Don't want to run into him. I owe him a chicken.
Long story. We had a bet.
There you go, fellow. All to your satisfaction, I think you'll find.
No worries. You were just doing your job. Sorry, what exactly is your job?
How interesting. I heard the plague died out years ago.
Did she now.
Who are those girls?
My first day here. It's okay. Parents do all sorts of things to get their children into good schools. They move house, they change religion. So why are you trying to get her out?
I think it's time I met this Signora Calvierri.
Hello, handsome.
How are you doing that? I am loving it. You're like Houdini, only five slightly scary girls, and he was shorter. Will be shorter. I'm rambling.
Why don't you check this out?
Library card. Of course, it's with. He's. I need a spare. Pale, creepy girls who don't like sunlight and can't be seen. Ha. Am I thinking what I think I'm thinking? But the city. Why shut down the city? Unless
Ooo.
Tell me the whole plan. (sotto) One day that will work. Listen, I would love to stay here. This whole thing. I'm thrilled. Oh, this is Christmas.
I just met some vampires.
And creepy girls and everything.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Amy was just telling me.
Okay. So, first we need to get back in there somehow.
Come and meet my new friend.
No.
Er, that we pretend you're an applicant for the school to get you inside, and tonight you come down and open the trapdoor to let us in.
Gunpowder. Most people just nick stationery from where they work. Look, I have a thing about guns and huge quantities of explosive.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It can't keep happening like this. This is how they go. But I have to know. We go together, say you're my daughter.
Brother, then.
Yeah, that's not helping.
We hope.
Makes you wonder what could be so bad it doesn't actually mind us thinking it's a vampire.
She'll be fine.
Right. Okay, I'll go first. If anything happens to me, go back
Now? You want to do this now?
She was frightened. I was frightened. But we survived, you know, and the relief of it, and so she kissed me.
No. I kissed her mouth.
Rory. Rory, she kissed me because I was there. It would have been you. It should have been you.
Exactly. That's why I brought you here.
Can we go and see the vampires now, please?
Push. Come on. There we are. Amy. Where's Amy? Amy?
Ultraviolet. Portable sunlight.
Let's not go there.
They've had all the moisture taken out of them.
Yeah, except these people haven't just had their blood taken, but all the water in their entire bodies.
Maybe not everyone survives the process.
We should run. Run.
Oh! Rory, come on.
Cab for Amy Pond?
Ah ha!
What?
Classic.
Come on, Rory. Move.
Keep moving. Come on, guys.
Come on. Run.
Long way from Saturnyne, aren't you, Sister of the Water?
I'll make you a deal. An answer for an answer. You're using a perception filter. It doesn't change your features, but manipulates the brainwaves of the person looking at you. But seeing one of you for the first time in, say, a mirror, the brain doesn't know what to fill the gap with, so leaves it blank, hence no reflection.
Why can we see your big teeth?
Where's Isabella?
Gallifrey.
Why are you here?
Wedding present. The Silence?
So Earth is to become Saturnyne Mark Two?
Where's Isabella?
The girl who saved my friend.
I don't think that's such a good idea, do you? I'm a Time Lord. You're a big fish. Think of the children.
This ends today. I will tear down the House of Calvierri, stone by stone. Take your hands off me, Carlo. And you know why? You didn't know Isabella's name. You didn't know Isabella's name.
You're fine. Open wide.
Argh. I need to think. Come on, brain. Think, think, think. Think.
Stop talking. Brain thinking. Hush.
Stop talking. Brain thinking. Hush.
Ah, ah, ah.
Ah. Her planet dies, so they flee through a crack in space and time and end up here. Then she closes off the city and, one by one, starts changing the people into creatures like her to start a new gene pool. Got it. But then what? They come from the sea. They can't survive for ever on land, so what's she going to do? Unless she's going to do something to the environment to make the city habitable. She said, I shall bend the heavens to save my race. Bend the heavens. Bend the heavens. She's going to sink Venice.
And repopulate it with the girls she's transformed.
Where?
Only the male offspring survived the journey here. She's got ten thousand children swimming around the canals, waiting for Mum to make them some compatible girlfriends. Urgh. I mean, I've been around a bit, but really that's, that's eugh.
The people upstairs are very noisy.
Do you know, I knew you were going to say that. Did anyone else know he was going to say that?
Like I said, they're not vampires. Fish from space.
There's nothing left of them. They've been fully converted. Blimey, fish from space have never been so buxom. Okay, move.
Go, go, go, guys. Keep moving. Go, go, go.
No. Guido, What are you doing?
I'm not leaving you. What are you doing?
Argh, bolted.
Guido!
Rosanna's initiating the final phase.
No, no, no. Get back to the Tardis.
We don't discuss this. I tell you to do something, Amy, and you do it. Huh?
You're welcome.
The girls have gone, Rosanna.
Shouldn't I be dead, hmm? Rosanna, please, help me. There are two hundred thousand people in this city.
Get out. I need to stabilise the storm.
Right, so one minute it's all you make people a danger to themselves, and the next it's we're not leaving you. But if one of you gets squashed or blown up or eaten, who gets the
Nothing. Bit of an earthquake.
Manipulate the elements, it can trigger earthquakes. But don't worry about them.
No. Worry about the tidal waves caused by the earthquake. Right, Rosanna's throne is the control hub but she's locked the programme, so, tear out every single wire and circuit in the throne. Go crazy. Hit it with a stick, anything. We need it to shut down and re-route control to the secondary hub, which I'm guessing will also be the generator.
Shut up. Shut up. That's better.
Oh. Oh. Okay.
Rosanna!
I told you, you can't go back and change time. You mourn, but you live. I know, Rosanna. I did it.
No! No!
Now then, what about you two, eh? Next stop Leadworth Registry Office. Maybe I can give you away.
Fine with me.
Yeah, we are.
Rory, listen to that.

What are you both doing in here?
How dare you follow me into the Tardis!
The Tardis, sir! This is a vessel for travelling through time and space! Why did you follow me?
And stand back from those controls. Those controls are used for dematerialising.
You and this young lady are experiencing it. You are now travelling through time and space.
Young man, it's going to be a long time before you see your ship again.
I don't know. That's the cause of half my troubles through my journeys. I never know.
I have no control over where I land. Neither can I choose the period in which I land in. Oh, now, you see that scanner? That is what I call a scanner up there. We get a very good view of the outside.
Ah, yes. I think we've landed in some sort of caves.
Wait, wait, wait, young man, we don't know where we are. We don't know if it's safe or what period we're in.
Yes, I think it's quite normal. Yes, the temperature's all right. Well, I think you can leave, but watch your step.
Oh dear, all this distraction. And I really thought I was going to be alone again.
I never leave it unlocked, my boy.
I'm not going to take you back to London in the Tardis.
My dear young man.
Well, I suppose I shall have to chase after them. Quite incapable of looking after themselves.
Yes, I wonder. Yes, I wonder.
Oh yes, yes! You may know where you are, my dears, but not when. Oh, I can foresee oodles of trouble.
Oh dear, I suppose I'd better follow them. See that they don't get into any harm.
We can't be too sure, my boy.
Oh, good gracious, most of them have been standing there for centuries.
Oh, talk on the train, child.
Well, there doesn't seem to appear any Victorian restoration. I think it could be any time after the 16th century.
Well I don't think so, somehow.
Well, we stopped aside, sir, on our journey to walk along the cliffs and unfortunately we got lost.
No, no. We don't come from this part of the country.
No, just the three of us. You see, we are travellers looking for shelter.
No, sir. Not by sea.
Thank you.
Yes, I'm afraid you're going to lose your bet, young man. That gentleman comes from the seventeenth century.
No, we don't touch it. I wonder if you could direct us to the nearest inn. We seek shelter.
No, I don't think we've met before, no.
Ah, Ben, Ben, Ben. No, sir, we met nobody and saw nothing. Are you, er, expecting some friends?
Avery?
And you are expecting this Avery?
You appear to be afraid, sir. Can we help?
Oh your hand, sir. Are you in pain?
Dislocated.
Oh 'tis naught, 'tis naught, my dear chap. Have another drink. We must be on our way. Goodbye.
Ah, yes, of course, I remember now. Yes, yes, yes. We have to wait until the tide recedes.
We could, of course, stay, if you wish.
Well, thank you for your diligence, sir, and, the kindness of your
Thank you. Thank you.
Yes. We only need shelter for the night.
Thank you. Goodbye.
But what to? What's the purpose, sir?
Yes.
Thank you. Thank you indeed. And I think that's going to be all right now. Yes. Goodbye, sir, goodbye. Come along.
You're the landlord, I presume, hmm?
Oh, we only want rooms for the night, my friend.
Yes.
The Churchwarden said you could probably put us up for the night, but it appears that he was wrong.
Longfoot, sir, Joseph Longfoot. Now surely that name means something to you?
Granted, granted. Now, rooms, a meal, something hot for us. Surely that's possible?
Ah, yes, yes indeed, yes. For the lads. And I think I shall be able to dry myself out with that lovely fire.
Yes, well, I think it better at the moment, my dear. What would they say to a maiden in trousers?
Watch your tongue, dear boy.
Oh, we shall return to the Tardis, my boy, when the tide recedes and let's hope that we materialize in nineteen sixty six.
No, I'm afraid I'm not, my dear. More likely we shall probably land in the far distant future.
Yes, I think they're somewhat suspicious of us.
Well, I wouldn't worry too much about that, my dear, because I don't think we're going to be here long enough to find that out.
I think we would do well to remember the Churchwarden's words.
To keep our thoughts only on ourselves.
I beg your pardon, sir?
I don't think I've set eyes on you before in my life, man.
And what do you mean?
Yes, he merely tried to help us. Barely an acquaintance.
And how do you know all this, sir?
Don't harm them!
And where are you taking me?
I demand
I can tell you nothing, sir.
I do not know this Holy Joe that you keep referring to.
He was a member of your crew?
Avery.
Of course, of course. Avery the pirate. I should have known.
I would prefer you to use the correct term, sir. I am a doctor.
You vicious fellow. Get him off my back!
If I am to reveal something of what I know, then I demand consideration, sir.
Oh, I find your friend rather a bore, but you I think a gentleman. So let us talk like gentlemen.
Well, it's quite obvious to the perceptive eye, sir. Your dress, your manner, your taste. Yes, you're the type of man that has raised himself to an exalted position unaided. Hmm, hmm.
Oh, quite so, quite so. But you are neither a barbarian, or a savage. I can see that.
My dear sir, I'm sure you can quickly see through any flattery of mine.
So let us talk like men of the world. Be elegant, and with dignity.
May I sit down?
Thank you, my man.
Thank you, no. That would indeed be pleasant.
One thing more, before we go on any further.
Now that we understand each other, I think it would only be fair that if I impart the information you require, I should receive some small reward?
In fact, a share?
Yes, indeed, yes. After all my dear Captain. Thank you. There is quite enough to go round, is there not?
Well, here's to a better acquaintance. Mmm. Oh, yes indeed. Yes, a very fine old Madeira. Yes. Indicative of your general taste, sir, if I may say so.
Tell me about my friends.
Why, is there trouble?
Oh, good gracious. We must escape from here and try and help them.
But I don't understand you.
Oh, yes, I quite agree. A somewhat violent man.
Oh, because he thought that I held the secret of the treasure belonging to the deceased pirate, Avery.
Oh, yes, he's determined to get it. Apparently the Churchwarden knew something about it.
But the officers of the law?
Yes, yes, I think I agree. Yes, well, bear with me, sir. I have a plan.
Er, tell me, sir. Er, you play cards?
Now, sir, I hope this works. You may pick up any five cards.
Do you wish me to tell you?
Ah, such brave words, my friend, brave words. But these cards hold the secret to your life or death.
Do not mock that which you do not understand.
Very well, my friend, very well. Be it on your own head.
Oh, beware. Stand back, or you will affect the cards.
Yes, yes, yes, that's very strange. And very disturbing.
Well, I'm afraid they're rather unpleasant. Yes, the first one represents yourself, innkeeper.
Well, the cards have it so, sir.
And the second is master Cherub.
The third is the king. The blackest villain of them all.
Yes, and that is death itself.
Well, I'm afraid I have no idea about that, sir, but I can assure you he will triumph in the end.
Well, you may call it what you wish. I know it's only cards, but sometimes they tell the truth.
Oh, yes indeed. Yes, yes. Aren't you afraid?
Very well then, my friend, shuffle for yourself and let's see them reveal your own fate.
Well done, innkeeper. Now, a rope. Tie him up.
Yes, perhaps, perhaps, yes.
No time for idle speculation. We have to get away from this boat as soon as we can.
Yes, it's our only chance.
Yes, and we've got to hurry if I'm to help my friends.
Yes, because he has them prisoner.
Yes, I think you're quite right, yes. It's better to have the law on our side, isn't it?
Yes, well, I hope your fortune turns out all right, my friend.
Yes, and why not here, my dear?
Oh, my dear child, my dear child, control yourself. Let it suffice that I did escape in the company of Kewper. You remember, the innkeeper?
Yes, that's right. Yes, yes.
Pike intends to sack the old church, and at the same time search for Avery's treasure.
Well, I can't be exact, sir, but pretty soon. I should say tonight or tomorrow night.
Yes, especially if, as Kewper thinks, that the village will be pillaged and burnt too.
Yes, at least the smugglers will have prior knowledge of Pike's plan now that Kewper has escaped.
Yes, be off with you, sir.
Oh, my child, explain yourself.
Oh yes, you mean that place where the Revenue man came out of?
Yes.
Well, I'm afraid, my boy, we can't leave at the moment.
Yes, well I know it's really difficult for both you to understand, but I'm under moral obligation.
No, but it's this village. I feel that I might be responsible for it's destruction, and therefore I must at least try and avoid this danger until Blake comes back.
Ah, wouldn't we, my dear?
Well, you seem to forget, young man, that I've already met Pike, and I know something that he doesn't. The clue to the treasure.
Well, I think if we are able to find that treasure first, we might be able to bargain.
Yes, and it's going to give us enough time for Blake to come back here, and the same time to save the people in this village.
Well said, my boy. Now, let's get down to the church and hope that our luck still holds out. Come on, come on.
Oh, for heavens' sake boy, some kind of code and I'm trying to work it out.
What did you say, dear?
No, no, before. These names. Yes, yes, that's it!
Yes, of course. Dead man's secret.
Yes, yes, of course. That's the answer to the puzzle. Yes. All these dead people.
No. No, not here.
Yes, my dear. Exactly! Good heavens, well, you are inspired. Come on, quickly.
It was some kind of rhyme. Now, let me see. Dead man's secret key. Ringwood, Smallbeer and Gurney.
Well, we must find these names, mustn't we. Yes, that'll be the first step.
Oh yes, of course, dear boy, well, where is it? Where is it?
Yes. Oh, that's very clever. Yes. Very clever indeed, yes. Now just shut it up again, will you. Then we can get on.
Oh, good, my dear. Well, continue with the search. And then the sooner we'll have better you know, the sooner we find the secret.
Ah. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Yes!
Well now, we've found our three names.
Yes, of course, yes. It would help if we found four names.
Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly.
Well, my dear, I
And what are you doing here, sir?
And what name might yours be?
For what purpose?
I hope you don't expect me to help you.
Here, now. Be careful sir.
By stabbing your man in the back, sir? You had us all at your mercy. There was no need for you to kill Kewper.
What is it you want of us?
And suppose we refuse to tell you?
I'm not going to barter with you, sir. Where is your captain?
He would at least listen.
Leave this to me, Ben, my boy.
Have some mercy.
We must play for time now. Trust me.
Well, I must admit the Churchwarden did tell me something, but to be quite honest with you, I am baffled.
The dead man's secret key. Er, Ringwood, Smallbeer and Gurney. Were these names of villages around here?
And Gurney, what of he?
Good men, I take it?
Nothing, I'm afraid, nothing.
Now don't be hasty, please. I said I needed your help. Now this is how.
Yes, get Polly back to the Tardis, and I will follow immediately Blake returns with the men.
There is no other way, child. Without either of you they can't hold a hostage for me to force my hand.
Ah, I've done it before, my dear boy. We must play for time.
Quickly. Quickly. I somehow don't think that master Cherub will be the winner.
Yes, yes.
I think we agreed on that point previously.
My dear Captain, I had every intention of telling you.
I had no choice. My friends are in danger.
Stop! I made a bargain with you, sir, gave you my word. Don't you want me to keep it?
I wish to keep my side of the bargain, but I want to change the terms of my plan. That is, if I may.
I prefer to call them humane, sir.
I would rather not touch it.
I have given you all my reasons. I want no part of the gold, though perhaps I can deliver it to you immediately.
There is no need for innocent people to suffer.
Senseless destruction.
Prove it!
I suppose we must trust you?
Have no fear, Captain. I am not likely to try and cheat you just as he did.
Now, let me see. The Churchwarden set me a riddle which involved four names. Ringwood, Smallbeer, Gurney and Deadman, which should be on that wall, sir.
Ha! Yes, it's there. Just there.
The original names were changed by the Churchwarden.
Yes, that is correct. And unless I am very much mistaken, sir, this flagstone is at the intersection of those fateful names.
Indeed, I think that is what you seek.
Well, how deep is it?
No, I must try and help the Squire.
Oh, thank heavens you're still alive, sir. Let's try and get him out of here.
Oh, a little exhausted, my dear, otherwise I'm all right. Come along, let's get off.
Yes, superstition is a strange thing, my dear, but sometimes it tells the truth.
I have no idea. I have no control over such matters.
My dear boy, it could be a great deal worse.
Just look up at that scanner. We have arrived at the coldest place in the world!

Fine. Marvellous. Refulgent. Possibly a bit embarrassed. That's not dangerous, is it?
Embarrassment.
Good. Hey. Phew.
No worries. My fault. No harm done. Hello there.
Ah. Hello there, Clara.
She's just a girl. How can she be?
She can't be. She is. She can't be. She's not possible.
Well, not strawberries. No. No, no, no. That would be unacceptable.
Within reason. Well, I say reason.
And space, yes.
And space. Totally. So, where do you want to go, eh? What do you want to see?
No. Totally not.
And? Back to the question?
Can you feel the light on your eyelids? That is the light of an alien sun. Forward a couple of steps. Okay. Are you ready?
Welcome to the Rings of Akhaten.
It is. It so completely is. But wait, there is more.
Wait, wait, wait.
In about five, four, three, two
The Pyramid of the Rings of Akhaten. It's a holy site for the Sun Singers of Akhat.
Seven worlds orbiting the same star. All of them sharing a belief that life in the universe originated here, on that planet.
In the universe.
Well, it's what they believe. It's a nice story.
Oh, you know, the local system, mostly.
Well, let's see. Ah! There go some Panbabylonians. A Lugal-Irra-Kush. Some Lucanians. A Hooloovoo. Ah! Qom VoTivig.
That chap's a Terraberserker of the Kodion Belt. You don't see many of them around any more. Oh! That's an Ultramancer. Do you know, I forget how much I like it here. We should come here more often.
Yes, yes, yes. I came here a long time ago with my granddaughter.
Exotic fruit of some description. (scans) Right. Non-toxic, non-hallucinogenic. High in free radicals and low in other stuff, I shouldn't wonder.
No?
For the Festival of Offerings. Takes place every thousand years or so, when the rings align. It's quite a big thing, locally, like Pancake Tuesday.
This isn't an it, it's a she. Dor'een, meet Clara. Clara, meet Dor'een.
Loose translation. She sounds a bit grumpy but she's a total love actually, aren't you? Yes, you are. No, actually, she's just asking if we fancy renting a moped.
Not money. Something valuable. Sentimental value. A photograph, love letter, something like that. That's what's used for currency here. Psychometry. Objects psychically imprinted with their history. The more treasured they are, the more value they hold.
Better than using bits of paper.
With what?
What have you been doing?
Shush, shush. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
Shush.
Shush! Sorry.
They're singing to the Mummy in the Temple. They call it the Old God. Sometimes Grandfather.
The Long Song. A lullaby without end to feed the Old God. Keep him asleep. It's been going for millions of years, chorister handing over to chorister, generation after generation after generation.
Those are offerings. Gifts of value. Mementoes to feed the Old God.
Lay, lay down
Listen. There's one thing you need to know about travelling with me. Well, one thing apart from the blue box and the two hearts. We don't walk away.
I need something precious.
This. And I don't want to give it away, because it comes in handy.
Screwdriver.
Okay, time to let go.
Clara, you have to.
Because it really hurts.
Oh, that's interesting. A frequency modulated acoustic lock. The key changes ten million zillion squillion times a second.
Technically, no. In reality, also no, but still, let's give it a stab.
Because this is sacred ground.
And he's a god. Well, he is to them, anyway.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, hello.
The sonic's locked on to the acoustic tumblers.
Meaning I get to do this.
Hello there. I'm the Doctor, and you've met Clara. She was supposed to be having a nice day out. Still, it's early yet. Are you coming, then? Did I mention that the door is immensely heavy?
Really quite extraordinarily heavy.
Clara?
Yes, and you don't want that, do you? You want us to walk out of this really quite astonishingly heavy door and never come back.
I see. Right. Clara's right. Absolutely never going to happen.
Yep.
What? Before it eats our souls?
Possibly. Probably. There usually seems to be.
He's trying to sing the Old God back to sleep, but that's not going to happen. He's waking up, mate. He's coming, ready or not. You want to run.
That's it, then. Song's over.
That's it, then. Song's over.
Ah ha! Look at that.
Oh, you know. Having a nice stretch.
No, we didn't wake him. And you didn't wake him, either. He's waking because it's his time to wake, and feed. On you, apparently. On your stories.
Same thing. The soul's made of stories, not atoms. Everything that ever happened to us. People we love, people we lost. People we found again against all the odds. He threatens to wake, they offer him a pure soul. The soul of the Queen of Years.
Good. She should be scared. She's sacrificing herself. She should know what that means. Do you know what it means, Merry?
It's not a god. It'll feed on your soul, but that doesn't make it a god. It is a vampire, and you don't need to give yourself to it. Hey, do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard. All the elements in your body were forged many, many millions of years ago, in the heart of a far away star that exploded and died. That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space. After so, so many millions of years, these elements came together to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. The elements came together and burst apart, forming shoes and ships and sealing wax, and cabbages and kings. Until eventually, they came together to make you. You are unique in the universe. There is only one Merry Gejelh. And there will never be another. Getting rid of that existence isn't a sacrifice. It is a waste.
Will be fine.
There's always a way.
Cross my hearts.
And what's the Vigil?
Yes?
Yeah, stay back. I'm armed. With a screwdriver.
Clara. Sonic.
Go!
Grandfather's awake. They're of no function any more.
Actually, I think I may have made a bit of a tactical boo-boo. More of a semantics mix-up, really.
I thought the Old God was Grandfather, but it wasn't. It was just Grandfather's alarm clock.
Unfortunately, yes.
Against that? I don't know. Do you know? I don't know. Any ideas?
I did. I did promise.
Leg it where, exactly?
Oh, the Lake District's lovely. Let's definitely go there. We can eat scones. They do great scones in 1927.
Regrettably, yes. I think I may be about to do that.
I've seen bigger.
Are you joking? It's massive.
No, you're not.
No, you can't.
No. We don't walk away. But when we're holding on to something precious, we run. We run and run as fast as we can and we don't stop running until we are out from under the shadow. Now, off you pop. Take the moped. I'll walk.
Any ideas? No, didn't think so. Righty-ho, then.
Lordy.
Okay, then. That's what I'll do. I'll tell you a story.
Can you hear them? All these people who've lived in terror of you and your judgement? All these people whose ancestors devoted themselves, sacrificed themselves, to you. Can you hear them singing? Oh, you like to thing you're a god. But you're not a god. You're just a parasite eaten out with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow. So, come on, then. Take mine. Take my memories. But I hope you've got a big appetite, because I have lived a long life and I have seen a few things.
I walked away from the last Great Time War. I marked the passing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained. No time. No space. Just me. I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a mad man. I've watched universes freeze and creations burn. I've seen things you wouldn't believe. I have lost things you will never understand. And I know things. Secrets that must never be told. Knowledge that must never be spoken. Knowledge that will make parasite gods blaze. So come on, then. Take it! Take it all, baby! Have it! You have it all!
We don't walk away.
Well, come on then. Eat up. Are you full? I expect so, because there's quite a difference, isn't there, between what was and what should have been. There's an awful lot of one, but there's an infinity of the other.
And infinity's too much, even for your appetite.
Home again, home again, jiggity jig.
Nope. Same house, same city, same planet. Hey! Same day, actually. Not bad. Hole in one.
I don't know. I was just making sure.
You remind me of someone.
Someone who died.
No.
They wanted you to have it.
Everyone. All the people you saved. You. No one else. Clara.

Well, here we are. Hedgewick's World. The biggest and best amusement park there will ever be, and we've got a golden ticket. Eh? Eh? Fun.
It's not the moon.
Hey. Guys. It's not the moon, okay? It's a Spacey Zoomer ride, or it was.
No. No weapons. Golden ticket. Spacey Zoomer. Free ice cream?
How's this?
Oh, the Emperor. No, no. None that you'd er
Right. Righty-o. Well, carry on, Captain.
Yes.
Ha, ha! You see? I told you it was amazing. Well, it used to be.
Cyberman! Get down!
Oh no, Artie. No, don't do that, it
That's a fool's mate.
Hmm. Mirrors. Clever girl. Well, let's see, hey? Low tech. It's a puppet. Monofilament strings, which means the brains are in
Hello.
Hello.
Having a good time?
Yeah. Er, no. Not actually ready to leave.
I don't know. Reasons.
Insects. Funny insects. I should a them to my funny insect collection.
Yeah, I'm starting to, right now.
Not long. Have a nap. I'll wake you when we're ready to leave.
Don't wander off. Now, I'm not just saying don't wander off, I mean it. Otherwise you'll wander off and the next thing you know, somebody's going to have to start rescuing somebody.
Nothing. Nobody needs rescuing from anything. Don't wander off. Sweet dreams.
Clara, did you tell Angie she could go to the barracks?
She's just gone in there.
Clara. Clara!
Listen to me. I will get her back. Captain, a word please. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I take it your platoon doesn't do much fighting.
Right, right, well, okay. As Imperial Consul, I'm putting Clara in charge.
Clara, stay alive until I get back, and don't let anyone blow up this planet.
Get to somewhere defensible.
I'm getting Angie, finding Artie and looking for funny insects. Stay alive. And you lot, no blowing up this planet!
Artie?
Firstly, if anybody's watching this, those children are under my protection. I'm coming to get them. And secondly, little metal machine, you are beautiful.
Not even a Cybermat any more, eh? Cybermites.
Now, there's a local transmat link open to your home. If I can just find the frequency
Hey, that really shouldn't have worked.
Angie? Artie?
Webley.
The people who vanished from the amusement park, they were spare parts for repairs.
Nothing's undefeatable.
Also completely useless to you. Cybermen use human parts. I'm not human. You can't convert non-humans.
Incorporated. Yes. Ah. Unfamiliar pulmonary set-up. Nervous system hyperconductive. Remarkable brain processing speed. Ho, ho. Amazing.
Get out of my head!
Stop rummaging in my mind.
Just you try and stop me. Ooo, who's Clara. Why are you thinking about her so much?
Enough.
Fascinating. A complete mental block. Highly effective.
Relax, relax. If you just relax, you will find this a perfectly pleasant experience. You are being upgraded and incorporated into the Cyberiad as a Cyberplanner.
Get out of my head!
What is this place, a network? A hive? You're getting signals from every Cyberman everywhere. How many of you are there?
Oh, this is brilliant. I'm so clever already, and now I'm a million times more clever. And what a brain. Not a human brain, not even slightly human. I mean, I'm going to have to completely rework the neural interface, but this is going to be the most efficient Cyberplanner. Not a great name, that, is it? I could call myself Mister Clever. So much raw data. Time Lords. There's information on the Time Lords in here. Oh, this is just dreamy.
Right, I'm allowing you access to memories on Time Lord regeneration.
Fantastic!
I could regenerate right now. A big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyberwidgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. You use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can.
Stalemate, then. One of us needs to control this head. We're too well-balanced. What did you say? No, no, no, no, no. I heard you. Rhetorical device to keep me thinking about it a bit more. Stalemate?
We each control forty nine point eight eight one percent of this brain. Point two three eight of the brain is still in the balance. Whoever gets this gets the whole thing.
Do you play chess?
The rules of chess are in my memory banks. You're proposing we play chess to end the stalemate?
Winner takes all. Nobody can access that portion of the brain without winning the game.
You can't win.
Try me.
You understand, when I do win, the Cyberiad gets your brains and memories. All of it.
When I win, you get out of my head, you let the children go, and nobody dies. You got that? Nobody dies!
There. That was easy. The game has just started. Doctor, why is there no record of you anywhere in the databanks of the Cyberiad? Oh, you're good. Oh, you've been eliminating yourself from history. You know you could be reconstructed by the hole you've left.
Good point. I'll do something about that.
The rules of chess allow only a finite number of moves, and I can use other Cyberunits as remote processors. You cannot possibly win.
I can. I know things you don't. For example, did you know very early versions of the Cyber operating system could be seriously scrambled by exposure to things, like gold, or cleaning fluid? And what's interesting is, you're still running some of that code.
Really. That's your secret weapon? Cleaning fluid?
Nope, gold.
Oh ho, ho! Like a charm. Right, you, Cyber Webley, and you kid things. I'll bring the chessboard. Let's get out of here.
Argh! Don't shoot, don't shoot, I'm nice. Please, don't shoot. Hey, Clara, you haven't let them blow up the planet. Good job.
Er, a bit of a good news, bad news, good news again thing going on. So, good news, I've kidnapped the Cyberplanner and right now I'm sort of in control of this Cyberman.
Bad news, the Cyberplanner's in my head. And, different bad news, the kids are, well, it's complicated.
Complicated as in walking coma.
Hope so.
Well, in other good news, there are a few more repaired and reactivated Cybermen on the way, and the Cyberplanner's installing a patch for the gold thing. No, wait, that isn't good news, is it. Er, so, good news, I have a very good chance of winning my chess match.
I'll explain later. In a bit of a hurry. Get me to a table, and somebody tie me up! Need hands free for chess. And immobilise me, quickly.
Right, that's good. I won't be able to move, but hands free. Good.
And winning.
Actually, he has no better than a twenty five percent chance of winning at this stage in the game. Some very dodgy moves at the beginning. Hello, flesh girl. Fantastic. I'm the Cyberplanner.
Afraid not. I'm working the mouth now. Allons-y. Oh, you should see the state of these neurons. He's had some cowboys in here. Ten complete re-jigs.
No, but I know who you are. You're the impossible girl. Oh, he's very interested in you.
Hasn't he told you? The sly devil. Oh, dear me. Listen, soon we'll wake. We'll strip you down for spare parts, then build a spaceship and move on.
They're waking from their tomb right now. You can either die or live on as one of us.
He can't even access the lips.
Argh! Ow! Oh, that hurt. No, stop. Enough, Bit of pain, neural surge. Just what I needed. Thank you.
It's just a thing in my head. I'll explain later.
If he wins, I give up my mind and he gets access to all my memories, along with knowledge of time travel. But, if I win, he'll break his promises to get out of my head and then kill us all anyway.
No.
Children. Yeah. They're fine. I mean, right now their brains are just in stand by mode.
Listen, right now they have a much better chance of getting out of this situation alive than you do.
Me. Cyberplanner. Mister Clever. Now, if you don't mind, I have a chess game to finish, and you have to die, pointlessly and very far from home. Toodle-oo.
Stop that. I felt that.
Of course you did. It's time to get up. Wakey, wakey, boys and girls. Wakey, wakey.
Oi, Clara!
Hey! Clara, there you are. Now, quick rundown. What's our weapons strength?
Yeah. Yeah, that one. Now, tell me, does it happen possibly to have a remote triggery thing?
Brilliant. Pass it here.
Why not?
Oh, don't worry. The Cyberplanner's hibernating between moves right now. Shush.
Clara, I suppose I'm the only one who knows how I feel about you right now. How funny you are. So funny. And pretty. And the truth is, I'm starting to like you in a way that is more than just
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Yes! It's me. That really hurt. How did you know that was him?
I can't. He's got control of the left arm. Argh, argh, no! No!
He got what he wanted. He destroyed the trigger. My move.
He means, good news, boys and girls. They're here!
I've learned so much from you, Doctor. It's been an education. But now, it's time for the endgame.
They're nearly here. Now, you can take my bishop and keep limping on for a little longer, or you can sacrifice your queen and get the children back. But it's mate in five moves, and I get your mind.
Takes my queen, and give me back the children.
Emotions. Can't you see what a foolish move that was? You've lost the game.
Kids back now.
Emotions, Doctor, all for two human children you barely know. And it was a pointless sacrifice anyway. So, Doctor, do you think the children's death will affect your relationship with Miss Clara?
Angie, are you okay? Just look after Artie, okay?
Your move. But before you take it, just so you know, sacrificing my queen was the best possible move I could have made. The Time Lords invented chess. It's our game. And if you don't avoid my trap, it gives me mate in three moves.
How?
How?
Oh, come on. Call yourself a chess playing robot?
How!
You figure it out. Or don't you have the processing power, hmm?
What are you doing?
Doctor. Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. I'm pulling in extra processing power. Three million Cyberbrains are working on one tiny chess problem. How long do you think it's going to take us to solve it?
That's cheating.
No, no, no, no, no. Just pulling in the local resources.
There's no way you can get to mate in three moves.
Three moves. Want to know what they are?
You're lying.
Move one, turn on sonic screwdriver. Move two, activate pulser. Move three, amplify pulser. See you.
That's cheating!
Just taking advantage of the local resources. Ah, hello. Can someone untie me, please?
No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny.
Out of my head and redistributed across three million Cybermen right now, and about to wake them all up, kill us and start constructing a spaceship. We need to destroy this planet before they can get off it.
Okay, it has a fallback voice activation.
And if you don't, three million Cybermen will spread across the galaxy. Isn't that worth dying for?
Three million Cybermen!
Oh yeah. Nice ship. Bit big. Not blue enough. Listen, there is a large blue box at coordinates six ultra nineteen P. I need it transmatted up here right away.
This sounds like an actual marriage proposal. Tricky. Now, if you want my advice
You're not actually going to do that, though, are you? Oh, you're. Hey?
My pleasure. Thank you for coming. Now, I've got something for you. It's not from me, it's from the Tardis. Ah. New phone.
You're welcome.
Bye.
For what?
Well, a Wednesday, definitely. Next Wednesday, last Wednesday
One of the Wednesdays. Impossible girl. A mystery wrapped in an enigma squeezed into a skirt that's just a little bit too tight. Oh yeah. What are you?

Right.
Warm.
Warmer.
Hello.
Oh, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm only going to be a minute. Don't worry. Oh, very warm.
Oh, just ignore me, I'm just passing through, like fish in the night.
It's not fish in the night, it's something else.
No, ships in the night. Yeah, something like that.
Sorry, were you talking to me there? Try again. I promise I'll listen this time.
Sorry. Sorry, I really was planning to listen that time but,  basically, I didn't. Usually, someone hits me at this point, but she's taking the Year 7s for Taekwondo.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Yes! Got you! (laughs) Oh, hang on. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was a robbery.
I just need one tiny little thing from out of this box.
Well, can't we share it? Isn't that what robbery's all about?
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no!
No, you bungled mine, Zorro!
Yeah, well, why don't you show your face? At least I show my face. What's wrong with yours?
You.
Old man?
But didn't you know it was me?
Yes, I didn't get that impression when you were threatening to kill me.
It's a very good voice. How do you do that?
Last time I saw you, you were founding a leper colony. I was so proud of you.
Yes, I was. You didn't see me, but I saw you.
Well, you seemed fine.
Oh, no, this isn't a visit, I've got a job to do. I'm here  looking for an alien object which has no business being here on Earth in  1651.  It was just, it just so happened, you know, that my tracking device, it  led me to the carriage that you were, you know, robbing. There wasn't. I  didn't. It was a
No. It was just a coincidence.
Oh, Ashildr, I'm sorry.
You are. That's your name. Ashildr, daughter of Einarr. Chuckles. I used to call him Chuckles. Do you remember?
You loved that village.
Anyone in that village would have died for you.
Ashildr.
Well, what, what, what do you call yourself?
Yes, you. There's nobody else here.
With what?
It's a big place for someone who lives on their own.
My curioscanner? Oh, it, er, it sort of scans for, it scans for curios. I've just realising how it got its name.  It's been tracking exoplanetary energy for the last couple of weeks. I've been following it across the galaxy.
I've got a pretty good idea, yes. Why?
Clearly, you don't need money. So why do you rob?
A medieval queen? How exciting.
You're immortal, not indestructible. You can be hurt, killed even.
How many people have you killed?
You can't remember?
The Black Death, 1348. I meant to warn you.
Of course, your immune system is learning too. There's another bout coming. And a big fire that tears through London.
No, that was the Terileptils. Surgeon, scientist, inventor, composer, it's a fantastic CV.
You don't seem the nostalgic type.
It can't have been easy, outliving the people you love.
Sorry.
I do know what it's like.
How'd you know I had a ship?
We'll talk about it.
I don't need your help.
Tears.
(reads) Clutching toys as they sleep, never  to wake up. My children. My screams. I could not save you, little ones. Such pain. And yet, still, still I am not brave enough to die, to let go  of this wretched life. I will endure, but no more babies. I cannot,  will not, suffer such heartbreak again. From now on, it's me against the  world.
I read your journals. Why are there pages missing?
What could be worse than losing your children?
I've left you alone too long. I had no idea how much you'd  suffered. But I remember the person you used to be. She's still in  there. I can help you find her.
I think this is just another mask that you wear to protect you from the pain.
This is no way to live your life, de-sensitised to the world.
How do you know? How do you know what I usually do? We've met  once in a Viking village. I didn't give you my life story.
Oh, who told you that?
Not for me. Sonic technology. It should be able to deactivate any alarms.
Now is not the time to be showing off.
Brought my own, thanks.
Why are you still alone? What happened to the second immortality charge I gave you?
Humans need
Humans need shared experiences.
It isn't right for you to be on your own!
The Eyes of Hades.
(sotto) Let's just go round and see if we can't get out the back.
What are you doing?
No, we can't. We should hide.
You're the liability. I never have this trouble with Clara.
Oh, you remember Clara, do you?
There's nothing wrong with her.
Well, look how you turned out.
Save your breath.
Older than you.
Robbery, burglary, that's capital. Meat and drink to the hangman, Ashildr.
No, not the puns. Line in the sand. No puns.
This is banter. I'm against banter. I'm on record on the subject of banter.
We could give you cash instead.
I'm not his dad, I'm the Doctor.
What, says Sam Swift the Quick? That's trying a bit too hard, isn't it? Or are you a little bit slow?
I rest my case. No-one outwits the Knightmare.
Good question.
Also can you confirm that I'm not your dad?
Kill him and you make an enemy of me.
I know their lives are short, I understand, but those lives do matter.
I have a theory about the amulet.
The Doctor.
You keep him on. See, you do have a heart. You don't fool me.
Pink. Are you coming down with something? Look, why would an  alien artefact resemble the Eyes of Hades, King of the Underworld?
An ancient Greek talisman which wards off evil and protects those in death on their journey to an afterlife?
Could it be that the mythology originated on another planet?
No. I think I want to stick around, and keep an eye on you for a while.
Well, why not? Hey, we're a good team.
You don't want to get stuck with an old fool like me. You have this whole wonderful planet to play on.
In the future, you'll fly.
Because it wouldn't be good. Ashildr, please. Ashildr.
Do you have a cat? It sounds like a very big cat. Hence the very big cat flap.
If somebody needed my help, why did nobody just ask? I am forced  to assume you have plans I wouldn't approve of. Oh, Ashildr.
Kill me!
If you intend any harm to this planet or its people, then killing me is by far your best move.
Then tell me why you are here and what you intend to do.  Otherwise, get on with trying to kill me. But I advise you. Be very  quick and very sure.
Using the amulet? That was your means of travel.
The Underworld, gateway to an afterlife, another reality.
Oh! Oh, so what's the plan, Ashildr? Fancy yourself as his new Queen? Hunting, running errands while he sleeps.
Oh, what? And you think you can trust him?
So do I.
I'm looking for the headline here.
Well, you know, you want to escape? Well, go on. Escape as much as you like. Why would I not approve?
What about it?
Of course. Every single death is a tiny fracture in reality, and  the amulet can lever the fracture open. Primitive, but effective.
So who dies so you can run away?
No, you can't. He loves you.
Oh, Ashildr, daughter of Einarr, what happened to you?
I know you've suffered. Your children dying.
I do,
Why should I be responsible for you?
I saved your life. I didn't know that your heart would rust  because I kept it beating. I didn't think your conscience would need  renewing, that the well of human kindness would run dry. I just wanted to save a  terrified young woman's life.
Look, I don't know what Lenny the Lion is up to, but I know his  type. Very first argument, guaranteed he'll bite your head off.
You're playing with fire. Open that portal and you have no idea what horrors might come through.
You're not like this. I know you're not.
He'll kill you.
No, listen, I was trying to help her. She tied
In which case, don't do it.
Do I look like some feckless thief? I'm on your side. I'm an  undercover constable from Scotland Yard. Do you have Scotland Yard yet?
The Dunbar Victory medal. I was decorated for valour in battle.
All I want is to bring the Knightmare to justice.
I came to warn her. I fear her life is in danger.
Look! It's the Knightmare, cloaked and in disguise, bound for Tyburn. You have to let me go, or take me there.
Well, will you take me there if I say yes?
Twenty pounds? Is that all?
Well, in that case, I know where Lady Me keeps all of her money. Almost thirty pounds.
Sorry, yes. Sorry about the horse! Excuse me!
Sorry, excuse me. Excuse me! Sorry!
Have you taken anything for it?
Quick man, I'm running out of patients!
I'm no one's sidekick.
And his nose is so big that
Or, or bury him in a pyramid.
Big handkerchief!
Wait! I have a pardon here for Sam Swift from Cromwell himself.
No! Ashildr, no! No!
Purple, the colour of death. His life force is opening a portal.
Or to Hell.
Doors work both ways. They let people out and they let the enemy in.
Space ships, or they will be. They're coming through the rift, actualising in this plane of reality.
Ashildr! He doesn't care.
It's awful, isn't it? It's infuriating. You think you don't care, then you fall off the wagon.
Welcome back.
Okay. Okay. Er. Eyes of Hades. Afterlife. Death opens up a gateway. We need to close it.
Sam Swift, he's the conduit. The amulet, it's still in him. It's his death that's opening the rift. So what do we do?
Run!
Yeah, I could tell. Gave a whole new meaning to dying on stage.
Do you want him to be?
Well, probably not. Probably the power would have been drained by the whole opening and reversing the portal thingy.  There'll be enough power to bring him back, but not enough power to keep him here, probably.
Yeah. But it's hard to keep track of all this stuff. Keep an eye  on him though. He might be around for a while. Or not. Who can say?
People like us, we go on too long. We forget what matters. The  last thing we need is each other. We need the mayflies. See, the  mayflies, they know more than we do. They know how beautiful and precious life is  because it's fleeting. Look how Sam Swift made every last moment count,  right to the gallows. Look how glad he is to be alive. I looked into your eyes and I saw my  worst fears. Weariness. Emptiness.
You're not the first, you know. I did travel with another immortal once. Captain Jack Harkness.
He'll get round to you eventually. Who told you about me? The  man who comes for the battle and runs away from the fallout.
Sometimes tidal waves.
Well, you should be. You're an extraordinary woman, Ashildr. But I think I'm going to have to keep an eye on you.
No?
So are we enemies now?
Ashildr, I think I'm very glad I saved you.
Oh, hello! Hi.
Be more specific. Who are you?
Why? Am I ill?
Are you ill?
Are you never going to travel with me again, because I said a thing?
Oh, well that's a relief.
That was her fault because she should have stressed imaginary.
Yes, you're right. That is not a good present.
Do they make sherbet lemons any more? And I'd like a Ferrari. What about a Ferrari?
Okay, come on, let me see, let me see. Let me see, let me see.
Nothing. Nothing at all.
Tell her next time, I'll take cash.
Wherever you want.
Ah, there is nowhere new under the sun. Above it, on the other hand.
I've missed you, Clara Oswald.

Jamie! Jamie! The doors! We've got to close the doors! Can you do it?
That's it, Victoria. Hold on. Whatever you do, hold on!
No, no, you're not. I've got hold of you. Don't look out there. Concentrate on holding on.
Yes, you can. That's the style.
All right, but watch the Tardis doesn't lurch again.
Well done.
You know the switch?
It's all right, they're closing!
Oh, well done, Jamie. You did it! That was a near thing, wasn't it? Are you all right, Victoria?
Oh yes, I think so. Salamander started the Tardis without first closing the door. He was sucked out.
I'm very glad you didn't. He's not in a very enviable position, you know, at the moment, floating around in time and space. Now then, where shall we go?
Can't control it?
We'll see about that. We'll see about that.
Yes, I wonder.
Now, Jamie, if that light had come on, we'd have landed, wouldn't we?
But we're still travelling, aren't we? So how could it have done?
What?
Oh, yes, very sophisticated, Victoria. Go on, Jamie. Don't you?
What?
I see. Are you two playing some sort of game?
Well, then we are landing, aren't we?
Now shush. The scanner, that will tell us.
I don't know. Something strange has happened. We're suspended in space
Gravity?
Power?
Control?
Flight.
There you are, you see? I was right. It is all working.
Just a minute, Victoria. If the time lock has slipped
I don't know. But something or someone is holding us here.
Oh. Oh yes, that'll do, Jamie, I think. Just get that in there and that'll be excellent. There we are, that should work.
Oh, nothing.
Well, nothing yet, but it will do once we start moving again.
Yes, of course we will, Victoria. You see, whatever's holding us must let go sometime.
Right. Now Jamie, give me a hand while there's still time. Plug this in.
Plug it in there. Yes, that's right. Now listen, both of you. As soon as we land, whatever you do, don't let go. Hold on.
There. Now, hold tight
Oh, it's not so bad as I thought.
Is everyone all right?
Well, I've managed to move us on a bit. Not very far, perhaps half a mile from where we were expected to land. For the moment, we have eluded our captor. Look at the scanner, both of you.
I really don't know, Victoria. Shall we go out and have a look?
Oh, I shouldn't think so for a moment. Jamie, I think we're going to need torches.
Some sort of grille.
It could be the dungeons of a castle.
Ah, steps. Come along, be careful.
Yes, it seems to be a large room. Tiled walls, curved ceiling. Come on.
What have you found, Victoria?
Covent Garden. Oh yes, of course. It's an underground station. We're standing on the platform.
Trains. Underground trains. A little after your time, I think, Victoria.
No, no, no. It's probably the middle of the night. Come along, let's go up top. There'll be lots of light up there. Funny, isn't it?
How we keep landing on your Earth!
Just a minute. Just let me get my breath. Those stairs.
Well, that's strange.
Yes?
Oh, it is quiet. I see what you mean. The middle of London, there should be some noise.
Yes, go on.
It's all right, it's all right.
Yes, yes. Now, come along.
But we've got to get above ground, Victoria. Now let's try the next station. Come along.
Jamie, no! Don't move! Don't touch the rails.
Whatever you do, stand still! Stand still. Don't move. Keep quite still, Jamie.
Oh, it's all right. You can relax. The electricity is off.
If there had been a current running through these rails, you'd have been fried!
Electrified. Brunched! Burnt up! Now, come along. It's safe now, I think, but we'd better be careful. Follow me
Just confirming something. Yes, just as I thought. There haven't been any trains here for some time.
It's a power cable. I wonder what it's doing down here?
In there, quick.
Soldiers? I wonder what they're doing down here?
No. I think we'd better tread carefully. Let's go and find out what's going on first.
You follow the soldiers, but keep out of sight. I'm going to see where this cable goes to. Meet back here in a few minutes, all right?
Victoria!
Well.
Well, you see, Victoria.
Well, yes. Where is Jamie, Victoria?
Travers? What do you mean, Travers?
Me?
Come along, Victoria.
Yes, yes, I'm quite all right, Victoria. I was just knocked out by the explosion a bit, that's all.
Well, I don't know. When I came to, there was no sign of the Yeti, so I wandered around for a bit and then, as I was on my way back to you, he suddenly popped out from nowhere.
When I saw the Yeti, I put two and two together. And then now you say Travers is here, well.
Yes, I was wondering when you where going to get around to me.
Who?
My word, it is. It's been a long time.
Oh, she's on my staff.
Yes, well as I say, when I came to there was no sign of the Yeti, so I wandered around a bit, got lost and saw the fungus.
Not me, then?
From what Victoria said, you had one or two suspicions about me.
But why? That's what I can't understand. Why?
But how, that's what I can't understand. What brought the Intelligence back again?
Yes.
Oh dear.
Don't tell me. It just disappeared.
Yes. Well presumably, once the sphere started working, the Intelligence just homed in on it.
This mist, does it do anything? I mean, is it poisonous or anything?
Any sign of the Yeti by this date?
Ah yes. My word, I thought I wasn't mistaken. Those Yeti have changed in appearance. Look.
It's a sort of Mark Two, isn't it.
I wonder how the Intelligence managed that?
Sorry.
Have you had any success against it yet?
What about telephones?
Well, as far as I can see, what we most need is time. Now if we were to blow the tunnel here, just above Goodge Street, we could seal ourselves in for a bit.
I've thought of that. Got anything on wheels, something that will run along a track?
Well, it's simple enough. We lay the explosives on the trolley and set a triggering device, and then blow it up while it's on the move.
Come on, Travers, let's fix up this detonator.
Ah, there you are, Victoria. I've been looking for you everywhere. Oh, my word. That looks familiar. It doesn't work, does it?
Ah, good. Fine. This should do the trick. It's both timing and contact.
Yes. Just push the trolley down the gradient, and that should give you enough time to get clear.
Well, if it comes into contact with anything, it'll blow up at once.
Did you see inside?
There's only one way of finding out, isn't there?
Well, now we know. How are we going to blow up the tunnel now?
The Yeti have dealt with the explosives here, and I'm willing to bet they'll do the same with those at Holborn as well.
I think you're wasting your time now, Colonel.
Will I?
Someone here is in league with the Yeti. Maybe even controlling them.
The main door didn't open by itself, did it? It may be any one of us.
Perhaps.
Oh?
What's the matter with him?
Well, he's too late. They've already left. Wait a minute. Why doesn't he want them to blow up the tunnel?
You didn't tell him about the Tardis, did you?
Yes, I do think!
There you are. It's locked. Victoria!
Wait.
Jamie!
Jamie, have you seen Chorley?
Have you seen anyone leave headquarters here?
Right, come along, no time to waste.
Come on, I'll tell you as we go.
It's this way to Covent Garden.
Yes, certain of it. Why else would he lock us in?
No, no, no, if he did it doesn't matter, does it? Come along, this way.
This looks familiar. It's around this corner.
No, Victoria, I'm afraid we can't.
That's what I'm wondering. Did he reach the Tardis before the fungus, or did he not?
I don't know.
It's all right, Jamie. I'm not going to do anything silly. I just want to try and get a little bit for analysis.
It's all right, Victoria. Has anyone got a box?
Oh, splendid.
Never mind.
Hold the tin for me, would you, Evans?
Hold the tin underneath. There we are. Now back, everyone, quickly!
Any luck at Holborn?
Come on, Jamie, I'll just show this bit of fungus to Travers.
Let's see, Jamie.
Good Lord! That's Yeti!
No.
Quiet, Victoria.
Anne!
Yes, yes, I think she'll be all right. Evans, get a chair for her, will you? Get her up, Jamie. Come along. It's all right. It's all right now, Anne. Sit down.
It's all right now.
Yes, they've gone now. It's quite safe now.
Jamie, you'd better get her to the Common Room.
You go too, Victoria.
Lie her down.
Have what?
Yes, I'm very much afraid they have. But why? Why didn't they just kill him? Unless
Well, unless they had a use for him.
Well, the Yeti broke in while we were out looking for Chorley.
Well, I'm not quite sure.
Well, the answer's simple. They came for something, and they got it.
Well, Travers.
Yes. And we're the flies, all right, but where is the spider?
I doubt it.
Yes. So has Chorley. I'd say he was a much more likely suspect.
On the other hand, of course, whoever is in league with the Intelligence could still be amongst us here.
Well, I wish I could give you a precise answer. Perhaps the best way to describe it is a sort of formless, shapeless thing floating about in space like a cloud of mist, only with a mind and will.
I wish I knew. The only thing I know for sure is that it brought me here.
Yes, well, I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. I have a craft that travels in time and space.
Well, yes, but it's at Covent Garden.
It's a police box.
Yes, yes, I could, but I have to stay here and finish Travers' work.
Very good, Jamie. Excuse me, gentlemen, please.
No, the soldiers could comb these tunnels for a fortnight and still never find him. I'm afraid your father's been taken by the Intelligence. The only way that we can save him is by finding the central control source.
Yes, I know. Tell me. What was your father working on just before the Yeti broke in, Anne?
But don't you? If he was near to success
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it? Now Anne, do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory?
No, no, you just take it easy, Jamie. Come along.
Oh yes. Yes, this seems to be in order, Anne.
Very wise. Let's have a look at this
Oh yes, yes. My word, this is a splendid piece of work, Anne.
Yes, this should control the sphere all right, but would it override the commands issued by the Intelligence, I wonder?
We can do it if you've got the right bits and pieces.
Where'd you get this?
But this is what brought the Yeti to the explosives store. It's obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device and you've given it to me!
Thank you.
Don't look so unhappy. We're all under suspicion, you know, including me.
It's the fungus from the tunnel. I thought if we examined it, it might give us a clue. I must get this dismantled. It's like holding a time bomb.
Now you'd better stand back, Anne.
This fungus is an unknown quantity, you know.
Oh, Jamie, what is it?
On his way where?
He's wasting his time.
Shush. Now look. Get behind me, both of you, and keep clear. Here we go.
No!
The tin's empty! Evans.
Yes, yes, I know, but don't worry about that just at the moment. I've been working on this control box of Miss Travers'. There's a few more things I need. Transistors, circuits.
No, not of the right type.
Well, I was wondering if I could go up to street level
There's no mist directly above us here. We'd have to risk the Yeti.
It'd only take five minutes.
Well done, Travers.
Just one more thing.
I just need one more component. I'll look through here.
No, no, no, he didn't steal it. The person who did planted it on him.
All right, all right, let's keep our temper, shall we? The point is two of these were missing. Now where's the other one?
There. That one shouldn't bother us any more. Now then, come along, Anne, let's get down to work. Where did I put those bits and pieces?
Colonel!
Colonel, what happened?
All of them!
Listen. Listen, everyone! It's the other Yeti model. It's here! It's somewhere in this room!
Your pockets!
Open your pockets, Colonel. Quickly, quickly, come on!
They bring the Yeti!
No, no.
No, Anne. Don't go near him. Just listen to him.
What do you want?
Yes.
Oh, I see, so that's why you've brought me here. Revenge.
And what's that?
What do you want?
And if I refuse?
But you can't!
Yes, I believe you.
And if I do submit, what of the others?
And who are they?
No, Jamie, no.
Jamie, don't be a fool. You don't stand a chance.
He left one of those things there to stop us getting away. Now, Victoria is quite safe.
The Intelligence knows that if it harms her, I won't cooperate.
Yes, Anne, it does.
Yes, I'm sure!
Jamie.
It's all right, Evans. If I don't come up with the answer, I will give myself up, I promise.
Don't be foolish, Jamie!
She will be your responsibility. And when it's all over, you'll just both have to look after me, that's all.
Well, if what the Intelligence says is true, my mind will be like that of a child. You'll have to look after me until I grow up.
Don't worry. I'm going to try not to let it happen.
I sincerely hope it won't come to that, Anne.
This control box. We've got to get it working!
Then there's no time to lose, is there? Oh, come on, Anne, don't give up. I need your help.
Right. Now hand me that sphere, will you?
And the cross wires here.
Well, I haven't finished yet. Now if you detach the germanium crystal strip here, and then attach the collector and the emitter.
Simple?
Right. You get on with that.
And I'll just check this sphere. Yes. Yes, that should complete the circuit. Good. I wonder?
Strange, it's not picking up. The Intelligence must be transmitting. I wonder why it's not working.
Come along.
Help you in a minute.
There we are. Yes, you see, it's homing. There we are. Fairly strongly
Careful. Shut the door.
Why, what's happened?
Well, I'm not surprised. I thought the Intelligence would try to hem us in.
Come on, Anne. We must get to work.
Well, the sphere itself, it won't.
No. But it will help us to test the control box.
All?
Wasted? We haven't been wasting our time.
Right, Anne. Let's get on with this control box.
Nearly ready. There. Now then, let's see if it works.
Yes.
Hang on a minute
Ah ha!
Back you come. Yes, the trouble is, it only works at very short range.
Well, we know that your control box can stop a Yeti. Now then, if I can re-programme this sphere to obey our verbal commands.
How long have we got?
No, don't shoot!
It is now. Stop.
Were you scared?
Simple, I told it to.
All right, I will. Move forward. Stop. Move to the left. Stop. There you are, how about that?
But it obeys our commands.
Well, once we get it inside a Yeti, we'll have a powerful ally.
Oh. Very well, Anne, I shall have to do it myself.
No, no, it's far too dangerous.
Do you think it's mutating, Anne?
No, perhaps you're right.
Give me the control box, Anne.
Yes.
What? Hold the sphere!
Yes.
Don't worry, it'll work. It's got to work!
Don't tell me you were worried? Would you like to hold this for me? Now then. It's all right, it's quite safe.
Now then. Turn round!
We've done it, you mean. Now then, with my reprogrammed sphere and your control box, we should be able to work him over quite a distance. And put your arm down.
Now we've got a chance, Anne. Come on. Oh, mustn't forget him. Come on, Fred, at the double.
Anne.
Stop. Come back here. Stop. Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence, everyone must be suspect.
Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.
I know. You are to remain here for, do you think a minute will be enough?
For us to get clear.
You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?
Right. Switch off for ninety seconds starting from now. Come on, Anne.
Yes, I know.
Well, as a matter of fact. I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.
Any news of Victoria?
Piccadilly?
Are they all right?
How do you know?
Arnold?
We haven't got any time to find out.
Yes.
We can't do anything until we get back to Headquarters, and then, if we've got time, we'll try and increase the range of the control units.
Come on.
What is it, Colonel?
No.
Yes.
Him.
Well, you never know, do you?
I don't know.
Well, unfortunately I've lost track of him.
Well, never mind, I want you to take this microphone and keep on calling our Yeti to you.
You'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you. Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia.
Hmm?
It's in my pocket.
Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.
What is it?
Well, go on.
You mean, am I going to give myself up?
You believe that?
Listen.
Now listen, everyone. When the Yeti come for you, don't struggle. Whatever you do, don't resist them.
Thank you.
Now don't worry, Victoria.
Everything's under control. Don't be frightened.
Everything is under control. Tell her, Anne. You understand.
Now listen, everyone. Don't do anything foolish! I am perfectly all right.
Frightened that something might go wrong?
Do what he says, Jamie.
You gave your word that no one would be harmed. I refuse to submit until you release Jamie!
Don't worry. I will do what you say.
Just get on with it, please.
I just want it over and done with.
No!
No, you don't understand. You'll ruin everything! No!
No! No! No! Leave me be! You don't understand. I've got to stay here!
You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told!
You're just as bad. I told you to leave it to me! Now you've gone and ruined everything.
No!
Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? I had crossed those wires on that helmet thing. The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I would have drained the Intelligence! As it is, all we got was a crossed circuit.
Precisely! Look.
No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was probably one of the first to disappear.
Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed.
I doubt it.
You don't really think so, do you.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no!
Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left.
Goodbye!
I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go.
Covent Garden. Come along. Come along, Jamie. Goodbye, Travers.
Well, where do we go? Which is the way to Covent Garden?
Come on, let's try this way.
Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on!

Well, I suppose you know where you are, my dear.
Oh, when you've seen the ages that I've see, you won't use that term quite so freely. Anyway, I don't think it's been all that long.
Oh, well, you see, the problem is, coming back to the twentieth century, my dear, the Tardis, I'm afraid, is often mistaken for the real police box.
Yes, and fortunately he can't get in.
So that's it!
Isn't that interesting. Very interesting.
You know there's something alien about that tower. I can sense it.
I can feel it's got something sort of powerful. It's. Look at my skin. Look at that. I've got that pricking sensation again, the same. Just as I had when I saw the Daleks, those Daleks were near.
Oh, er, yes, of course, you, er, you didn't meet them, did you, child? No. No, and I pray that you never will. I really must investigate it.
Well, hardly a specialist, sir, but I dabble, yes, I dabble. Oh, so that's what it is.
Yes, you know I had a very strong sense of energy outside this building, a sort of magnetic pull if you like. It was most unusual, so I presume that's what it must have been.
Most ingenious.
Is that so?
Oh, ah, my secretary, Dodo Chaplet.
Oh, tonight, sir?
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, of course, my dear fellow, yes, eh Dodo?
You call what?
Oh, yes, yes, quite so.
Are you seriously telling me, sir, that you have invented a machine that can think?
And never makes mistakes?
I take it that I speak into here.
Er, what is the square route of 17422?
One moment please. 131 point 993. Yes, that's near enough. Yes, it's truly remarkable.
Well, what did it say my dear?
Good heavens! Let me see. Well now, how would it know that?
Dodo!
What's the matter my dear, are you All right?
Oh. Just sit down a moment.
Now tell me, sir, now tell me, what part does this play?
I see. And that of course is the programme regimentator?
Yes, I wonder
Yes, I am, Sir Charles.
Yes, very odd, very odd indeed. Perhaps he's overworking. Who was that little man, Krimpton?
I wonder. I wonder.
Ah, I thought I'd find you both here. Well I hope Dodo and yourself have enjoyed yourselves.
Fab gear. Who is your friend?
Ah, yes, how do you do, my boy.
I don't see Dodo about.
She's gone? Gone where, child?
Yes, a good idea. Thank you, that's very kind.
Oh, Chaplet, Dodo Chaplet.
Oh, my dear child.
Yes, we've been extremely worried about you.
Indeed, you were. You didn't tell me about your friends. And how did they know that you might be here?
Well, I sincerely hope so. And by the way, my child, Sir Charles Summer and his family have asked us to pay a visit. So if you'll excuse us, I think we'd better be off.
Yes, I suppose isn't too late to get a cab, is it?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I suppose so.
Er, yes, goodnight my dear. Goodnight, young lady, goodnight.
Oh, yes.
Well, that's very helpful of him, I thought.
But, are you sure, my dear?
Oh, very well, my dear.
Oh!
Oh, yes, good boy, good boy.
Oh, come along, my man. We're in a hurry. Come along.
Eh? Oh, yes, yes. Here. Now look, give him that, my dear.
Come along. Come along, Dodo. All right, off you go, off you go, off you go.
Goodbye young man, goodbye.
Drive on.
Good gracious!
Well, just take a look at this, Sir Charles.
Yes. Three o'clock. That must have been after we left him!
No, we met last night, or rather, early this morning. We used his taxi which he left in Covent Garden.
Oh, yes, it is possible, of course.
Oh, I don't know, Sir Charles, I don't know.
Oh, yes? What's this then?
Oh yes, I see, yes. There's no reason given at all, is there?
Yes, I wonder, Sir Charles, do you suppose, er? No, I don't suppose you would.
No, no, no, thank you.
Morning, morning.
Oh, there she is, child. Perhaps you'd better ask her yourself?
No, child, no. You're right on time. Well, I'm sorry, Sir Charles, I can't help you with your problem, but I'm afraid I'm rather out of touch.
Oh but my dear, I thought you were going to show me round London this morning.
Oh, that's very nice of you. Yes, very understanding.
Ah, I think perhaps I'd better phone his office first.
Do you mind if I use the phone?
Thank you.
Yes, yes, I want to speak to Professor Brett. Yes, he's at the General Post Office tower. That's right, yes.
Argh!
Oh no, no, no.
No. Just water.
What happened?
Oh, what are you talking about, child?
What were you saying, my dear?
Yes, yes, I think I remember, I was speaking to Professor Brett and all of a sudden there seemed to be an explosion. It very nearly knocked me off my feet. It was as if, as if
It was if something enormous and terrific was trying to absorb me. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, it's ridiculous, child, isn't it? Yes, yes, yes, there's something erratically wrong with that telephone, yes. It was just like an electric shock.
From whom, my dear?
Yes, yes, thank you.
That's it. Either that telephone is dangerously out of order, or
Stay where you are, my dear.
There's a new and deadly danger facing us. Yes, and it's coming from Professor Brett's office.
None of us do. Yet. Come here, my dear. Look at me. Yes, it's just as I thought. She's been hypnotised. Sit in that chair, my dear.
Now, I want you to repeat after me. My name is Dodo Chaplet.
I resist all attempts to change me into somebody else.
Now, I'm going to start counting. And when I've counted up to five, you will be fast asleep. And when you wake again, you will forget all about this distressing incident. Now I'm going to start counting. Just look at that ring on my hand.
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Yes, I think she'll sleep for forty eight hours, and when she wakes I want absolute peace and quiet for her. Do you understand?
Oh yes, she's all right.
Yes, it's a very fine thing. Yes, and take care of her, won't you.
I don't know. She said something about strategic points in London.
Where, I wonder? Where?
Oh, Ben. How did you know I was here?
Didn't she keep that appointment?
Oh, dear me, it's just as I feared.
Oh, she's a little under the weather and she's gone into the country for a few days.
Oh she'll be quite all right, yes, really. I'm rather worried about Polly. She appears to be missing, that child.
No, I think it's far more serious than that. That tramp in the paper. Did you see it?
Well, I'm not so sure that it does, my boy. That's why I want to solicit your help in this matter. I think, er, I don't think you will arouse so much suspicion as the police might.
Well, I want you to investigate in and around that neighbourhood where we were last night in that club.
Yes, and be careful, my boy. This might be dangerous.
Oh dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
Oh yes, that boy, that boy should be back here ages ago.
Well, he seemed quite a responsible young lad. I suppose if he hasn't phoned it's because he hasn't been, er, well, he has not been able to.
No Sir Charles. I don't think we should allow the police to intervene at the moment. Otherwise we might drive this threat further underground or wherever it is.
Well, unless I'm very much mistaken we're going to have a lot more than rumour to contend with. Oh, dear me, where is that boy?
Well, I can't wait any longer. I must take a look for myself.
After what happened to Dodo, my dear sir, we should never have let those youngsters out of our sight.
That might be Ben now.
Ah, come in my dear. Good heavens.
My dear boy. What's happened to you, lad?
Now, take your time, take your time. Now, where's Polly?
What do you mean, they've got her? Where is she?
Where?
Well, I'm afraid I do.
Yes, I had suspected something of that sort.
Oh, my dear Sir Charles! How could you know that?
We are not wasting time, my dear boy. We need Sir Charles' authority, his help. Without this we can do nothing.
I am quite prepared to accept the truth of this boy's statement.
No, Sir Charles. I think the police might find it too big for them to handle at the moment.
And you say that they were obeying this machine?
I'm afraid we've got all our priorities mixed up. They might be able to destroy this machine, but in all probability there are others waiting to attack us.
Exactly. And we don't know their location. And I doubt very much if we can find them all by tomorrow noon. No, I think we should strike at what I believe to be the centre of this menace. WOTAN.
Well, I fear we've riled him, my boy. You see, the official mind can only take in so much at a time. However, we must keep our weather eyes open. Come along.
What is happening, Sir Charles?
And what is in there?
Wait, my boy.
It's remarkable, truly remarkable!
Oh, how do you do sir!
Oh yes, this is all very simple. This is a computer, and this computer hasn't been completely programmed.
Exactly, and my guess is this was put into action before it was ready, sir.
Well, I hope that we're just as lucky next time, gentlemen. Let me have that screwdriver, young man.
Oh don't worry, my boy. She'll be back.
My dear young man, I haven't the time to discuss Polly at the moment. If I'm going to analyse this mechanism I've got a great deal to do. Now. oh dear, I'm so hot. Wait a minute, let me take this cloak off. Here. Now hold onto that and don't drag it on the floor, there's a good boy.
Well, yes, I think I've managed to decode the programme mechanism. And if I'm right, I think there are eleven others in London, perhaps in an area of twenty to thirty miles. And this has it's own timing device, this computer. And I think if my calculations are right, then we conclude that they were intended to attack at twelve o'clock today.
Just a moment, sir, please. Major Green?
Yes, of course. Do you remember me, Major Green?
Yes, I think you'll have to have him removed, gentlemen. He may need medical attention.
Yes.
Oh, of course he is. He remembers nothing since he was taken over by Brett's computer system.
Yes, I am.
What do you intend to do there, sir?
That is very dangerous, Sir Charles. And if I may say so, your strong arm methods have already got us into plenty of trouble.
My dear boy, if we worry about one person we shall never solve anything, shall we?
Somehow we've got to get a hold of that machine.
Yes, and I think our only one chance is to paralyse the nervous system of that mechanism. Yes, and if I remember rightly, it will be electromagnetically controlled. Yes, in other words, gentlemen, we've got to capture it!
I shall need equipment, Sir Charles. Sufficient equipment to set up a powerful magnetic field and it must operate effectively within say twenty feet.
Well, I'm afraid that we have no choice, gentlemen.
Well now, where was it reported last?
Now just a moment, Sir Charles. Now look. If you close that road there, this and this, then we can funnel it into here, and there, gentlemen, we can spring our trap!
Oh well, allow me to illustrate, Sir Charles. Now, to set up a magnetic field I want a four square box formed by four cables.
Well exactly! Therefore, we must prepare these three first and then, when the machine has approached and appeared in that position we connect the fourth cable and switch on.
I shall connect the cable myself.
That is a risk we have to take.
I beg your pardon, young man?
I shall allow it to come within twenty feet, so don't be alarmed, my friend.
Now wait for it! Until he's in the area! Wait, wait!
Not yet, not yet!
Now!
Now!
I want you to remain up here, Sir Charles, until I give the signal.
Ah, temper, temper.
Switch off, Sir Charles!
Well, to coin a phrase, Sir Charles, I neutralised it. Quite a harmless looking fellow, don't you think? We must find a way to get it down to Covent Garden.
Well, I think that's about all, gentlemen.
I've made an important readjustment to aid and change the purpose of this machine.
Well, you could say that, of course, yes. I hope it will carry out a special programme that I've fed into it.
Well, my dear Sir Charles, we can soon find that out, can't we? Would you mind just standing back for a moment? Now, my dear Ben, just carry out what I've asked you to do.
It's quite safe, gentlemen.
Well, it all started at that Tower.
Yes, in Brett's office. And I think it will probably end there.
Well, I'm afraid we can't check up on that now, my boy. My machine has to face WOTAN before noon!
No, no, no, you can't. You won't be able! Oh, you foolish boy!
Well, it will be like the crossing of two electrical currents. My machine has to face up to Brett's computer, WOTAN.
Well, those people that have been under some form of hypnosis will return to their normal selves.
There's nothing you can do for the poor fellow.
All immobilised, Sir Charles, waiting for orders. Orders that will never come!
There you are, my child. It's nice to see you so well again. And you, my boy, away from that wretched tower.
Oh, yes, I've been waiting around here for her. Where is she? I very nearly left without her.
Yes, er, to the airport, yes. She is well, I hope?
Her love? Oh, there's gratitude for you. Take her all the way around the world, through space and time, and then
Er, what? I, er, nothing, my dear boy, nothing. Now, I think you both want to get away, don't you? Thank you, Polly, very much. Thank you, Ben.
Goodbye. Run along, enjoy yourselves. Yes.

Set the controls to random. Mystery tour. Outside that door could be any planet, anywhere, anywhen in the whole wide u. Are you all right?
I could always take you home.
I know what it's like. Everything you're feeling right now. The fear, the joy, the wonder? I get that.
Yeah. Why do you think I keep going?
Snow! Oh, real snow. Proper snow at last. That's more like it. Lovely. What do you think?
Look at that view.
Millions of planets, millions of galaxies, and we're on this one. Molto bene. Bellissimo, says Donna, born in Chiswick. All you've got is a life of work and sleep, and telly and rent and tax and takeaway dinners, all birthdays and Christmases and two weeks holiday a year, and then you end up here. Donna Noble, citizen of the Earth, standing on a different planet. How about that Donna?
Donna?
Better?
Comfy?
Can you hear anything inside that?
All right, I was saying, citizen of the Earth
Hold on, can you hear that? Donna, take your hood down.
That noise is like a song. Over there.
An Ood. He's called an Ood.
Donna, don't. Not now. It's a he, not an it. Give me a hand.
I don't know where the heart is. I don't know if he's got a heart. Talk to him, keep him going.
No. No, no, no. You don't need to.
You've been shot.
Circle? What do you mean? Delta 50, what circle? Delta 50? What circle?
Careful.
The snow'll take care of that.
They're servants of humans in the forty second century. Mildly telepathic. That was the song. It was his mind calling out.
His eyes turned red.
Trouble. Come on. The Ood are harmless. They're completely benign. Except, the last time I met them, there was this force, like a stronger mind, powerful enough to take them over.
Oh, long story.
It was the Devil.
Must be something different this time, though. Something closer to home. Ah ha! Civilisation.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Late. Don't mind us. Hello. The guards let us through.
The Doctor and Donna Noble.
Oh, no, no, no, no. We're not married.
Never.
Oh, what's that? That sounds like an alarm.
Ah, got it. The Ood Sphere, I've been to this solar system before. Years ago. Ages. Close to the planet Sense Sphere. Let's widen out. The year 4126. That is the Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire.
It's good, isn't it?
Bit full. But you see, the Empire stretches out across three galaxies.
Yeah. That thing about the bees is odd.
Sometimes I wonder.
Ood distribution centres.
Back to the point.
What do you mean? What circle?
I've had enough of the schmoozing. Do you fancy going off the beaten track?
Yeah.
Last time I met the Ood, I never thought. I never asked.
I was busy. So busy I couldn't save them. I had to let the Ood die. I reckon I owe them one.
Let's keep out of his way. Come on.
Where'd you learn to whistle?
Ood export. You see? Lifts up the containers, takes them to the rocket sheds, ready to be flown out all over the three galaxies.
What do you think?
Hundred? More?
It's not so different from your time.
Who do you think made your clothes?
Sorry.
Ood, tell me. Does the circle mean anything to you?
But what is it? What is the circle?
Why?
Oh, that's us. Come on.
Where've you gone?
Donna? Where are you?
If you don't do what she says, you're really in trouble. Not from me, from her.
There we go, safe and sound.
Solana, the Ood aren't born like this. They can't be. A species born to serve could never evolve in the first place. What does the company do to make them obey?
Oh, what, because you don't ask?
Where's he? What part of the complex? I could help with the red eye. Now show me.
Come with me. You've seen the warehouse. You can't agree with all this. You know this place better than me. You could help.
This way.
Oh, can you hear it? I didn't need the map. I should have listened.
Listen. Listen, listen, listen, listen.
Oh, my head.
Can't you hear it? The singing?
That's because they're natural born Ood, unprocessed, before they're adapted to slavery. Unspoilt. That's their song.
Do you want to?
It's the song of captivity.
Face me.
Open your mind. That's it. Hear it, Donna. Hear the music.
Sure?
It's okay.
All the time.
Ah, let them.
What are you holding? Show me. Friend. Doctor, Donna. Friend. Let me see. Look at me. Let me see. That's it. That's it, go on. Go on.
It's a brain. A hind brain. The Ood are born with a secondary brain. Like the amygdala in humans, it processes memory and emotions. You get rid of that, you wouldn't be Donna any more. You'd be like an Ood. A processed Ood.
And they stitch on the translator.
What you going to do, then? Arrest me? Lock me up? Throw me in a cage? Well, you're too late. Ha!
If that's what Friends Of The Ood are trying to prove, then yes.
That's because you can't hear them.
Oh, nice one.
You're going to gas them?.
What's happening?
But Mister Halpen, there's something else, isn't there? Something we haven't seen.
A creature couldn't survive with a separate forebrain and hind brain, they'd be at war with themselves. There's got to be something else, a third element, am I right?
But it's got to be connected to the red eye. What is it?
Come on.
These are really good handcuffs.
Doctor, Donna, friends.
Doctor, Donna, friends.
Doctor, Donna, friends.
Friends, friends, friends.
Yes. That's us. Friends. Oh, yes.
I don't know where it is. I don't know where they've gone.
It might be underground, like some sort of cave, or a cavern, or
All right?
The Ood Brain. Now it all makes sense, That's the missing link. The third element, binding them together. Forebrain, hind brain, and this, the telepathic centre. It's a shared mind, connecting all the Ood in song.
Those pylons.
Damping the telepathic field. Stopping the Ood from connecting for two hundred years.
Maybe it's taken centuries to adapt. The subconscious reaching out?
What is that stuff?
Oh, dear.
Funny thing, the subconscious. Takes all sorts of shapes. Came out in the red eye as revenge, came out in the rabid Ood as anger, and then there was patience. All that intelligence and mercy, focused on Ood Sigma. How's the hair loss, Mister Halpen?
Oh, they've been preparing you for a very long time. And now you're standing next to the Ood Brain, Mister Halpen, can you hear it? Listen.
Yep.
I noticed.
It's better that way. People who know for certain tend to be like Mister Halpen.
Oh!
That's better. And now, Sigma, would you allow me the honour?
Oh, yes! Stifled for two hundred years, but not any more. The circle is broken. The Ood can sing.
The message has gone out. That song resonated across the galaxies. Everyone heard it. Everyone knows. The rockets are bringing them back. The Ood are coming home.
Oh, I've, I've sort of got a song of my own, thanks.
Meaning?
Yeah. Er, what about you? You still want to go home?
Then we'll be off.
Always.

No.
Why do you always assume I'm lying?
No.
Soon.
No.
Yes.
He and I've known each other a long time.
An enemy's just a friend you don't really know yet. Sorry. What, was that me being cynical again?
That's different. I don't like you!
You know who to give that to?
I won't go straight away. I'll hang out for a bit. Probably meditate on a rock somewhere. Get myself ready.
You could say that about being born.
Look after the universe for me. I've put a lot of work into it.
How many days have I been here?
Three hours?
Maybe Clara's right. She keeps telling me I've got Attention Deficit er something or other.
You can't come with me, Bors.
I didn't save your life. You had a splinter.
Someone I know is very sick. He'll want to see me before (pause) while there's still time.
Someone I've known a very long time.
You can't help me, not where I'm going. I have to get myself ready. I have to be alone. I have to think. No more distractions.
Urgh. Hang on a minute. (stands up) The water.
I don't like it. I can't meditate properly without decent water.
We're going to dig a well! Right on, er, this spot. There will be excellent water here.
Oh, I'm very good at water.
This is definitely a good spot for water.
Well, twelve is my lucky number.
Here. No, here. Look at this grass. This is watery grass. Follow the squelchy.
Yes, I suppose it can. Except.
Do you know what this well really needs?
A visitor's centre.
Look at this coin. You see it?
Where is it now?
No, it isn't.
Are you sure? I'm really a very good magician.
Why would I dread anything?
I thought you were an idiot.
Good. I was worried I would have to break it to you
I've been avoiding it. One last night, then I have to go.
I have to prepare myself.
I did something wrong. I let somebody down when I should have been brave enough and strong enough to do better. Tomorrow I pay the price. Tonight, I make myself ready.
You do realise you're still an idiot.
Good. I have to be quiet now. Quiet as the grave.
Oh? Oh, well, we'll see about that, shall we?
No more distractions. Got to focus. No more distractions. Bors!
Are you any good with a broadsword?
Fancy a friendly?
(standing) I suppose I do owe you.
Yes. Yes, you have.
Well, a little while ago, a very long way from here, I was looking for a bookshop. Instead, I found a battlefield. Story of my life. I've seen many battlefields. But this one will be different. This one will be my last.
Your chances of survival are about one in a thousand. So here's what you do. You forget the thousand, and you concentrate on the one. Pick it up. I said, pick it up!
I'm straight ahead of you, about fifty feet. Can you see me?
The device in your hand is creating an acoustic corridor, so that we can talk. Do you understand?
Oh, I'm just a passer-by. I was looking for a bookshop. How do you think I'm doing?
No, this is a war. A very old one, going by the mix of technology. Which war is this? I get them all muddled up.
Where am I? What planet is this?
Well, neither do I. I try never to understand. It's called an open mind. Now,
Yes, you have got to decide that you're going to live. Survival is just a choice. Choose it now.
I told you, you have one chance in a thousand. But one is all you ever need. What's your name? Come on, faith in the future. Introduce yourself! Tell me the name of the boy who isn't going to die today.
You said you wanted an axe fight.
Oh, come on. In a few hundred years, that'll be really funny. It's a slow burner.
Yes, and a daffodil is not a broadsword, but I still won the last round!
What do you think of my tank? Don't worry, it isn't loaded.
No, neither do I. I bought it for my fish.
I may have ordered online!
Oh, come on. Fish? Tank? Honestly, this stuff will be hilarious in a very few hundred years. Do please stick around.
Now, you lot. I have been here all day, and it's been a great day!
Three weeks? It must be nearly bedtime. Well, we've partied.
Yes! I helped you dig a well, with a first-class, child-friendly visitor's centre! I've given you some top-notch maths tuition in a fun but relevant way. And I have also introduced the word "dude" several centuries early. Let me hear you!
Are you a Renaissance?
Are you a Medieval?
I am a dragon-slaying?
We are all the young?
I like it. But I've got some sad news for you, dudes. Tonight, I'm going to have to leave you.
But before I do, I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of mine.
When do I not see you?
There was a crowd, too?
Well, you know what they say. Hugging is a great way to hide your face.
I spent all day yesterday in a bow tie, the day before in a long scarf. It's my party, and all of me is invited.
It's the wicked stepmother! Everyone hiss!
Well, I've got some good news about that.
It's still today!
Bors. Is it a marble again? Did you swallow one of the marbles I gave you? Don't swallow marbles!
Says you and whose army?
Nobody dies here. Not one person, not one of my friends, do you understand?
So I hear.
Then you will harm nobody in this place. Not one person. Are we very, very clear?
You want to know how dangerous I am? Davros sent
Is that supposed to frighten me? Snake nest in a dress? Now, explain, politely. Davros is my arch-enemy. Why would I want to talk to him?
Hush!
Er, it was.
I don't have a screwdriver any more.
Is your ship in orbit?
I am prepared.
Yes. Goodbye. (sotto) Goodbye, Clara.
No! No, no, no. Under no circumstances! What are you doing now?
No, no, no! I forbid it, no! No! No! No! No!
Davros is the child of war, a war that wouldn't end. A thousand years of fighting, till nobody could remember why. So Davros, he created a new kind of warrior, one that wouldn't bother with
How scared must you be to seal every one of your own kind inside a tank? (a pause) Davros made the Daleks, but who made Davros?
So that's where he ended up.
I don't know. A hospital?
Who knows? It's always the way with hospitals.
Well, we've known each other a long time. She's one of my own people.
I'm sorry.
(sotto) Gravity.
Davros.
Clearly.
I still do.
If you had created a virus in your laboratory
I'm not here as your prisoner, Davros...
Unimaginable power! Unlimited rice pudding!
Everything we saw. Everything we lost.
But did you bother to tell anyone they might be eating their own relatives?
Yes, yes, yes, okay, you've made your point.
If someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you, and told you that that child would grow up totally evil, to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives, could you then kill that child?
I get the point.
You flatter me.

It ended in the Time War.
No!
Skaro! You've brought me to Skaro.
(sotto) Clara!
What are they going to do? Tell me, what?
(sotto) Don't. Just don't.
(sotto) No. Missy, no!
Please! Please, I'm begging you. Please, please. Please, save Clara.
(sotto) Oh, Clara. Oh, my Clara.
Why have I ever let you live?
From the future.
I'm going to save my friend the only way I can.
Exterminate!

Ah.
Ah!
I had a passing fancy. Only it didn't pass, it stopped.
Thirtieth Olympiad.
Only seems like yesterday a few naked Greek blokes were tossing a discus about, wrestling each other in the sand with crowds stood around baying. No, wait a minute, that was Club Med. Just in time for the opening doo dah, ceremony, tonight, I thought you'd like that. Last one they had in London was dynamite. Wembley, 1948. I loved it so much, I went back and watched it all over again. Fella carrying the torch. Lovely chap, what was his?
Mark? John? Mark? Legs like pipe cleaners, but strong as a whippet.
And in those days, everybody had a tea party to go to.
Did you ever have one of those little cakes with the crunchy ball bearings on top?
Do you know those things? Nobody else in this entire galaxy's ever even bothered to make edible ball bearings. Genius.
What's taking them, do you think? Snatching children from a thoroughly ordinary street like this. Why's it so cold? Is someone reducing the temperature?
What makes you think it's a person?
Ooo, tickles!
My er. Snakes and Ladders? Quite good at squash. Reasonable. I'm being facetious, aren't I. There's no call for it.
I'm, I'm a police officer! That's what I am. I've got a badge and a police car. You don't have to get. I can, I can prove it. Just hold on.
See, look. I've got a colleague. Lewis.
Training. New recruit. It was either that or hairdressing, so, voila!
Why don't we
I'm of the opinion that all we've got to do is just
I think we need to just
Fingers on lips!
In the last six days, three of your children have been stolen. Snatched out of thin air, right?
Can you smell it? What does it remind you of?
Mmm hmm.
Danny Edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other. Whoa, there it goes again! Look at the hairs on the back of my manly hairy hand.
There's a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished. Whatever it was, it used an awful lot of power to do this.
Thanks! I'm experimenting with back combing. Oh.
No, I'm not really a cat person. Once you've been threatened by one in a nun's wimple, it kind of takes the joy out of it.
Whoa! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Ion residue. Blimey! That takes some doing. Just to snatch a living organism out of space-time. This baby is just like, I'm having some of that. I'm impressed.
It can harness huge reserves of ionic power. We need to find the source of that power. Find the source and you will find whatever has taken to stealing children and fluffy animals. See what you can see. Keep them peeled, Lewis.
Stay still!
Okey dokey?
No probs. I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me what the hell it is, because I haven't got the foggiest.
It was never living. It's animated by energy. Same energy that's snatching people. That is so dinky! The go anywhere creature. Fits in your pocket, makes friends, impresses the boss, breaks the ice at parties.
Oh, hi ho, here we go. Let's have a look. Get out of here.
It is. It's graphite. Basically the same material as an HB pencil.
Scribble creature, brought into being with ionic energy. Whatever we're dealing with, it can create things as well as take them. But why make a scribble creature?
Probably.
Of course! What girl?
Are you deducting?
Copper's hunch?
Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Rose. Can we see your daughter?
Okay. Bye.
Well, there's some interesting stuff going on in this street, and I just thought. Well, we thought, that she might like to give us a hand.
Yeah, sorry. We'll let you get on with things. On your own. Bye again.
Yes, I can.
Well, let's go and say hi.
Why are you afraid of her, Trish?
I'm sure she is.
All right, there? I'm the Doctor.
How're you doing, Chloe Webber?
But you've been drawing, though. I'm rubbish. Stick men about my limit. Can do this, though.
Can you do that?
Who don't?
Come on, Chloe. Don't be a spoil sport. What's the big project? I'm dying to know. What're you making up there?
No, ta.
Tell us about the drawings, Chloe.
Yes, you have, out of the corner of your eye.
And you dismissed it, because what choice do you have when you see something you can't possibly explain? You dismiss it, right? And if anyone mentions it, you get angry, so it's never spoken of, ever again.
You're terrified of her. But there's nowhere to turn to, because who's going to believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye? No one. Except me.
I'm help.
Ionic energy. Chloe's harnessing it to steal those kids and place them in some kid of holding pen made up of ionic power.
If living things can become drawings, then maybe drawings can become living things. Chloe's real dad is dead, but not the one who visits her in her nightmares. That dad seems very real. That's the dad she's drawn and he's a heartbeat away from crashing into this world.
Let's find out.
Nice one.
There we go.
Now we can talk.
Who are you?
I'm speaking to you, the entity that is using this human child. I request parley in compliance with the Shadow Proclamation.
So what do you care about?
You're lonely, I know. Identify yourself.
Name yourself!
You're Isolus. Of course.
The Isolus Mother, drifting in deep space. See, she jettisons millions of fledgling spores. Her children. The Isolus are empathic beings of intense emotions, but when they're cast off from their mother, their empathic link, their need for each other, is what sustains them. They need to be together. They cannot be alone.
The Isolus children travel, each inside a pod. They ride the heat and energy of solar tides. It takes thousands and thousands of years for them to grow up.
While they travel, they play games. They use their ionic power to literally create make believe worlds in which to play.
Helps keep them happy. While they're happy, they can feed off each others love. Without it, they're lost. Why did you come to Earth?
That's a solar flare from your sun. Would have made a tidal wave of solar energy that scattered the Isolus pods.
Your pod crashed. Where is it?
You empathised with her. You wanted to be with her because she was alone like you.
I understand. You want to make a family. But you can't stay in this child. It's wrong. You can't steal any more friends for yourself.
Trish, how do you calm her?
When she has nightmares, what do you do?
What do you do?
Then start singing.
Her and the Isolus. Two lonely kids who need each other.
It's desperate to be loved. It's used to a pretty big family.
Say around four billion?
We need that pod.
Well, it's been sucking in all the heat it can. Hopefully that should keep it in a fit state to launch. It must be close. It should have a weak energy signature that the Tardis can trace. Once we find it, then we can stop the Isolus.
We can scan for the same trace that I picked up from the scribble creature. We'd need to widen the field a bit.
I know what it's like to travel a long way on your own. Give me the styner-magnetic. The thing in your left hand.
I sympathise, that's all.
It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe. Two lonely mixed up kids.
It's scared. Come on, you were a kid once. Binary dot.
Gum.
What about trying to understand them?
I was a dad once.
I think we're there. Fear, loneliness. They're the big ones, Rose. Some of the most terrible acts ever committed have been inspired by them. We're not dealing with something that wants to conquer or destroy. There's a lot of things you need to get across this universe. Warp drive, wormhole refractors. You know the thing you need most of all? You need a hand to hold.
It's the pod! It is in the street. Everything's coming up Doctor.
Okay. It's about two inches across. Dull grey, like a gull's egg. Very light.
Go on. Join your brothers and sisters. They'll be waiting.
Top banana. Mmm. I can't stress this enough. Ball bearings you can eat, masterpiece!
Nah. Not on a night like this. This is a night for lost things being found. Come on.
I want to go to the Games. It's what we came for.
Well, I will tell you this. Papua New Guinea surprises everyone in the shot put.
Wait and see.
Never say never ever.
There's something in the air. Something coming.
A storm's approaching.

I'm afraid you're wasting your time, Jamie.
Unless I'm very much mistaken, these creatures are so big they're going to see us long before we see them.
Go on, Ben.
Where we are? Well, according to my calculations we're certainly in the future and on a planet very like the Earth.
I don't know. I'm guessing.
Oh, thank you.
Not too tight. It's bad for the blood pressure.
Well, it was nothing. Anyone would have done the same. Well this is gay. Why all the music?
Oh.
I feel perfectly all right as I am, thank you.
Please get me out of here. I'm done to a turn.
My clothes don't need reviving.
Oh, my shoes!
Precisely. Who wants to see their face in a pair of suede shoes? What's this one?
Exactly what I need. Full on!
Oh. Oh, I feel better. Oh, that's more like it.
There you are. I wondered what had happened to you.
Do you belong here?
What? Oh, no. No, its all right, thank you. I just thought I'd dropped something, that's all.
I'm going to set you free. Just hold still a minute. There we are. One more. Don't bother to say thank you. Now, tell me something about these things that you see. Do they, for instance, appear to crawl slowly over the ground?
Oh, just wondered, that's all.
I don't hear anything.
It's all right, I won't let them hurt you.
Why don't you listen to me?
I told him he wouldn't get hurt and he wouldn't believe me.
Well, no, not exactly.
There's something else you forgetting, gentlemen. I set free someone that we caught in the first place.
He can run, you know. He's got legs. He doesn't have to crawl over the ground.
No reason. No reason at all.
Oh. Oh, that's where Medok lives, is it?
Oh. Well, thank you.
Yes, but what do you do?
I saw you.
Oh, that's not very polite. I was interested in what you were saying.
No one. Why should I tell them? Now, these creatures. Have you seen them clearly? What do they look like?
But I'm interested. What do they look like?
With big claws?
You've seen them in the Colony?
Has anyone else seen them?
Why do they do that?
Were you looking for me? I was just looking around, that's all.
Oh, I'm used to the dark. I like it.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm sure I will. Thank you. Goodnight.
Same to you.
It's all right. It's me. Stay where you are.
Don't move.
Wait. If he comes in this way, we go out the back. If he comes in the back way, we'll go out ahead here.
All right, go back.
I'll try to create a diversion.
Do as I tell you.
Go on. Go on. All right, we'll go through this opening when I give the word. Right, now.
I don't see anything.
Medok. The guards, they'll hear you.
Medok.
Yes, I think I can confirm.
Well, it might be as well to
I just thought I'd go and have a look.
What will they do to us?
Reason's the last thing a man like Ola will listen to.
Good evening, Pilot. Oh, what a very nice office you have here.
Well, I
Oh, forgive me. This is interesting. A telescopic viewing machine. I imagine you can keep track on the entire Colony from here and direct intercommunication between all parts. Very up to date, I imagine. Excellent, excellent. And what
A crime?
I'm not so sure, Pilot.
Ah, that's the point. Does he?
Let me perhaps explain.
I hope you're not going to listen to everything that Medok tells you?
Well, in his state of mind he might say anything.
Perfectly all right, thank you.
Ah.
Well, as a matter of fact
Yes. Thank you, Medok. I quite understand.
What will happen to Medok?
Why do you want everyone to be the same?
Not at all. Thank you. Goodnight.
Wake up, Polly.
I've been scotching a rumour. Or should I say scorching.
Polly, I think you've been listening to some very bad advice.
Yes, I know you have. Fast asleep. Very fast asleep. Polly, do you smell anything? A sort of sweet perfume?
Never mind. Now, Polly, I want you to forget everything that you've been dreaming.
Well, it's just possible that you've been given a series of orders while you've been asleep. You know, do this, do that, do the other thing. My advice to you is don't do anything of the sort. Don't just be obedient. Always make up your own mind. What am I thinking of? Ben and Jamie!
No, not yet, but nearly so.
Well, by my calculations, there should be a thin strand of wire in the wall here, like a nerve tapping the subconscious of the human brain.
It should be here somewhere. Ah!
Better some damage than loss of will power.
What law?
Jamie, how did you sleep?
That's a good sign. That means they haven't been able to get very deeply into your brain.
I'll show you. Watch this.
I'm very much afraid I'm too late.
No, it's no use, Jamie. JAMIE: But we cannot let him go, Doctor. DOCTOR: You'll have to. Violence will get you nowhere. POLLY: Doctor, he's going to go and tell the guards. We've got to get you out of here. DOCTOR: We can't leave Ben.
You'll have to. Violence will get you nowhere. POLLY: Doctor, he's going to go and tell the guards. We've got to get you out of here. DOCTOR: We can't leave Ben.
We can't leave Ben.
No, no, not Ben. He's not in control of his actions. He's been given a series of instructions and he can't help himself.
Thank you, Jamie, but I'd better go with Captain Ola.
Rather neat, don't you think? And so simple. I did it with this.
I'm proud of it.
My dear Pilot, your wall? Even you are subjected to this form of subconscious control?
That's better.
The least you can do is to say thank you.
Polly? Polly? What's the matter?
Don't blame him, Polly.
I told you. Ben has come under control of the evil forces at the heart of this colony.
Who is Control?
Have I? I don't remember.
Why don't you show him to us then?
That set the cat among the pigeons.
Oh!
Dreadful. Did you hear that rhyme? The man who wrote that ought to be sent to the Danger Gang, not us.
Yes, you might call us that.
What an extremely remarkable place. What efficiency. Whatever do you make?
Old? What do you mean old? I'm not old, Jamie.
But it's much safer up here. Isn't it, Medok?
Ah. I see. I'm perfectly capable of working in the pit, thank you. Polly can have the safe job.
Well, I'm not sure I understand all this machinery myself.
What do you mean? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes, I'll be supervisor.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
But would have liked a mask.
This really is remarkable. Most interesting. Yes, I suppose with a little adjustment. Hello, Ben. Don't go. Come in. Don't be afraid.
No, of course not. It wasn't your fault you betrayed your friends.
The voices may not be right, Ben.
Yes, I know. That's why you're here, isn't it? To spy on me. What does Control want to know this time? Can't you answer me? You know, Ben, this is very unlike you.
It's hard for you to struggle against the voices, isn't it, Ben? But I warn you, if you spy on the others, watch out Jamie doesn't catch you. He's not so tolerant as I am.
Yes. Now, one must assume that the relative connection is constant. Now, let me see. Ah. Yes, I think that's right. I shall give myself ten out of ten.
Oh, you did give me a turn.
What?
In my head. You know.
And you're one of them, I'd say.
It does seem rather a tall order.
I wouldn't know how to do that. Take a look.
Really? Huh. In that case
Well, I did have a little assistance.
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No. I simply mean that I took readings from the various dials. They appeared to be related, so I worked out the principle that controlled them. It was simple really. Like doing a sum backwards.
Yes. You know. Given the answer, what's the question?
Oh well, if you insist.
Oh, there now. If anyone follows that formula there'll be an almighty explosion. X to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6!
But, if no one can escape
They seem very emphatic about that.
But what if your prisoner escapes that way? What will happen to you?
Well, aren't you going to do something about it?
Who has escaped, anyway?
How do you know that, Ben?
And you didn't report it?
Why not?
Ben, you're recovering. I always thought you were a tough customer. Well done.
You don't seem very sure.
Yes. Jamie's got free. By my calculations he's got a very good chance. Hold that for me, will you?
Well, as I understand it, Jamie's in the old shaft.
And for reasons of their own, Control don't want anyone there. It's forbidden territory.
I don't know. I'll be able to tell you when I've tested this to see how lethal it is.
On this planet it's got a lot to do with everybody. There now. Yes.
I'm trying to analyse this gas, and I'm not having very much luck.
Yes. And they go to great efforts to get it. The question is why?
Oh! Mustn't find this.
They're going to pour this gas in the old shaft. Gas they value above all else. What do you make of that, Polly?
Don't you see? Control are not pouring this poisonous gas into the old shaft to kill Jamie. They've quite another reason.
Before we act, we must think. Now, the Macra that have come to the surface of this planet have not found sufficient gas in the atmosphere, so they've had to get somebody to pump it up from down below.
That's obvious, Polly, obvious. Because there's something trapped down there they wish to keep alive.
I'm doing my best, Polly. I'm thinking at top speed. There's a pattern involved here, a combination of pipes. If one were to follow this one
Seven and eleven. Now which are they?
Seven and eleven. If that's the system in use, it must go from here round up to there.
Polly, I think I've found the gas flow.
Let me see, let me see.
I hate to think. It won't be anything very pleasant. Polly, go and see what the first dial on the control desk registers.
Hurry up.
Full pressure. And the other one? Come on.
Zero. Now I think there's only one thing for it. Plus must be made minus and minus must be made plus.
The question is, which is plus and which is minus?
Oh, just checking.
As you please. But I think you're going to run into trouble.
Well, according to my calculations, the pressure gauges are wrong.
Ridiculous? Well, that's as may be. But, after all, three times three is nine, and if you divide by half of its own cubic capacity to the formula Pi over four squared, I think you'll have to agree with me.
Why not?
Oh. So these are the inflow pipes, are they? That's all I wanted to know.
Inflow. Inflow. Outflow. Inflow. High pressure. Low pressure and O-U-T spells out.
It's all right, Polly, confusion is best left to the experts.
Oh yes, I have. I can stand an operation on its head quicker than anyone. There! I think you'll find I've revolutionised the entire gas flow of the Colony.
Polly, see what those dials register now.
What does it read?
And the other one?
Good. Splendid. That means there'll be a fine old gale of fresh air blowing along the old shaft any time now.
Yes, I'm sure it is. But I'm sure you'd like a little help.
It's all right, Polly, I've got his keys. Lock the door.
Yes, well, the later the better. The only thing we can do for Jamie now is to give him time. Lock the door.
Oh, dear. Your keys. Try in your pocket. Or on the gantry. Or over there.
Come on, Polly. Let's get out of here.
It's locked.
Push, Polly, push!
You've got to. Come on, together. I've nearly got it locked. There we are.
Well, it looks rather like a cupboard with a lot of pipes.
They must lead somewhere. Let's have a look.
Yes, very likely.
Stay here? I'm not spending the rest of my life with a lot of old pipes.
Now, come along Polly. I'm sure there's no need to be afraid. Well, well I think there's no need to be afraid. Oh, come on. Let's find out.
Shh. I hear voices. Very faint.
Stay here a minute, Polly.
Yes, just as I thought. These creatures would die without it.
I couldn't tell you when they were here in the first place, Polly. They're like germs in the human body. They've got into the body of this colony. They're living as parasites.
Polly, that's what I think they are.
Yes, very likely.
Now then. One system must provide them with the gas they need, and the other one must be an outflow.
Yes, Polly. I think it might work.
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Well, everyone is up bright and early. And the last two strangers are not missing after all. Oh, come now. We can't have bad temper and differences of opinion in this happy type colony. Say you're sorry, Ola. Say you're sorry, Pilot.
Good morning, Jamie. It's nice to see you so well cared for.
Oh, it's all right. I've just come in to have a word with my old friend, the Pilot. Good morning, Ben. I hope you're feeling more your old self?
Of course not. You can't arrest us now we've given ourselves up. That's against the rules.
Yes, I do, urgently. Come with me.
Pilot.
That was a very brave thing to do.
Come with me.
Yes and you'll soon see why.
Bad laws were made to be broken. Follow me.
Oh, perhaps I've got an honest face.
Don't give up now. It's just up here.
There you are. That's what's taken over this Colony. You haven't been in touch with Control, but with these. They've used this Colony for their own ends, destroying you to live themselves.
Let's go.
I don't know, but you must fight them.
Take full command!
Well, you see what Control really is.
I don't know. We must be ready for anything.
Pilot, do you know where it's coming from?
There must be a hidden inlet.
Polly, hold that in front of your mouth.
I think you're right, Jamie.
Polly!
Ben? Is that you? Are you all right?
No.
Ben, listen.
We've got very little time. It's all up to you.
Go to the control desk, and you'll see two switches, one marked outflow and one marked inflow.
Good. You see a lever in front of them?
Switch on both inflow and outflow.
Switch them on, Ben. Then stand by to throw the lever.
Throw the lever away from you.
Relax. Relax. More haste, more waste. Pleasure is beautiful.
Oh, well.
They can't do that to me. Let's get out of here.
Take a leaf out of Jamie's book. Give them the old dance routine.

Well, I'm trying to reactivate the Tardis' Time Vector Generator.
Well, it could sent you into the future, if it starts working again. Particularly if you're standing there.
Liz! Good grief!
Oh, there you are.
Well, we both got caught in the time warp field and were projected into the future.
Yes, but only about fifteen seconds.
No, no, no. You vanished first. I only seemed to have vanished because you went into the future and I wasn't there yet.
Yes.
Oh. Wretched thing seems to have packed up again. Still, we're on the right lines.
Look.
Good gracious. Lethbridge Stewart. What on Earth's he doing at Space Control?
Oh, and the Brigadier thinks it's his business. Oh well, I suppose he's got to do something to occupy his mind now that he's blown up the Silurians.
They've just linked up.
No, not a sound.
That sound. I've heard it somewhere before.
That's just it. I can't remember!
Don't you understand? It's all up here in my mind. The information's here, but I can't reach it. We'd better go there.
The Space Centre. It's not far.
My dear fellow, I simply don't happen to have a pass! Because I don't believe in them, that's why.
Take your hands off me, sir. Ah, there you are.
That sound. Have you heard it again?
You will.
Have you got a recording of that message?
Quite right. Neither have I. Now, that sound, have you got a recording of it?
No, they haven't. There's nothing anybody can do for the time being.
Now you listen to me. That sound was some kind of a message, and it's going to be repeated.
Nonsense, man. You're doing nothing of the sort. There's nothing you can possibly do
High frequency accelerated impulses. Now then, I shall need multi copies of that recording, unlimited computer time and somewhere to work. Miss Shaw, I shall need your help.
By exercising my intelligence. Now, since we didn't reply, the message would obviously be repeated. Now, we've got to break down that code and answer them.
The man's a fool! How can I possibly tell who the message is from until I know what it says? Let me explain this to you in very simple terms.
Might find me useful?
Yes. Yes, of course. Look, my dear fellow, do please forgive this intrusion, but you really must let me decode those messages. It could prove of vital importance to the safety of your astronauts.
No, not now.
That was the reply. Brigadier, I shall need worldwide triangulation immediately.
The first ones, yes, but not that last one. That was completely different. Now we've got to find out where that was coming from.
The message was repeated. Perhaps the reply will be. All we can do now is wait.
And Algonquin.
Arecibo.
Cambridge.
Oh, that's good.
Well, if it's from Earth, this could give us the country, but that's not accurate enough. We must pinpoint the exact location.
Something coming through.
Yes. London.
Can I get a map of London on this thing?
A map of London. It's very important.
Useless gadgets.
What's the exact location?
Look, if I'm to help you people, I need full cooperation.
I specified the need for computer time. If I'm to decode those messages, I need a computer.
Yes, so he's just informed me. But he's being totally non-cooperative.
Yes.
Let's see what he's got to say for himself this time.
Do you realise the importance of it?
So, you understood the message.
What are you going to do with it?
Since you insist. (The Doctor holds out the reel, which disappears just before Taltalian can take it.)
Careful, Brigadier. He's frightened.
Yes, of course.
Are you all right?
I think we can safely leave him to the Brigadier.
What?
Oh, the tape.
Oh, here it is here.
No, no, no. No, that was simply transmigration of object. There's a great deal of difference between that and pure science, you know. Now then, what about decoding this tape? Let me see now.
Yes. Yes, that's just what I was looking for.
Oh, thank you.
Brigadier, what did you find at the warehouse?
And?
Well, I'd like to have a talk with him.
Why don't you sit down, old chap?
Now, you were under orders not to harm the Brigadier, weren't you? Who gave you those orders?
Anything found on him?
Clothes?
You've been very thorough, haven't you.
Don't you realise that the men you are working with were seriously interfering with our space project, and thereby endangering the lives of three astronauts.
Brigadier, you're wasting your time.
Yes, I know, but he's not going to tell us and I think we've got more important things to do.
Looking after you all right, are they? Have you had a cup of tea?
That's good. Stand to attention when you're talking to me and call me sir!
Just as I thought. Sergeant, aren't you?
No, he's acting under orders.
Still no word from them?
Well, that's it for now. I'd better go and see how Liz is getting on with the decoding.
No, no. No, if they're going to attempt a re-entry they must make at least one Earth's orbit. I'll be back in time for re-entry. Are you coming?
Yes. There's no pattern to it at all. It's nonsense!
Yes.
Wonder what?
Never mind all that. Ask it what two and two make.
Liz, ask it.
How long have you known Doctor Taltalian?
Oh, it's typical. I never did trust those stupid things.
No, no. No, they always lose radar contact in the last few seconds.
Well done, old chap. Well done.
They've locked it from the inside?
Take it back to the Space Centre?
All right.
I'm afraid I can't.
Yes, well, if you want me to get out of the way, I'm afraid you'll have to help me. Old Bessie seems to have stopped.
Ready? I'll let the brake off. Right, push.
Thank you very much! Don't worry, it'll switch itself off. Eventually.
I brought it here.
Didn't you find two angry men stuck to my car?
Can't have got that force field strong enough yet.
Thank you. Hello? Yes, Liz. Yes, right. I'll be down straight away. I'll tell you all about it later. Liz thinks she's on to something.
You're right, Liz. This is a definite attempt at pictographic communication.
What, with this symbol repeated twice? And this one repeated four times? Oh, no.
No one on this world, but an alien intelligence so different this is the only way they can communicate.
I think that it's high time the Brigadier and I had a talk to the top man.
I should have thought that was obvious. Every step we take, someone's ahead of us.
Look, that is quite beside the point. The question is, who else is involved?
Oh, yes, we've got the capsule back all right, and it's safely installed at the Space Centre. But the astronauts still refuse to come out.
Is that all you've got to say, Sir James? Sweep it all under the carpet?
Any response yet?
Let me try. Hello, Van Lyden? What is the capital of Australia?
How many beans make five?
Van Lyden!
Right, cut it open!
What? Let me see.
Liz, try them again.
Well, well, well. A tape recording.
Well, someone wanted us to believe they were still inside there. That tape recorder's not a standard part of their equipment, is it?
Then somebody put it there, didn't they?
Well, to gain time. Now, suppose the astronauts were still in there when it landed, and later they were removed.
I take it you didn't order this.
Well, there you are then. A bogus patrol turns up, clears the area, and removes the astronauts at their leisure.
Yes, perhaps the same people who replied to that message.
Yes, I'll come with you.
Yes? What is it?
I don't think you can sweep all this under the Ministry carpet, Sir James. Someone in authority has done this.
We haven't come here to offer explanations, Sir James, we've come to demand them. From you.
You mean you're going to tell us the truth?
Oh.
Does that include sending coded messages to Mars Probe 7? And kidnapping three astronauts?
Yes, but why all this extraordinary behaviour? Well, surely radiation is a normal hazard of space travel?
Well, it seems to have been a question of the right hand fighting the left, doesn't it, Brigadier?
Well, it hasn't eased mine.
I should like to take a look at these mysteriously irradiated astronauts for myself, if I may.
Nevertheless, I would still like to see them.
Perfectly safe, were they?
Liz, what were those exact radiation figures again?
Thank you.
Possibly.
I realise the importance very well, General Carrington. That is why I must be allowed to continue my work undisturbed.
Oh, thanks. You know, it's the most extraordinary thing. Those astronauts were emitting radiation like walking reactors.
Yes. I know.
Well, I can tell you where your three astronauts are.
They're still in orbit.
No, you saw three spacesuits. I don't know what came down in Recovery 7, but it certainly wasn't human.
I do.
I should do that as quickly as possible, if I were you.
Must you?
And why do you think that is?
It's the most extraordinary thing. The radioactive contamination has almost vanished. If you can't get Recovery 8 ready in time, you can use this capsule.
Who's it from?
How very morbid.
No, I'm going to stay and get this capsule fully operational.
You're back soon.
But Liz has just gone to meet you. We received a message asking us to join you. You didn't send it?
Anyone can buy a foreign newspaper, General.
Let me look.
Very remiss of them, keeping this.
And hair combs.
I've told you where your astronauts are, General. They're still in orbit.
Is it? When your Professor Heldorf had the aliens in his care, he started to record some sort of radio communication impulses.
Then why didn't Heldorf talk to them?
Yes, well, I don't think so. Well, I'm going down to the Space Centre, use the computer. I trust your man Taltalian won't hold a gun on me this time?
General, how many times must I tell you, your astronauts are still in orbit. My objective is to find out what these aliens are trying to say to us.
You're not armed, I hope?
Thank you. I'm much relieved.
No, not yet. May I have the use of your computer?
I'd like to programme these impulse records, if I may.
Well if I knew, I wouldn't need a computer, would I?
Well, I suspect some sort of pattern.
Well, it mustn't, Taltalian, it mustn't.
Thank you. Hello? Yes? Yes, it is. Who is this?
My assistant, Liz Shaw.
No. Someone threatening to kill her if I don't stop interfering. Well, let's get back to work, shall we?
These impulses are mathematical formulae for building an electronic device.
I'll have to build it to find out, won't I?
Well, how are these people going to know what I'm doing unless somebody tells them?
You, for instance?
And you are being continually obstructive.
Did you? Or are you involved with the people who are really behind this?
The people who kidnapped Miss Shaw, who kidnapped the three astronauts.
No, not yet.
Well, I thought I'd offer you some sort of alternative. A ruthless investigation by the Brigadier, or a few quiet words with me and your name kept out of things.
I think you do, Taltalian, and I'm going to give you a little time to think it over. Right, well, if you'll excuse me, I must see what can be done about building this machine. Think over what I've said. I shall expect to hear from you very soon. (The Doctor leaves. Taltalian goes to a cupboard and takes out a palm-sized device.)
No, not a scrap.
Something even his computers don't have. Intuition. I think I rattled him.
Yes, I know, I heard him. And I didn't believe a word of it.
Well, first they try keeping us in the dark altogether and when that didn't work, they fall back on some prepared cover story. Contagious radiation, indeed.
I don't know. Perhaps I'll know better when I've built this device.
Advanced electronic equipment. I need it at once.
Good. I'll be in my laboratory. I suppose there's no news?
Mmm.
Yes, of course.
Is that all?
I'll take the rocket up for you myself.
My dear man, I've spent more time in space than any astronaut on your staff. Not, I'll admit, in the rather primitive contraptions that you use, but I'll manage.
I can also withstand considerably more G-force than most people, even though I do say so myself.
Tests, simulations, anything you like. When that recovery capsule is ready, I'll take it up.
I've saved you a journey, haven't I.
Have you thought over what I spoke to you about?
And?
Very well.
Yes, all right.
A lot of good it did me, and him.
I'm not sure that it was. Look at this. See this is set to zero. Taltalian must have thought that he had plenty of time to get away, when in fact this bomb was set to go off instantaneously.
Yes. Taltalian was a weak link, you know. I think his employers wanted him out of the way.
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Brigadier, look at this.
Well, it's something very similar to the machine I'm trying to build. And Taltalian had one all the time.
I tell you, it converts radio impulses into human speech. The aliens in Heldorf's Laboratory were trying to communicate with him.
I never believed they were. Now, if I can only build the other half of this thing.
Yes, probably, if you were to hurry up with those parts that I've ordered.
Thank you. Hello. Yes, Sir James?
Most certainly!
You might. If you were to tell me the truth, Sir James. The whole truth.
Very well, Sir James. Thank you. He wants me to come and see him. He says he's going to tell me the whole truth.
Sir James!
No, don't!
Brigadier, don't try and stop him.
Keep back, man, keep back!
There's no point in trying to follow him. There's nothing we can do.
Mmm?
Deflected by some sort of force field, I should think.
Not with bullets.
Somebody's using these creatures, Brigadier. They're not free agents. They were brought to Earth for some purpose.
Possibly. Or is that we are supposed to think?
What's the rate of fuel consumption?
Has that ever been done before?
Hasn't the death of Sir James Quinlan made things any easier for you?
Yes, well, don't let's bother about that for the time being.
Yes. Yes, I know. I told you everything would be all right.
What have you got against it?
All the more reason for me to go up in that rocket and find out what's happened up there.
You haven't answered mine. Why are you opposed to this launch?
Since we don't know what's up there, wouldn't it be more intelligent to carry a man rather than a bomb?
Then I suggest you take the matter up with his successor, when he's been appointed.
Right.
Well, there seems to be some sort of official opposition to my going. General Carrington's trying to stop the launch.
Right, I must be off.
Hello, Brigadier. What are you doing here?
What is this place?
Not very impressive for one's last sight of Earth, is it?
Goodbye, Brigadier. And thank you.
Yes. Yes, everything seems to be working all right.
How much longer have I got to wait in here?
I take it you mean half an hour. How's the fuel situation?
Well, can't you hurry it up?
Well, I still think you could add a higher proportion of M3. And remember, the extra G-force wouldn't worry me.
Ah.
Now what's the matter?
It's about time, too.
I can hear you. G-force hard to break.
I'll try.
No, there's no response. Must be the excess heat. Can you jettison stage one prematurely?
If you jettison stage one, there's a chance the excess momentum will put me into orbit.
It's better than going into orbit round the sun. Please jettison stage one now.
Thank you, Mister Cornish, I'm very much obliged.
Well, that seems to have done it. What went wrong, Mister Cornish?
They're very persistent, aren't they.
If you mean can I see it, the answer is no.
All right, all right. More haste less speed, Mister Cornish.
I see it. I see it. Manoeuvring for link-up now.
Well, I've linked up all right. Moving through into Mars Probe 7 now.
Nonsense man! Your three astronauts are in there. Injecting air into the tunnel now.
Some kind of space ship. It's enormous!
I'll try.
It's closing in too fast! I can't
Where am I?
What's happened to our three astronauts?
Very well.
What are you talking about?
Do you know where you are?
Please, do you know where you are?
You think you're on Earth, at the Space Centre?
I came to take you back to Earth.
Now, please listen to me. You're not on Earth nor are you at the Space Centre. You're prisoners in an alien spaceship.
You came up here in Recovery 7 but you never made the journey back. Something happened.
Yes.
Van Lyden?
You've conditioned their minds.
Why have you taken them prisoner?
Ambassadors?
Ambassadors!
What you tell me is appalling. The authorities on Earth had no knowledge of this.
Nevertheless, you must believe me. Now let me go back to Earth, and I will give you my personal assurance that your ambassadors will be returned to you.
From the information that you've given me, I'll find them. Now, please, you must let me try.
These three men, can I take them back with me?
Yes. Look, I'll see what I can do about getting you out of quarantine as soon as I possibly can.
Yes. Yes, all right. Don't worry. I'll look after everything.
Hello, Space Control? Can you hear me?
Yes, thank you.
Yes. They're safe and well. I'm not going to say any more at the moment, it's not safe.
I shall maintain radio silence until the necessary landing instructions.
Brigadier, put all your men on stand by. I shall explain everything to you when I land.
Right, I'm ready when you are.
Anything you say, Mister Cornish.
I'm none the better for your attentions. Liz?
Yes, and getting better by the minute. How are you? Did they hurt you at all?
Well, I don't blame you.
Ah, there they are.
Yes, I know. I've been aboard their spaceship. I've talked to their Captain.
They have some kind of translation machine.
Oh, no. No, that's a much simpler model. That would only receive one-way signals.
I dare say, if I had the proper equipment. I was going to build one. Never did get a chance to get round to it.
You expect me to help you?
Well, I shall need a lot of expensive equipment.
Very well. Thank you.
Is there a way out?
Right, let's get on with that list.
Well, if we can't get out to the Brigadier, we must bring the Brigadier to us.
I think the General knew all along.
Not particularly, no.
Then somebody disobeyed your instructions, didn't they.
Given the necessary equipment, yes.
It depends on what you're trying to do.
Liz! Well, General?
When do you expect this invasion?
They told me that their intentions were peaceful. That these three beings here were ambassadors.
You're convinced their intentions are hostile, then?
Ah, so that's when you met them. When you were on a previous Mars Probe.
Yes, but they didn't know their touch would kill human beings.
So it was you who sent for those three ambassadors, was it?
Was Sir James Quinlan in on this?
Well, I must say you've been very thorough, General.
Yes. Yes, I understand. You had to do what you had to do.
Yes. Yes, I'll build your machine for you.
Mmm hmm.
Look, I'm not building a crystal set, you know.
Look, if you let them out, how am I going to test it?
What, more killing?
Come on, Liz, let's get on with it. We haven't got much time, you know.
All right?
Right, switch on the power, Liz, will you?
All right? Right, let's try and test this thing.
(sotto) Well, I've boosted it as much as I possibly can. (normal) Just go over there, will you, Liz?
See if they react at all.
Any reaction?
Well, we'll just have to keep on trying, won't we.
Oh, we're just about to test it. Liz, you stand by the controls, will you?
Now, we are trying to convert our speech into your radio impulses. Can you understand me? We are trying to convert our human speech into your radio impulses. Can you understand me?
Can you understand me? Please try to answer.
Look, how many times must I tell you? I am not joining you in a programme of bank robbery.
What kept you?
What for?
We've got to stop him at once.
We've got to get in there somehow.
You know, I think he's right.
Now, we're going to return you to your own people, but first we need your help to prevent a catastrophe.
Open the gates. Please try not to harm anyone.
These aliens are invulnerable to your bullets. They will not harm you but you will die if you touch them. Now please, keep back.
Yes, General. I understand.
Please release that gentleman.
Right, Mister Cornish, we've got to get a message up to that alien space ship and tell them that their ambassadors are safe and well.
My dear chap, they're still up there. But don't worry, they're all right. They're quite safe. Now, we've got to make an exchange.
We'll send these three up in Recovery 7. They'll send down our three astronauts.
Well, simple. We'll use pure M3 variant. And don't forget, they're not susceptible to g-force.
Well goodbye, Mister Cornish. I've got a lot of work to do in my own laboratory.
Well, here you are. Here's Miss Shaw. She's much more practical than I am. Goodbye Brigadier.
(to aliens) Goodbye, gentlemen. Have a nice trip.

(static) No, sorry, I'm fine. Still here.
(feedback) Whoa. Careful! Anyway, it's both of us. Me and Ida. Hello. But the seal opened up. It's gone. All we've got left is this chasm.
Can't tell. It looks like it goes down forever.
No, no. No sign of the Beast.
Come on, Rose. Keep it
Together.
I think they've an order.
It said, I am the temptation.
Maybe we opened the prison but not the cell.
Oh. Oh, in a second, but then again, that is so human. Where angels fear to tread. Even now, standing on the edge. It's that feeling you get, eh? Right at the back of your head. That impulse. That strange little impulse. That mad little voice saying, go on. Go on. Go on. Go over. Go on. Maybe it's relying on that. For once in my life, Officer Scott, I'm going to say retreat. Oh, now I know I'm getting old. Rose, we're coming back.
What's strategy nine?
So we're going back to a slaughter?
If you are the Beast, then answer me this. Which one, hmm? Cos the universe has been busy since you've been gone. There's more religions than there are planets in the sky. The Archiphets, Orkology, Christianity, Pash Pash, New Judaism, San Klah, Church of the Tin Vagabond. Which devil are you?
What, then you're the truth behind the myth?
How did you end up on this rock?
When was this?
What does that mean?
What does before time mean?
That's impossible. No life could have existed back then.
It's a belief.
Rose, don't listen.
Stop.
Everyone just stop.
You want voices in the dark
Then listen to mine. That thing is playing on very basic fears. Darkness, childhood nightmares, all that stuff.
Or a good psychologist.
Okay, but what makes his version of the truth any better than mine, hmm? Cos I'll tell you what I can see. Humans.
Brilliant humans. Humans who travel all the way across space, flying in a tiny little rocket
Right into the orbit of a
Black hole, just for the sake of discovery. That's amazing!
Do you hear me?
Amazing, all of you. The Captain, his Officer, his elders, his juniors, his friends. All with one advantage. The Beast is alone. We are not. If we can use that to fight against him
Get out!
How much air have we got?
And then what?
Abseil. Right.
I'll get back. Rose is up there.
Well, it's half of a good plan.
I go down, not you.
Fine. Should work. Doesn't feel like such a good idea now.
Hmm, there it is again. That itch. Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down.
No, that's not it. That's too kind. It's not the urge to jump. It's deeper than that. It's the urge to fall!
Not bad, thanks. The wall of the pit seems to be the same as the cavern, just not much of it. There's a crust about twenty feet down and then nothing. Just the pit. Okay, then. Lower me down.
You get representations of the Horned Beast right across the universe, in the myths and legends of a million worlds. Earth, Draconia, Velconsadine, Daemos. The Kaled god of war. It's the same image, over and over again. Maybe that idea came from somewhere, bleeding through. The thought at the back of every sentient mind.
Could be.
Well, if that's what you want to believe. Maybe that's what the devil is, in the end. An idea.
Nothing. Could be miles to go, yet. Or could be thirty feet. No way of telling. I could survive thirty feet.
You bring me back, then we're just going to sit there and run out of air. I've got to go down.
Call it an act of faith.
I know.
I didn't ask. Have you got any sort of faith?
Neo Classics, have they got a devil?
Same thing in the end.
I believe, I believe I haven't seen everything, I don't know. It's funny, isn't it? The things you make up. The rules. If that thing had said it came from beyond the universe, I'd believe it, but before the universe? Impossible. Doesn't fit my rule. Still, that's why I keep travelling. To be proved wrong. Thank you, Ida.
If they get back in touch, if you talk to Rose, just tell her. Tell her. Oh, she knows.
I'm breathing. Air cushion to support the fall. You can breath down here, Ida. Can you hear me, Ida?
A rocket.
The history of some big battle. Man against Beast. I don't know if you're getting this, Ida. Hope so. Anyway, they defeated the Beast and imprisoned it.
Or maybe that's the key.
Or the gate, or the bars.
I accept that you exist. I don't have to accept what you are, but you're physical existence, I'll give you that. I don't understand. I was expected down here. I was given a safe landing and air. You need me for something. What for? Have I got to, I don't know, beg an audience? Or is there a ritual? Some sort of incantation or summons or spell? All these things I don't believe in, are they real? Speak to me! Tell me! You won't talk. Or you can't talk. Oh, hold on, wait a minute, just let me. Oh! No. Yes! No. Think it through. You spoke before. I heard your voice. An intelligent voice. No, more than that. Brilliant. But, looking at you now, all I can see is Beast. The animal. Just the body. You're just the body, the physical form. What's happened to your mind, hmm? Where's it gone? Where's that intelligence? Oh, no.
You're imprisoned, long time ago. Before the universe, after, sideways, in between, doesn't matter. The prison is perfect. It's absolute, it's eternal. Oh, yes! Open the prison, the gravity field collapses. This planet falls into the black hole! You escape, you die. Brilliant! But that's just the body. The body is trapped, that's all. The devil is an idea. In all those civilisations, just an idea. But an idea is hard to kill. An idea could escape. The mind. The mind of the great Beast. The mind can escape! Oh, but that's it! You didn't give me air, your jailers did. They set this up all those years ago! They need me alive, because if you're escaping, then I've got to stop you. If I destroy your prison, your body is destroyed. Your mind with it.
But then you're clever enough to use this whole system against me. If I destroy this planet, I destroy the gravity field. The rocket. The rocket loses protection and falls into the black hole. I have to sacrifice Rose.
So, that's the trap. Or the test, or the final judgment, I don't know. But if I kill you, I kill her. Except that implies in this big grand scheme of Gods and Devils that she's just a victim. But I've seen a lot of this universe. I've seen fake gods and bad gods and demi-gods and would-be gods, and out of all that, out of that whole pantheon, if I believe in one thing, just one thing, I believe in her.
This is your freedom. Free to die. You're going into that black hole and I'm riding with you.
Sorry about the hijack, Captain. This is the good ship Tardis.
Now, first thing's first. Have you got a
Rose Tyler on board?
I'm just towing you home. Gravity schmavity. My people practically invented black holes.
Well, in fact, they did. In a couple of minutes, we'll be nice and safe. Oh, and Captain?
Can we do a swap? Say, if you give me
Rose Tyler, I'll give you Ida Scott? How about that?
Yeah! Bit of oxygen starvation, but she should be all right. I couldn't save the Ood. I only had time for one trip.
They went down with the planet.
Ah! Entering clear space. End of the line. Mission
Closed.
Zach? We'll be off, now. Have a good trip home.
And the next time you get curious about something. Oh, what's the point. You'll just go blundering in. The human race.
I don't know. Never did decipher that writing. But that's good, Day I know everything? Might as well stop.
I think we beat it. That's good enough for me.
Then it lied. Right, onwards, upwards. Ida? See you again, maybe.
Oh, the stuff of legend.

Oh, I'm not sure, my child. You'll notice they're wearing Grecian costumes.
I haven't the remotest idea, my boy. No doubt their reasons will be entirely adequate. Yes, I think I perhaps I'd better go and ask them where we are.
Oh, what nonsense. If you take notice of them, I think they're doing more talking than they are fighting. I think I'd better go and ask them where we are.
Now you stay here, my dear, and look after that ankle.
Not at all, young man. You stay here and keep an eye on Vicki. Besides, I don't think your present humour is fitting for the occasion. You know, I don't think they'd appreciate your kind of sarcasm.
Stop! You must not kick a man when he is down. You have killed this poor fellow!
In my name, indeed! Get up! Get up, I tell you! This is terrible.
What is this? What is it you take me for?
What! Do you really? And who might you be, may I ask?
Well, if I may say so, you're not very humble, are you? Yes, I think I know you. Yes. And this friend of yours must be
Blasphemy? I'm sure he didn't mean it.
Oh, did he now? Well, if you notice, I have no beard.
Oh, do I?
I beg your pardon. I do nothing of the kind!
Oh, indeed. Indeed so. Yes, so I should hope. Yes, well, thank you. I'm glad to meet you. Now, if you will excuse me, I must get back to my temple. Attend to his funeral.
Do you realise whom you are addressing?
Then do not hinder me, or I will strike you with a thunderbolt!
Well, I don't see why I should. I have many other commitments, you must understand.
Certainly not.
I wouldn't stand for that if I were you!
Oh yes, it's true.
Oh yes, I find it most interesting.
This is my travelling temple. Being small, it's convenient.
Certainly not! In any case, I must be off.
No. I, er
I am quite capable of walking.
I refuse to enter into any kind of vulgar bawdry.
Have a care! Do not touch me!
You may rise. I am most displeased. Who is in command here?
As I have always understood. Yet this mountebank Odysseus appears to be a law unto himself. He makes fun of his guests, and laughs at Zeus.
If I am not a god, how do you account for my supernatural knowledge?
I could tell you one or two things that might surprise you.
Your wife, for instance, is unfaithful to you.
Then treat me with honour and return me to my temple, before I really become angry.
If I were an enemy, what could one man do alone and unarmed against the glory that is Greece, hmm?
No, no, Achilles, leave him. Why try to kill him now when you are in sight of victory.
I could almost guarantee it.
But first I would like to know am I to be treated as a god, or as an enemy? If you kill me now, it will probably cost you the war.
Arrest? But I must return to my TAR, er, my temple.
Very well.
Only for what he seems to be.
Quite so.
I do not know, and I do not care.
I think it would be much safer on the whole. Stop! Have you lost your senses?
Do not mock me, my Lord Odysseus. Would you stain the tent of Agamemnon's with a Trojan's blood? I claim this man as a sacrifice to Olympus! Bring him to my temple in the plain, at sunrise in the morning, and I will show you a miracle.
I will strike him with a bolt from heaven!
Yes, I did.
Disappeared?
Well, it should be about here somewhere. Rather hard to understand, these sandy plains are so much alike.
This sacrifice can only be performed within the temple.
Do not labour this point. I am not Zeus, and this young man is a friend of mine. Neither of us are Trojans, sir.
Of course she couldn't. I told you last night.
I think you had better tell him.
Well, I would hardly call it a miscalculation, my boy.
Well, I think with all eternity to choose from, I did rather well to get us back to Earth.
No, they didn't.
Yes. Yes, I dare say. I suppose some kind of ritual death, I presume?
And what are those conditions, may I ask?
Two days! That isn't very long, is it.
Oh, my dear boy, I couldn't possibly suggest that. The whole story is obviously absurd. Probably invented by Homer as some good dramatic device. No, I think it would be completely impractical.
Oh, patience, my
Yes. Well, I have thought up of some conditions of my own.
Well, it's all very simple. That is, if you want me to help you sack the city, you must promise me that Vicki will be spared.
Well, we're not quite sure of that, are we?
My dear boy, are you quite sure?
I sincerely hope not. Have you thought of tunnelling?
Ah, yes. Dear me, sear me. Well, tell me, have you thought about flying machines?
Considerable. Here. Now, you just take that for a moment. Now, pay attention please.
Well, what does it look like? A flying machine.
Excellent! Since you're so familiar with this project, then it's so much easier for me to talk to you. Come along. Come along.
Now, of course you realise that we can build a much larger one, capable of carrying a man.
Oh, think, my dear Odysseus. A whole fleet of them carrying a company of soldiers over the walls and into Troy.
Catapults!
Nonsense! The catapult is, well, you could make one for yourself out of strips of ox hide, and secure both ends, and then stretch it out like a bow-string.
Then you pour water over it, let it dry in the sun, and what happens then?
Never mind that. It shrinks. Now, allow me to demonstrate. You place the flying machine thus, as you would an arrow in a bow, and let it go.
The machine flies in the air with a soldier clinging to its back.
Agamemnon, then.
Thank you. I thought you'd like it.
Oh? Why not?
Well, anyone could do it, for that matter. I mean, even a child could operate it.
Excellent, excellent!
I'm thinking.
Dismiss them then.
Oh, I'm quite well aware of that, but I'm afraid this machine isn't going to work.
No, no, no. It isn't that. Not at all. I've made a mistake in my calculations.
Yes, yes. I'm afraid we must face up to it, Odysseus, man was never meant to fly.
Oh? What do you mean?
Ah, but I have another idea. And a much better one.
Have you ever thought of a horse?
It should be a huge horse, about forty feet high.
We build it hollow, and we fill it with soldiers and leave it on the sandy plain for the Trojans to capture it.
And the Greeks pretend to sail away.
Well, it's all perfectly simple.
We build it of wood, and we build it hollow. Then we fill it with a picked team of soldiers.
You take to the ships and sail away, to make the Trojans think you've all gone.
You all come back again, of course.
None of this must happen before nightfall.
That wasn't part of the plan.
That will not be necessary. I shall only get in the way.
Then they drag the horse into the city.
Oh, well, that is a calculated risk. But somehow I don't believe they'll want to destroy one of their own gods.
Yes, I only wish I shared your confidence.
No, no, Odysseus. It isn't that. But, I just didn't like the look of those fetlocks. They've no safety margin at all.
Ah, suppose it collapses whilst we're all in it?
Yes, and I've no wish to be made a laughing stock.
Odysseus. Come here, quickly.
I've never felt less like sleep in my life. I thought I saw some movement down there.
I think I ought to warn you that I've given second thoughts to the whole of this scheme, and I think it better we turn round and go back before it's too late. Get out of my way.
Well, but I, I
Oh.
I'm still very worried about those fetlocks.
If only you would have allowed me another day to fit shock absorbers. Oh, I say! Oh!
Oh! Well now, what is it you propose to do?
How you can sit there so peacefully defeats me. Have you no feelings, no emotions?
You mean they'll desert us?
That is a most immoral way of looking at life.
Yes, well I must get out of here at once.
I've only got to pull that lever and I can get back down into the square.
I will not be party to your schemes. You forced me to invent this contraption.
You had no right to bring me here at all. I'm utterly useless to you. You must let me out of here. You're selfish, greedy, corrupt, cheap, horrible. Your one thought is for yourself and what you can get out of it.
I will not be quiet. You may stay here if you wish to have your insignificant win, your victory or whatever you call it, but you must let me out of here.
Oh, my dear child! Oh, how lovely to see you. Where have you been all this time? And where's Steven?
Oh, now one thing at a time, child. Where's the young man?
But who is this child. Now pull yourself together. We've got to go.
We must all go and find him. Come along.
Listen, my dear child, the boy, the boy.
Oh, yes, but just be patient will you.
You're sure it's just the shoulder? Right. Well, steady, steady. Hold tight. Hold on. Yes, careful. Just a minute. Careful, careful, Vicki. Oh, dear, dear. This business. There we are. Now, come on bring him in. Bring him in there. Gently and carefully. That's it. That's it. Put him on the couch.
Share of what?
Now you stand back. I've gone far enough with you, my Lord Odysseus. You go adventuring on your own. Be off with you.
That's not good. That's not good at all. We must get help.
What's that, my dear?
No, no, no, no, no. Keep calm, keep calm.
Yes, yes. She's all right. Yes, yes.
No, no, no. That's not Vicki. That's not Vicki. Now keep calm.
Be quiet!
She's all right. She's all right. She wanted to stay.
Keep still.
She's all right. I know she is. She's gone to find Troilus and she'll be quite all right. This is just what she wanted. Now calm down. Yes, quiet, quiet.
Oh, you'll have to look after that young man. I think he has calmed down.
No, I don't know what Vicki has advised you, but
What was to come my dear?
My dear child, you're not dead. That's nonsense.
Well, as you wish.
Yes, yes, yes, as you wish, my child. Now, I want you to keep an eye on that young man. Will you?
His name is Steven. And remember Katarina, you must call me Doctor.
I'm not a Doc. I am not a god. Oh, my dear Vicki, I hope you'll be all right. I shall miss you child. Oh, yes, now. Those drugs, those drugs. What am I going to do? I must stop somewhere. But, how? I've got to! Yes! I must! I must!

There we are. Well, what do you think?
Oh, it's the Tardis. It's my home. At least, it has been for a considerable number of years.
What, these?
Oh no, no, no, no. Don't laugh. It's true. Your father and Maxtible were working on the same problem, but I have perfected a rather special model, which enables me to travel through the universe of time.
Well, if we count in Earth terms, I suppose I must be about four hundred, yes, about four hundred and fifty years old. Yes, well, quite. Now, I think Victoria might find that dress a little impracticable if she's going to join us in our adventures. Jamie, show her where she can find some new ones, will you?
A smooth take off? A smooth take off! What a nerve!
If you put it like that, I certainly will.
Thank you.
Now what's been happening over here?
Ah, and you think we did it? Oh, no. I can assure you that we had nothing to do with the death of this man. He appears to have been electrocuted. Trying to open these doors perhaps?
Expedition?
Really? Does it show?
No. Not until they tell me what the purpose of their expedition.
The problem, I take it, is to open these doors, right?
I'm afraid that that became impossible the moment that name was mentioned.
Cybermen.
We must stay.
We shall stay and help you with your search.
That's just it, you so obviously do. Now I'm sure we can agree. I can open those doors for you.
Ah, good, that's all settled. And now we shall open these doors.
It's perfectly safe now.
I'm afraid it's beyond my strength.
Jamie.
Quite. I think here is a gentleman who can open these doors for us.
Oh, there's no danger now. Unless of course he's afraid.
Oh, no, no, he's not afraid.
No, wait, wait. I would be very careful in there if I were you.
The poor fellow who died drained all there electricity out of his body. It's perfectly safe to go in there now.
But I'd still. I'd still be very careful if I were you. Very careful indeed! Come on, let's go and join them. Come on, Victoria.
You look very nice in that dress, Victoria.
A bit short? Oh, I shouldn't worry about that. Look at Jamie's.
Come along. Come along. Let's go and see what the others are doing, shall we? Come along.
Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly.
And the other two, of course.
Oh, yes. One in that section, and one in that section over there. Activated, I imagine, by this simple logical system over here. Here we are, I think.
Yes, splendid, splendid. A simple logical gate.
Oh no, not really. It's all based upon symbolic logic, the same as you use in computers. The opening mechanism for this door, an OR gate. you call it.
Oh, I use my own special technique.
Keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut.
No, not really. I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg a chance to show off his archaeological skills? I love to see the experts at work, don't you?
Yes, but why do it at all?
Some things are better left undone, and I have a feeling that this is one of them.
Well, it's all too easy, isn't it?
Insoluble?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Yes, well, what you've done here is mostly right.
You see, if you take any progressive series it can be converted into binary notation. If you take the sum of the integrants, and express the result as a power series, then the indices show the basic binary blocks. Only I wouldn't do it if I were you. Oh no, I really wouldn't do it!
You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone!
I don't know. Perhaps the Cybermen aren't quite as dormant as you imagine. We must find out what has happened to the others.
I wouldn't touch the projector controls if I were you. Someone might get hurt.
Yes, there is. Now let me see.)
Yes I think this is the sequence. Stand by to let her out, will you. And if you, my dear, would stand well clear. Thank you. Right!
Victoria, are you all right? It's all right. Get your breath. It's all right.
It's all right now.
No, I don't expect you did. You'll have to be a little more careful in future, won't you. Now, come along. We must go and see whether Jamie is all right. Come along.
Oh Jamie, don't touch that control!
Well, which one was it?
What exactly happened here, Jamie? What did you do? What sequence did you use?
They?
The question is, what killed him.
I saw something.
Poor Haydon was looking at that screen, in the direction we all were, right?
It's not so obvious when you consider he was shot in the back.
See for yourself. Now if the Cybermen didn't shoot him, what did? The answer, I think, lies over here. Jamie?
Can you remember exactly what you did, what sequence you used?
You must try. I want to repeat it all when I give the word.
Maybe. I don't know. Now, Jamie, when you're ready.
Now there is a distinct element of risk in what I'm asking you all to do, so if anyone wishes to leave they must do so at once. Not you, Jamie.
Not if you go back against that wall, in that corner there. Now, please. Right, Jamie.
It's all right. I think. I think it's all right now. Yes. You see, it's just a mock up, a model. No, don't touch that. That gun may be wired up too.
No I don't think so. I think it's a testing room for weapons. This is a purely robotic Cyberman. There's no human material in it at all. He's a target for weapons.
Victoria, be careful. Let me see that.
Yes, it's certainly inactive, but it's not a fossil. Wait a minute.
Yes, here we are. Yes, it's a Cybermat.
It's one of those. I'd leave it alone if I were you. Come along.
Or something.
I don't think we've got much choice.
Captain, you do have another reason for not wanting them back on the ship, don't you?
Or what?
I see.
All right.
Well, but can't we stay here? It seems a pleasant enough room to me.
Oh yes, I was forgetting. I can, can't I.
No. Not just yet awhile, no. But you and Jamie can go back to the Tardis if you wish.
Jamie?
Good.
Now, I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg some help.
It's all right, Jamie. Your colleague has very strong hands.
Enough to do a good deal of damage if let loose in the right place.
Logical, yes, but
Really.
I think perhaps your logic is wearing a little thin.
Congratulations.
Victoria, you would be much safer up here.
And much more use to us.
Keep an eye on (points at Kaftan) things. Please?
Thank you.
Mister Toberman?
Then I stay here too.
Remember what I said. Be very careful.
Well, which way do we go?
Yes.
In there, Jamie. Frozen forever. All their evil locked away with them. And so it must remain.
A signal that they're never going to get.
Well?
Perhaps it wasn't them. Where's Jamie?
Mister Klieg doesn't seem to be very worried.
Conveniently labelled in symbolic logic, I notice.
If it is the opening device.
Jamie, come back.
What do you think you're doing?
Jamie!
So did I, Jamie.
I wanted to know what he was up to.
You think the Cybermen will help you?
I think it's their leader, their Controller, Jamie.
Ah, I see, a trap. A very special sort of trap, too.
Well, don't you see? They only wanted superior intellects. That's why they made the trap so complicated.
Yes, and we've done exactly as you've calculated, haven't we?
No, no. We wouldn't even reach the ladder. It's too risky.
We'll play for time. Wait our chance. Leave it to me. Excuse me. May I ask a question? Why did you submit yourself to freezing? You don't have to answer that if you don't want to.
Oh? How?
Oh, thank you very much. Ah, yes. The lunar surface.
So that's why you attacked the Moonbase.
Oh, no, no. Keep away! Keep away! Keep away from me!
If only you'd let go I'd stand still.
If you would let go of me, I can stand still! You're breaking my arm!
No, Jamie. They're coming back.
Is he all right?
That way.
No, I'm not sure, but try it. I'll be with you in a minute.
Captain, we've got to stop them.
No, we can't do that. The hatch. We must get there first. Come on.
Oh! Ah! He's got my leg!
It's no use!
No. No, it's too soft. It must be Toberman and Klieg.
Yes, they're more dangerous down there than they are up here.
Excuse me, please.
Do you still think you can form an alliance with the Cybermen, Mister Klieg?
Well, what about the testing room? There's only one door. They can't get out.
We shall see.
I'm on your side, remember? Hey, why didn't you wake me? I should have been on watch half an hour ago.
Why me?
Oh, I think I know. Is it because I'm
Well that's very considerate of you, Victoria, but between you and me, I'm really quite lively actually, all things being considered.
Are you happy with us, Victoria?
Yes, I know, I know.
You miss him very much, don't you?
No, of course you won't. But, you know, the memory of him won't always be a sad one.
Eh?
Oh.
Oh yes, I can when I want to. And that's the point, really. I have to really want to, to bring them back in front of my eyes. The rest of the time they sleep in my mind, and I forget. And so will you. Oh yes, you will. You'll find there's so much else to think about. So remember, our lives are different to anybody else's. That's the exciting thing. There's nobody in the universe can do what we're doing. You must get some sleep and let this poor old man stay awake.
Jamie, Victoria, Callum, wake up. Wake up!
Callum. Callum!
Don't move, Callum. Don't move.
Now get back to the controls, all of you. Steady, don't make any sudden movements. Parry, Parry. Wake up, Parry. Wake up. Wake up. Don't panic. Come back with us. Steady. Now we'll all go in the other room and lock them out.
Back against the controls, everybody.
Here. Five me a hand, quick.
Lay this down on the ground. Come on!
Come on!
You're wasting your time. There are too many of them. Now, do what I say. Come back!
There you are, you see.
Well, they're a form of metallic life. They home on human brainwaves and attack.
Yes, quite safe now. The power cable generated an electrical field and confused their tiny metal minds. You might almost say that they've had a complete metal breakdown.
I'm so sorry, Jamie.
Come on. Now mind your feet.
You still think you can bargain with the Cybermen?
Use maybe, but you'll never control the Cybermen.
Yes, Jamie, yes.
Plan?
No!
Quiet, Jamie.
You seem to be in trouble.
Yes, yes, certainly. Jamie, Professor.
I think it best. Come on. Come along.
That's it. Up and in.
Yes. One moment.
In a moment, Jamie. Now, are you ready?
Now then, where would you rather have him, in or out of there?
Only we must make sure that he stays in there.
I think not. I think there must be some sort of internal timing mechanism. Jamie, I hope you made those ropes secure.
Good!
Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots sometime.
Look what they've done. You're not like them. You're a man like us. You must help us! He has killed Kaftan! You must help us.
Jamie, the hatch!
The gun, Jamie!
Are there any more?
No, wait a minute. I'd better go down there.
It's the only way to make sure.
No, wait. You stay and look after Victoria. I'll take somebody else.
Toberman, you see what these creatures have done to you? They've tried to make you like them. Do you understand? They've tried to make you their slave. They just want to use you. They are evil. Think of Kaftan.
They must be destroyed, do you see? Evil must be destroyed, Now, come!
Come! Come on! Come on!
Thank you.
I shan't need that.
Move quietly. They're all dormant, see.
No! Quietly. They're only asleep. They're not frozen yet. Now, you watch them. I have things to do. Now, let me see.
Yes.
Klieg!
No! No! You'll wake them up!
Yes, as you say, such a combination between intelligence and power would make you formidable indeed. Why you'd be commander of the universe with your brilliance! It makes the imagination reel with the possibilities!
Perhaps it's not too late?
No, Jamie, don't you see?
Don't you see what this is going to all mean to all the people who come to serve Klieg the All Powerful? Why, no country, no person would dare to have a single thought that was not your own. Eric Klieg's own conception of the, of the way of life!
Well now I know you're mad. I just wanted to make sure.
You know, I've heard all this before somewhere.
All right. Go ahead, kill us.
Quick Jamie. These two levers together.
What? You've got to trip that first.
Last time they were frozen for five centuries. This time it must be forever.
Here we are, Victoria, safe and sound. Close the hatch.
There we are. Now then. Now, the best thing about a machine that makes sense, you can very easily make it turn out nonsense.
There we are. Now I think you'd better all go outside.
I'm going to re-electrify the main doors.
Only this time I'm going to include the hatch and the control panel.
Anyone touching any of them will get a considerable shock. In fact, a fatal one.
Now, everyone outside. And please take him with you, I shall be glad to see him outside.
There we are. That's done. Now, we just have to close the main doors and the circuit is complete.
Jamie, you go that way, I'll go this way. That way will give us more of a chance. When I say run, run.
Run!
Quickly. Wait! Stop!
We'll get a shock. We must find something to insulate. I know, that shoring timber over there! Hurry up! Hurry up, he's coming!
Quickly! We must keep him inside or else all our work'll be wasted.
You must do!
Toberman, come away!
Goodbye.
I know. I know. Goodbye.
Yes, Jamie. On the other hand, I never like to make predictions. Come along.

Listen.
What are you doing down there?
Allow me. Yes, a ten pounder. That does it.
Why not?
It's unlikely.
It's been spiked.
It's been spiked.
I would like a hat like this. How do I look?
Bah. Romantic piffle.
Prince Charles Edward. Bonnie Prince Charlie.
Die?
Just think of the women.
Well done, Ben. And now, gentlemen.
Your swords, I think. Ben, cock the pistol.
Polly, take the swords. That's the style. Now, back against the wall, both of you. Go on! That's better. Now, I'm going to have a look at the wound. Come along, come along, let me see. Yes. We're going to need some clean water to bathe the wound. Ah.
We're not going to harm him. Polly?
You go with her.
Off you go then.
You can put that away now, Ben.
Will you both give us your word that you'll not molest us? We're only trying to save your Laird from bleeding to death.
Put it away, Ben.
A Highlanders word is his bond. At least don't point it at me!
What's? You should have paid more attention to your history books, Ben.
Wait! Wait!
(German accent) I'm glad you've come, Sergeant. I was waiting for an escort.
Civil tongue, Sergeant! You are in charge of these men?
A gentleman at last. Doctor von Wer, at your service.
(sotto) That's what I said.
German, from Hanover. Where your good King George comes from. And I speak English a good deal better than he does.
Didn't I tell you I was
What a great devotion to duty your Lieutenant shows, Sergeant.
You think he will catch them?
Disrespect to your superior officer, Sergeant? I could report you.
Ah, but at a price, Sergeant.
Ah, yes.
Article Seventeen, Aliens Act, 1730.
You are gentlemen of the law?
Then you are doubtless familiar with Article Seventeen. You cannot hang a citizen of a foreign power, without first informing his ambassador.
German. And I know more about the English law than you do, it seems.
With proper care, yes.
What will happen to us?
I'm glad we did. I'm just beginning to enjoy myself. Down with King George!
No, not really. I just like hearing the echo, that's all. Let's have a look at his wound, shall we?
With care that'll heal.
Blood letting.
Oh, Isis and Osiris, is it meet? Aquarius, Aries, Taurus.
Gemini and Taurus. When was the Laird born?
That's what I thought. Now, blood letting must wait until Taurus is in the ascendant. So it is willed.
Of course I do. So does he. He's never heard of germs.
It's a secret word.
Used by German doctors.
Yes. Have you got a handkerchief, Ben?
Good.
Thank you. Just a fresh dressing.
Hello, what's this?
No, wait.
What chance do you think he has of evading the gallows with this on him?
Besides, it's really rather nice and warm. Let's have a tune to cheer us all up.
Well, you're a loyal Jacobite, aren't you? This is your tune. Come on, everybody, join in.
(German) Thank heavens. Did you hear that tune?
They were singing it to drive me out of my mind, as I'm a loyal subject to King George the Second!
They know of a plot to murder your general, the Duke of Cumberland.
Take me to Solicitor Grey. Perhaps we're in time to prevent it.
Well, it's only just discovered. That rogue is party to it!
Auf Wiedersehen.
There is no plot.
Would the chance to lay your hands on 15,000 pounds be a waste of your time?
The personal standard of Prince Charles Edward.
Whoever was entrusted with this standard stood closest to the councils of the Prince, you would agree? He would also know where the Prince was most likely to run to.
That must remain my secret for the time being.
But why employ them, since we are both on the same side? The 30,000 pounds reward for the capture of the Prince is surely enough to satisfy both of us.
I am on the track of some, but I need a free hand.
Don't cry out. I'm not very expert with these things and it just might go off in your face. Turn around and put your hands behind you.
Just keep very still.
There, now turn around. Why, great heavens, man, your throat.
It's so swollen. Does it hurt you?
Say ahh.
Ahh.
I've never seen a silent lawyer before.
Would you mind just waiting in here? Another patient, you understand.
Enter.
You thought what?
Your master's a very sick man. He's gone to lie down. It lucky for him I was called in time. Well, great heavens, man. Your eyes!
Your eyes. Come over here to the light.
No headaches?
Oh dear. You call me a liar?
Of course it does, what did you expect? Your eyes.
Print blindness. You read too much.
You must rest them for at least an hour.
That is my prescription. Ignore it at your peril. Now, lie down on the table. That's right. And put this over your eyes and rest them for at least an hour.
Knocking? It's not knocking, it's in your mind. In your eyes. Now rest your eyes and the knocking will grow fainter, and fainter, and fainter. One hour, remember.
But, officer
I've bought a wee drop of broth for Mister Trask.
Will you have it officer? It's a pity to waste a nice hot broth. Do you good.
(woman) You need four for whist.
There's nothing nicer than a nice game of whist.
(normal) I'm sure you'll oblige an old woman.
Perhaps you'd like to count the trumps?
Oh dear, clubs. Would you like to deal, Polly orange wench.
Not just yet. Remember, you have seen nothing.
Your eyes.
Yes. You wouldn't want another headache, now would you?
I tell you what we're going to do. We ladies are going to leave first, but you are going to sit here, quietly, comfortably, for another ten minutes.
Before you leave, because I am going to watch you all the time. And if you move
Now, girls, let's leave this rough place. Ten minutes, remember?
Very good, very good.
It's not loaded. They're dangerous things.
Oh, you saucy girl.
I know.
Do? What do you mean, do?
All right, go ahead.
They're on the ship.
They're on the ship, the Annabelle. Master's name, Trask. Not a nice man. You wouldn't like him.
Or what?
It'd be safer.
Well it wouldn't be for very long. Just for seven, just for a few years, and then it'd be safe to come back.
Oh, please yourself. But you and your father may get killed if you stay in the glens.
Hmm?
Hmm!
No.
Well, it's just a wee idea really.
I've only just thought about it. It won't work, but it'd be a try. Anyone got any money?
That's a fortune in these days. Now, we want weapons, lots of them, and a rowing boat.
Good, and we can buy the weapons.
From the English soldiers. Well, they're bound to have heaps of weapons as souvenirs.
You don't know the English soldier. He'd sell his grandmother for tuppence ha'penny.
We smuggle them aboard the Annabelle.
Oh, I don't know, we'll think of something. I must get some sleep.
Me.
No. Let's see yours first.
Oh. It's a start.
Yes, something like that.
I know.
Just a minute.
This ring. Now, let me see.
I'm not surprised. It's not her father's.
Then why has it the Stuarts' seal?
Until the right time. That time has now arrived.
Then it is right and proper that it should now save his life. Give it me. Thank you. I wonder. Bait.
Bait for a very greedy man.
Who else would be walking around the jetty at this time of night dressed like a soldier who'd been wounded in battle?
Why? Because I like it here. Besides, it keeps the other soldiers away.
I know just the place. Hold that. I'll just get these things aboard the boat.
Just a few wee gifties for our friends aboard the Annabelle. Come on.
Yes. Can you imagine, I found them thrown out on the rubbish dump, behind the inn.
Now then, do we all know what we have to do? Ben?
But it may be dangerous. They may not swallow my story.
I would like a hat like that.
Very well, you shall come in the rowing boat. It might be a good idea at that.
I've got another idea for you, Ben.
Want to see him.
(German) And of my own free will. I'm delighted to meet you again, Mister Solicitor Grey.
If you'd ask these fellows to let go of my arms, I have a small token for you.
Now then, let me see, where did I put it. No, it's not in there. I transferred it from there, into this pocket. Well it's not there now, perhaps it's in here.
Got it!
Here we are. Look at the seal.
Well, Mister Grey?
From the hands of Prince Charles himself.
In prison.
It's perfectly easy. Prince Charles disguised himself as a Highlander and was taken prisoner with the rest of the rebels.
I wonder what that information would be worth? Now let me see.
Well, shall we say, ten thousand guineas?
The very last place you would think of looking for him.
Right here on this ship.
Did you mark the young Highlander who was with me? The piper?
With the soft hands and face?
Did you notice his hair? Unmistakable, that was the Prince.
Would I come and place myself in your hands if I was not very sure?
Aren't you forgetting one thing?
I'm the only one who knows what he looks like.
No.
No. Perhaps he is further over.
I've found him. He's the little one, over there.
Ben, well done, well done, well done. Kirsty, here's your father. There we are. Polly
Got lost in the fog.
Only for the moment.
Right.
We have to go ashore now.
We'll take Mister Grey ashore as a hostage.
Well I
Many of your people speak French?
Then take him with you. He'll stay loyal enough.
Till the wind shifts again. Laird, we must go.
Bring the prisoner over!
The fog will help them. More than it will help us.
Glad to have you with us, Jamie.
They heard.
Shh.
Grey!
No. No, Ben. It's too late.
We'll find someone else, eh, Polly?
If you don't mind.
(German) Doctor von Wer at your service. Remedies for the ague, the twitch, the colic, the warts and the gout.
Oh, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't waste your time with that, a fine healthy gentleman like yourself. No, it's this ring you see, sir.
Well, you go up there and to the left. No perhaps it's better to explain this way. To the right
No. On second thought, perhaps the other way. We were taking the Lieutenant, you see, sir.
Oh, no, no, sir.
That might frighten the blackguard, sir. We are enough to apprehend him.
We will bring him back to you, sir. Right?
Well, it's time we said goodbye, Lieutenant. And thank you.
What wicked times we live in, Lieutenant. A prison commissioner using his office to smuggle rebels out of the country.
Contracts? I don't believe I saw any contracts. Did you, Ben?
Or you Jamie?
So sad. Once a promising legal talent.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I've no idea.
Well how did they get there?
True. His ship's sailed.
If he teaches me to play the bagpipes.

Shoes. Must find my shoes.
Unhand me, madam.
Lethbridge-Stewart? My dear fellow, how nice to see you again.
Don't you recognise me?
Oh, dear. Oh, I can't have changed that much, surely? Oh, I must see what they've done to me. Can I borrow, can I borrow a mirror, please?
Thank you. Oh, no! Oh, no. Well, that's not me at all. No wonder you didn't recognise me. Oh, that face. That hair. Oh, I don't know, though. I think it's rather distinctive, actually. Don't you think? No, you don't. Oh, anyway, I'm tired. All this exercise and exertion. It's been too much. Have to get some sleep now.
My shoes? Where are my shoes? I must find my shoes.
I must find my shoes.
You don't understand, madam. It's most important.
Shoes.
Shoes.
All right, all right, I suppose you want to see my pass? Yes, well, I haven't got one. And I'm not going to tell you my name, either. Now you just tell Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart that I want to see him. Well, don't just stand there arguing with me, man! Get on with it!
Ah, there you are, my dear fellow. I expect you're wondering how I found you here?
Fortunately I had this with me, you see. It homes on the Tardis. Oh, there she is. How nice of you to look after her for me. Do you happen to have got the key, by the way?
Ah ha! But it will for me.
My dear Brigadier, it's no earthly good asking me a lot of questions. I've lost my memory, you see?
Ah, but you don't, you don't. Only I know that. What do you think of my new face, by the way? I wasn't too sure about it myself to begin with. But it sort of grows on you. Very flexible, you know. Could be useful on the planet Delphon, where they communicate with their eyebrows. Well, that's strange. How on Earth did I remember that?
That's Delphon for how do you do. Delighted, Miss Shaw, delighted.
Practically everything, my dear.
Did I really? How terribly exciting.
I've no recollection of last night. That's most unfair. How could I possible what on earth are these?
Plastic?
That's interesting. I wonder what was inside.
Yes, well, you can tell from the shape this was a hollow sphere. I should think the space inside was about three thousand cubic centimetres, wouldn't you?
If I do, will you give me the key to the Tardis?
Then go away and let Miss Shaw and I get on with our work, there's a good fellow. Look, do I really have to call you Miss Shaw?
Liz. That's much better. How many of these things actually came down?
And you found only fragments, no whole ones?
Then the answer to your question's obvious, isn't it? By the time your search party arrived, the rest of these things had been collected. Collected and taken somewhere. The question is, where?
No.
Well, don't worry, m'dear. We've done our best.
Yes, what results can you expect with this primitive equipment?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know all that. But what we really need is a lateral molecular rectifier.
Not on Earth, unfortunately. But I think I have one in the Tardis.
Yes. I'm sure I have one somewhere. But I'm sure I used one some time in the past, or was it the future?
My dear Liz, I have an entire laboratory.
No, no, no, it's true. Well, you think that the Tardis isn't big enough, don't you? That's because you keep looking at it simply as a police box.
Oh no, not once you get inside it, it isn't. You see, Liz, the Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.
Yes, it would take far too long to try and explain that to you. The important thing is that we've got to get this material analysed.
Child's play. The only trouble is Lethbridge-Stewart has taken away the key and I can't get inside.
Yes. Of course, there is always the possibility that you might be able to persuade him to part with it.
I'm afraid he's going to be awfully cross with you.
Well, that's because the lock has a metabolism detector.
Just testing. I wanted to see if the controls
Yes. The temptation was too strong, my dear. It's just that I couldn't bear the thought of being tied to one planet and one time. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
Must I? The Tardis no longer works, as you saw.
I couldn't escape now if I wanted to. They've trapped me here!
That mean, despicable, underhanded lot! They've changed the dematerialisation code.
The dematerial. It doesn't matter, you wouldn't understand anyway.
Yes, well, I've tried to help you the best way I can, but I need more evidence. I need more to go on.
You know, Brigadier, I think perhaps a visit to that plastics factory would be in order, don't you?
Brigadier, I think we'll come with you, if you don't mind.
You know, this really is most interesting. We must examine it in the laboratory.
Well, I was right about the shape, wasn't I? The signal must have been muffled by the metal of that trunk. It's most interesting.
There's no reason why it should as long as we treat it gently. Unless, of course
It has a built-in destruct impulse. In that case, we'll just have to risk it.
Yes, and until we know a bit more about these things, I think we should move very cautiously.
No, he didn't cut his way out, but somebody cut their way in. This canvas has been ripped from the outside.
If Mister Ransome is anywhere, he'll be at that plastics factory. So I suggest that we go there immediately.
What exactly are you making here?
And can these mannequins actually move?
Yes, well, I've think we've seen all we can possibly see here. I'm sorry if we've been a nuisance.
Here, come over here, you two. Look at this.
Yes.
It measures mental activity. It's fascinating, isn't it?
Yes. You know, it's as I suspected. This globe is only a container. I wonder whether we can communicate with it?
Well, it appears that in there we have what one might loosely call a brain. Fifty megacycles, Liz. If we can establish the frequency on which it operates
Oh, dear.
Yeah, or part of a brain. An intelligence. Yes, that's probably nearer the mark.
Well, the rest of itself, surely?
Mmm hmm.
My dear fellow, it's not sentient.
No, once here it can presumably create a suitable shell for itself. Otherwise there'd be no point in coming.
Yes.
That's going to take time.
Facsimile? Of General Scobie?
Oh my goodness. The waxworks.
Well, I think this is the right room. Liz?
Do you recognise any of these people?
Yes. Oh, excuse me?
I understand these figures aren't made of wax. Is that right?
Are they supplying any more or is the tableau complete now?
Well that was quick. When did he visit the factory?
Shush. Liz, if you were making a model of someone, would you put a wristwatch on it.
Yes. Would you go to the trouble of winding it up and keeping it at the correct time? I think you and I had better have a word with Lethbridge-Stewart.
Well, when he comes in, tell him that I'll call again later, will you? Goodbye.
Well, there's only one thing we can do. Wait.
Closing time.
Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. They're only dummies. I think. It's funny how their eyes seem to follow you, isn't it?
Hmm?
No, it's only your imagination.
Yes, yes, I'm sure they are. LIZ: But when you talked about the watch, you meant that this is the real General Scobie.
Yes, and his plastic facsimile is walking around somewhere. Now just
Quick! Back behind the curtain.
Shush.
Shush, shush, shush! If you tell Channing that we're here, the Autons will kill us, as I think they killed your friend Ransome.
Channing is controlling your mind. You must resist him. Channing is your enemy. The enemy of the entire human race!
Now listen to me, Hibbert. You've got to get away from Channing. Get away and think. Now, come to UNIT. I can help you.
It's the facsimiles, Brigadier. They're moving. They've just left the waxworks.
By tomorrow, they will have taken over the key positions in the entire country. Now you've got to move against that factory now!
And a red. Here it is. Hold onto those for a moment, will you?
It's started, hasn't it?
Now look, you two, we haven't got much time.
Well, of course it's going to work.
Well, I'm trying to devise a weapon that we can use against them. Well, it's not very efficient, I know, but it's the best that I can do. And then you've got to take me to the security area of that factory.
Well, how many men can you raise?
Well then, that'll have to do, won't it?
Channing is controlling your mind. You must resist him. Channing is your enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.
Will you stand well back, please?
Perhaps I can settle this argument? I mean, as to whether this really is General Scobie.
General Scobie, would you be kind enough to say a few words into the microphone?
Switch on, Liz!
I don't think so. You see, he was never really alive.
If we're quick, my dear, we can save everybody a lot of trouble.
Now!
Well, there we are, my dear Liz. Who said we got the wrong frequency?
On this planet, there is a saying that it is never too late. Good gracious! What on earth is this thing?
Is that what you look like on your own planet?
So this thing is a sort of collective brain, nervous system?
Oh, but I'm not human. So, if you live as a group, you can be destroyed as a group, surely?
I destroyed your facsimile of Scobie, therefore I can destroy all of you.
So you see, Mister Channing, with this device I can eliminate you.
Oh no! Switch on, Liz! Liz, switch on!
It's not working!
Liz, come on. Liz, come on, quick! Well, what's wrong with it?
You can switch off, I think, now, Liz.
Only much more powerful, of course.
Possibly. They're telepathic, so they certainly know what happened.
Yes, well, before we go into all that, Brigadier, I think we must discuss terms.
Yes. After all, you do want to take advantage of my services again, don't you?
Money? My dear chap, I don't want money. I've got no use for the stuff.
Well, facilities to repair the Tardis, laboratory, equipment, help from Miss Shaw here.
My goodness, no. Don't you realise that when I was stranded on this little planet of yours, I had nothing but these clothes that I Oh, my goodness!
Well, I've just realised. I don't even own these. I borrowed them from the hospital. And there's that car, too. Yes, you know, I took to that car. It had character.
Must it? Yes, yes, I suppose it must. Still, there's no reason why you couldn't find me something similar, is there? I mean, it could persuade me to stay, you know.
Good. When can we go and choose it?
Smith. Doctor John Smith.

About twelve hours.
What're you going to tell her?
It's not twelve hours, it's twelve months. You've been gone a whole year. Sorry.
Actually, it's my fault. I sort of er, employed Rose as my companion.
No.
I am a Doctor.
Middling.
Well, if it's this much trouble, are you going to stay here now?
Well, she's not coming with us.
I don't do families.
Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been slapped by someone's mother.
It hurt!
That's my age.
Yeah.
It's blocked off.
I know. I can't believe I'm here to see this. This is fantastic!
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
I bet you are. This is what I travel for, Rose. To see history happening right in front of us.
Better not. They've already got one spaceship in the middle of London. I don't want to shove another one on top.
You'd be surprised. Emergency like this, there'll be all kinds of people watching. Trust me. The Tardis stays where it is.
Yes, we are.
Oi, I'm trying to listen.
Go on.
Nowhere. It's just a bit human in there for me. History just happened and they're talking about where you can buy dodgy top-up cards for half price. I'm off on a wander, that's all.
Nothing to do with me. It's not an invasion. That was a genuine crash landing. Angle of descent, colour of smoke, everything. It's perfect.
So maybe this is it. First contact. The day mankind officially comes into contact with an alien race. I'm not interfering because you've got to handle this on your own. That's when the human race finally grows up. Just this morning you were all tiny and small and made of clay. Now you can expand.
You don't need me. Go and celebrate history. Spend some time with your mum.
Tell you what. Tardis key. It's about time you had one. See you later.
Shush!
Defence plan delta! Come on. Move! Move!
Spread out. Tell the perimeter it's a lockdown.
Do it!
Coma, shock, hibernation, anything. What does it look like?
It's still here.
Hello.
Don't shoot!
What did you do that for? It was scared! It was scared.
More like a mermaid. Victorian showmen used to draw the crowds by taking the skull of a cat, gluing it to a fish and calling it a mermaid. Now someone's taken a pig, opened up it's brain, stuck bits on, then they've strapped it in that ship and made it dive bomb. It must've been terrified. They've taken this animal and turned it into a joke.
All right, so I lied. I went and had a look. But the whole crash landing's a fake. I thought so. Just too perfect. I mean, hitting Big Ben. Come on, so I thought let's go and have a look
Oh, that's just what I need. Don't you dare make this place domestic.
You see what I mean? Domestic.
Ricky.
No, it's Ricky.
You think you know your own name? How stupid are you?
Yep.
Good point! So, what're they up to?
Ricky.
Ricky. If I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent time ship, would you even begin to understand?
Well, shut it, then.
Got it! Ha, ha! Patched in the radar, looped it back twelve hours so we can follow the flight of that spaceship. Here we go. Hold on. Come on.
That's the spaceship on its way to Earth, see? Except. Hold on. See? The spaceship did a sling shot round the Earth before it landed.
It means it came from Earth in the first place. It went up and came back down. Whoever those aliens are, they haven't just arrived, they've been here for a while. The question is, what have they been doing?
All the basic packages.
Yes, I get the football. Hold on, I know that lot.
UNIT. United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. Good people.
That's nice. Good boy, Ricky.
They wouldn't recognise me. I've changed a lot since the old days. Besides, the world's on a knife-edge. There's aliens out there and fake aliens. We want to keep this alien out of the mix. I'm going undercover. And er, I'd better keep the Tardis out of sight. Ricky, you've got a car. You can do some driving.
The roads are clearing. Let's go and have a look at that spaceship.
Take me to your leader.
We're not being arrested, we're being escorted.
Where'd you think? Downing Street.
I'm not.
That's the one.
I hate to say it, but Mickey was right. Over the years I've visited this planet a lot of times, and I've been, er, noticed.
Like it said on the news. They're gathering experts in alien knowledge. And who's the biggest expert of the lot?
Apart from him.
I'm telling you. Lloyd George, he used to drink me under the table. Who's the Prime Minister now?
I don't go anywhere without her.
She's staying with me.
Sure.
I suppose so. Don't get in any trouble.
Of course, the really interesting bit happened three days ago, see, filed away under Any Other Business. The North Sea. A satellite detected a signal, a little blip of radiation, at one hundred fathoms, like there's something down there. You were just about to investigate and the next thing you know, this happens. Spaceships, pigs, massive diversion. From what?
If aliens fake an alien crash and an alien pilot, what do they get? Us. They get us. It's not a diversion, it's a trap.
This is all about us. Alien experts. The only people with knowledge how to fight them gathered together in one room.
Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world?

Just one trip. That's what I said. One trip in the Tardis, and then home. Although I suppose we could stretch the definition. Take one trip into past, one trip into future. How do you fancy that?
How about a different planet?
Ah, there's plenty of other places.
Well, it's beautiful, yeah.
I suppose it is.
Yeah.
The sky's a burnt orange, with the Citadel enclosed in a mighty glass dome, shining under the twin suns. Beyond that, the mountains go on forever. Slopes of deep red grass, capped with snow.
Nah. Where's the fun for me? I don't want to go home. Instead, this is much better. Year five billion and fifty-three, planet New Earth. Second hope of mankind. Fifty thousand light years from your old world, and we're slap bang in the middle of New New York. Although, technically it's the fifteenth New York from the original, so it's New New New New New New New New New New New New New New York. One of the most dazzling cities ever built.
Nah, bit of rain never hurt anyone. Come on, let's get under cover!
Hold on, hold on. Let's have a look.
Oh, that's more like it. That's the view we had last time. This must be the lower levels, down in the base of the tower. Some sort of under-city.
Much more interesting. It's all cocktails and glitter up there. This is the real city.
That's me. Ah, the rain's stopping. Better and better.
Er, yeah. Yeah, it was, yeah.
What's wrong with that?
No, thanks.
I think they're selling moods.
Sorry, but hold on a minute. What happened to your parents?
Yeah, but they might drive back.
But they can't have gone far. You could find them. No. No, no, don't.
Your parents. Your mother and father. They're on the motorway.
No, let her go! I'm warning you, let her go! Whatever you want, I can help. Both of us, we can help. But first you've got to let her go.
Martha!
Those people, who were they? Where did they take her?
He kept on saying three, we need three. What did he mean, three?
This motorway. How do I get there?
Word of advice, all of you. Cash up, close down and pack your bags.
Because as soon as I've found her, alive and well. And I will find her alive and well. Then I'm coming back, and this street is closing tonight!
Thanks. Sorry, I'm the Doctor.
Ah, that's nice. Hello. How old are they?
What, they were born in here?
What, you've been driving for two months?
I'm sorry?
Twelve years? How far did you come? Where did you start?
You travelled five miles in twelve years?
Never mind that. I've got to get out. My friend's in one of these cars. She was taken hostage. I should get back to the Tardis.
When's the next lay-by?
I need to talk to the police.
But you're the police.
Is there anyone else? I once met the Duke of Manhattan. Is there any way of getting through to him?
I've got to find my friend.
What about the other cars?
Hello. Sorry. I'm looking for someone called Martha Jones. She's been carjacked.
She's inside one of these vehicles, but I don't know which one.
Where were we?
Pharmacy Town
About twenty minutes ago.
Anything more specific?
Yes, she was, yeah.
That's it! So how do we find them?
Call them on this thing. We've got their number. Diamond six.
They put me on hold.
Thank you.
We've got to go to the fast lane. Take me down.
You've got three passengers.
She's alone and she's lost. She doesn't belong on this planet, and it's all my fault. I'm asking you, Brannigan, take me down.
Why not? What's the risk? What happens down there?
So we keep on driving.
For how long?
Mrs Cassini, this is the Doctor.
Tell me, how long have you been driving on the motorway?
And in all that
Time, have you ever seen a police car?
Look at your notes. Any police?
Or an ambulance?
Rescue service? Anything official. Ever.
What if there's no one out there?
Someone's got to ask, because you might not talk about it, but it's there in your eyes. What if the traffic jam never stops?
In that case, where are they, hmm? What if there's no help coming, not ever? What if there's nothing? Just the motorway, with the cars going round and round and round and round, never stopping. Forever.
If you won't take me, I'll go down on my own.
Finding my own way. I usually do.
Here we go.
Look after this. I love that coat. Janis Joplin gave me that coat.
If it's any consolation, Valerie, right now, I'm having kittens.
Hardly know her. I was too busy showing off. And I lied to her. Couldn't help it, just lied. Bye then.
Sorry, Motorway Foot Patrol. I'm doing a survey. How are you enjoying your motorway?
Thank you. Your comments have been noted. Have a nice day!
Thank you for your cooperation. Your comments have been noted. Do you mind if I borrow this?
Not my colour, but thank you very much.
Ooo! Don't mind me.
Sorry, Motorway Foot Patrol. Whatever. Have you got any water?
Is this the last layer?
Can we drive down?
Couldn't we just cheat?
Then excuse me.
No, I just want to look.
What's that noise?
What are those lights? What's down there? I just need to see.
There must be some sort of ventilation. If I could just transmit a pulse through this thing, maybe I could trip the system, give us a bit of a breeze.
That's it! Might shift the fumes a bit, give us a good look.
They're alive.
Macra.
The Macra used to be the scourge of this galaxy. Gas. They fed off gas, the filthier the better. They built up a small empire using humans as slaves and mining gas for food.
Well, that was billions of years ago. Billions. They must have devolved down the years. Now they're just beasts. But they're still hungry and my friend's down there.
I've invented a sport.
Do I know you?
Novice Hame! No, hold on, get off. Last time we met, you were breeding humans for experimentation.
I'm not going anywhere. You've got Macra living underneath this city. Macra! And if my friend's still alive, she's stuck down there.
No, no, no, you're coming with me. We've got three passengers now.
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!
Oh! Rough teleport. Ow. You can go straight back down and teleport people out, starting with Martha.
Then get some more! Where are we?
Good. Because you can tell the Senate of New New York I'd like a word. They have got thousands of people trapped on the motorway. Millions!
How long's it been like this?
All of them? Everyone? What happened?
So the whole thing down there is running on automatic.
Who's we? How did you survive?
The Face of Boe!
Old friend, what happened to you?
So he saved them.
But there are planets out there. You could have called for help.
So the two of you stayed here, on your own for all these years.
Yes, you did.
Car four six five diamond six. It still registers! That's Martha. I knew she was good. Novice Hame, hold that in place. Think, think, think, think. Take the residual energy, invert it, feed it through the electricity grid.
Oh, you've got power. You've got me. I'm brilliant with computers, just you watch. Hame, every switch on that bank up to maximum. I can't power up the city, but all the city needs is people.
This!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The transformers are blocked. The signal can't get through.
Yeah, hold on, not now.
Hame, look after him. Don't you go dying on me, you big old face. You've got to see this. The open road. Ha!
Sorry, no Sally Calypso. She was just a hologram. My name's the Doctor.
And this is an order. Everyone drive up. Right now.
I've opened the roof of the motorway. Come on. Throttle those engines. Drive up. All of you. The whole under-city. Drive up, drive up, drive up! Fast!
We've got to clear that fast lane. Drive up and get out of the way.
Oi! Car four six five diamond six. Martha! Drive up!
You've got access above. Now go!
You keep driving, Brannigan. All the way up. Because it's here, just waiting for you. The city of New New York, and it's yours. And don't forget I want that coat back.
And Car four six five diamond six, I've sent you a flight path. Come to the Senate.
It's been quite a while since I saw you, Martha Jones.
Over here.
It's the Face of Boe. It's all right. Come and say hello. And this is Hame. She's a cat. Don't worry. He's the one that saved you, not me.
No, don't say that. Not old Boe. Plenty of life left.
I don't even know. Legend says the Face of Boe has lived for billions of years. Isn't that right? And you're not about to give up now.
Don't. There's no need for that.
Yeah, but not yet. Who needs secrets, eh?
That's why we have to survive. Both of us. Don't go.
All closed down.
Happy happy. New New York can start again. And they've got Novice Hame. Just what every city needs. Cats in charge. Come on, time we were off.
I don't know.
I don't think so. Sorry.
Doesn't matter. Back to the Tardis, off we go.
All right, are you staying?
It really doesn't matter.
I lied to you, because I liked it. I could pretend. Just for a bit, I could imagine they were still alive, underneath a burnt orange sky. I'm not just a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords. The Face of Boe was wrong. There's no one else.
There was a war. A Time War. The last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. They lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family, my friends, even that sky. Oh, you should have seen it, that old planet. The second sun would rise in the south, and the mountains would shine. The leaves on the trees were silver, and when they caught the light every morning, it looked like a forest on fire. When the autumn came, the breeze would blow through the branches like a song.

Cardiff.
Ah, but the thing about Cardiff, it's built on a rift in time and space, just like California and the San Andreas Fault, but the rift bleeds energy. Every now and then I need to open up the engines, soak up the energy and use it as fuel.
Exactly. Should only take twenty seconds. The rift's been active.
Bit of trouble with the Slitheen.
A long time ago. Lifetimes. I was a different man back then.
Finito. All powered up.
We're accelerating into the future. The year one billion. Five billion. Five trillion. Fifty trillion? What? The year one hundred trillion? That's impossible.
We're going to the end of the universe.
Well, we've landed.
I don't know.
Not even the Time Lords came this far. We should leave. We should go. We should really, really go.
Hello again. Oh, I'm sorry.
I think he came with us.
Must have been clinging to the outside of the Tardis all the way through the vortex. Well, that's very him.
Friend of mine. Used to travel with me, back in the old days.
Oh, don't start.
Captain.
And you. Same as ever. Although, have you had work done?
Oh yes, the face. Regeneration. How did you know this was me?
Did I? Busy life. Moving on.
Oh, no! Sorry, she's alive.
Parallel world, safe and sound. And Mickey, and her mother.
Oh, excuse me. That is not time travel. It's like, I've got a sports car and you've got a space hopper.
Told you.
I was busy.
You two! We're at the end of the universe, all right? Right at the edge of knowledge itself and you're busy blogging! Come on.
A city or a hive, or a nest, or a conglomeration. Like it was grown. But look, there. That's like pathways, roads? Must have been some sort of life, long ago.
Time. Just time. Everything's dying now. All the great civilizations have gone. This isn't just night. All the stars have burned up and faded away into nothing.
Well, Martha and I, maybe. Not so sure about you, Jack.
I suppose we have to hope life will find a way.
Is it me, or does that look like a hunt? Come on!
Jack, don't you dare!
I've got a ship nearby. It's safe. It's not far, it's over there.
Or maybe not.
Silo?
He's not my responsibility.
Thanks for that.
It looks like a box, a big blue box. I'm sorry, but I really need it back. It's stuck out there.
Big, tall, wooden. Says Police.
Thank you.
Don't you see that? The ripe old smell of humans. You survived. Oh, you might have spent a million years evolving into clouds of gas, and another million as downloads, but you always revert to the same basic shape. The fundamental humans.
End of the universe and here you are. Indomitable! That's the word. Indomitable! Ha!
Stop it. Give us a hand with this. It's half deadlocked. I need you to overwrite the code. Let's find out where we are.
Thanks.
They're not refugees, they're passengers.
The perfect place. Hundred trillion years, it's the same old dream. You recognise those engines?
Boiling. But if the universe is falling apart, what does Utopia mean?
That's me.
It's good apparently.
Stop it.
And all this feeds into the rocket?
Well, er, basically, sort of, not a clue.
I'm not from around these parts. I've never seen a system like it. Sorry.
But that, that, that's my hand.
Long story. I lost my hand Christmas Day, in a swordfight.
Er, yeah, yeah, I did. Yeah. Hello.
Time Lord, last of. Heard of them? Legend or anything? Not even a myth? Blimey, end of the universe is a bit humbling.
Sorry, what was your name?
The city outside, that was yours?
Conglomeration. That's what I said.
Oh, yes. Sorry.
Hello, again. It's fine. Look, really, it's me.
Well.
And Utopia is?
Bit of a hermit.
Hermits United. We meet up every ten years and swap stories about caves. It's good fun, for a hermit. So, er, Utopia?
Where is that?
What do you think's out there?
Oh, yes.
And the signal keeps modulating, so it's not automatic. That's a good sign someone's out there. And that's, oh, that's a navigation matrix. So you can fly without stars to guide you. Professor? Professor? Professor.
You all right?
Except that rocket's not going to fly, is it? This footprint mechanism thing, it's not working.
You're stuck on this planet. And you haven't told them, have you? That lot out there, they still think they're going to fly.
Quite right, too. And I must say, Professor er, what was it?
Professor Yana. This new science is well beyond me, but all the same, a boost reversal circuit, in any time frame, must be a circuit which reverses the boost. So, I wonder, what would happen if I did this?
Oh, we've been chatting away, I forgot to tell you. I'm brilliant.
Is this?
That's food. You've built this system out of food and string and staples? Professor Yana, you're a genius.
Oh, it's easy coming in at the end, but you're stellar. This is, this is magnificent. And I don't often say that because, well, because of me.
If you'd been born in a different time, you'd be revered. I mean it. Throughout the galaxies.
Well, you've got it now. But that footprint engine thing. You can't activate it from onboard. It's got to be from here. You're staying behind.
You'd give your life so they could fly.
Ah!
Professor, it's a wild stab in the dark, but I may just have found you a way out.
Extra power. Little bit of a cheat, but who's counting? Jack, you're in charge of the retro feeds.
You don't have to keep working. We can handle it.
What sort of noise?
When did it start?
Where is that room?
Stet? Never heard of it.
Radiation's rising!
Jack, override the vents!
Don't! It's going to flare!
The chamber's flooded with radiation, yes?
Oh, I don't know. Martha, leave him.
Come on, come on, just listen to me. Now leave him alone. It strikes me, Professor, you've got a room which no man can enter without dying. Is that correct?
Well
I think I've got just the man.
Lieutenant, get on board the rocket! I promise you're going to fly.
Trust me. We've found a way of tripping the system. Run!
What are you taking your clothes off for?
Well, by the looks of it, I'd say the stet radiation doesn't affect clothing, only flesh.
Ever since I ran away from you. Good luck.
Receiving, yeah. He's inside.
Oh, yes.
When did you first realise?
That's why I left you behind. It's not easy even just looking at you, Jack, because you're wrong.
You are. I can't help it. I'm a Time Lord. It's instinct. It's in my guts. You're a fixed point in time and space. You're a fact. That's never meant to happen. Even the Tardis reacted against you, tried to shake you off. Flew all the way to the end of the universe just to get rid of you.
I never thought of it like that.
Yeah.
Rose.
She came back. Opened the heart of the Tardis and absorbed the time vortex itself.
No one's ever mean to have that power.
If a Time Lord did that, he'd become a god. A vengeful god. But she was human.
Everything she did was so human. She brought you back to life but she couldn't control it. She brought you back forever. That's something, I suppose. The final act of the Time War was life.
Time war, time war.
I took the power out of her.
She's gone, Jack. She's not just living on a parallel world, she's trapped there. The walls have closed.
Yeah.
Do you want to die?
Jack?
You might be out there, somewhere.
Well, the only man you're ever going to be happy with.
Hmm.
Martha, this watch is me. I'm going to become human.
Now, get out of there. Come on!
Lieutenant, everyone on board?
Stand by. Two minutes to ignition.
Ah, nearly there. The footprint, it's a gravity pulse. It stamps down, the rocket shoots up. Bit primitive. It'll take the both of us to keep it stable.
Don't be ridiculous.
No, no, no, it's this, this thing, this device, it rewrites biology. Changes a Time Lord into a human.
It can't be.
Jack, keep it level!
Yes, it is. Course it is. Depends which one. Brilliant, fantastic, yeah. But they died, the Time Lords. All of them. They died.
What did he say, Martha? What did he say?
What about now? Can he see it now?
The Tardis. The time vortex.
Lieutenant, have you done it? Did you get velocity? Have you done it? Lieutenant, have you done it?
Good luck.
Get it open! Get it open!
Professor! Professor, let me in! Let me in! Jack, get the door open now!
Professor! Professor, where are you?! Professor! Professor, are you there? Please, I need to explain. Whatever you do, don't open that watch.
Professor!
Open the door, please! I'm begging you, Professor. Please, listen to me.
Just open the door, please.
Let me in. Let me in!
I'm begging you. Everything's changed! It's only the two of us! We're the only ones left! Just let me in!
I'm asking you really properly. Just stop. Just think!
Master. I'm sorry.

We're by the seaside, that's where we are. That's all that matters.
Oh, stop fussing, you two. Come on.
Come on, you two. No, wait a minute. See if there's any buckets and spades in the Tardis.
Come on in, the water's lovely. You don't know what you're missing.
Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up.
That's not a boat, it's a hovercraft.
It's a hovercraft. It floats on the air instead of the sea.
No, it's true, Jamie.
Oh, yes. Yes. I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go.
Come on, run.
Don't argue, run. Come on.
Come on!
Why indeed? Well, what now?
No, we'd never make it. There's not much cover here.
They're human beings, if that's what you mean, indulging their favourite past time. Trying to destroy each other.
Time we went. Come on.
You must. It's our only chance.
Come on!
A very timely and welcome rescue.
It's a helicopter, Jamie.
A chopper. You know, a whirly bird.
No, no, no. It's a primitive form of flying machine.
Wait. You're hurt.
Jamie, give her a hand.
Come along inside.
Now let's have a look at it. You're not, and please don't argue. Victoria? Bring some warm water will you?
Go and fetch it, will you, Jamie?
Come and sit down.
We'll see. Oh, yes.
You mean you don't know?
Well you went to such a great deal of trouble to save us. Ah, there we are. Thank you, Jamie.
Well, not of any medical significance.
Which law? Whose philosophies, eh?
Am I?
Septic spray. That should be right.
You'll run out of doctors in a minute. Now, you haven't told us your name yet.
Ah, Miss Ferrier, this is Victoria and this is Jamie.
Now, this won't take a minute. I just want to clean it off. Be as gentle as I can. There we are. Who are these men? Why are they so determined to kill us?
Me? I'm the nicest possible person.
They seem remarkably dedicated.
There.
Tell me, Miss Ferrier, do you hate me?
Anything, anything at all.
Oh, that's, that's comforting, anyway. What is it that you want me to do?
I don't think so, Miss Ferrier. No, I'm sorry.
There's a great deal of harm in it. You don't suppose Miss Ferrier saved our skins for our sakes, do you? Now what is it you want us for?
Who is he?
Salamander?
It's too late!
I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know.
Oh, thank you.
Well, my friends and I, we've been out of touch of civilisation for a little while. We're visitors, so to speak. On ice, shall we say.
At the beginning, please. We've been subjected to a number of attacks because I look like this Salamander of yours.
I quite agree, Victoria. He seems to be a public benefactor. Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome, didn't you think so Jamie?
Oh yes, well of course, we've heard something.
Yes, a rather different principle, I think, Jamie, but
You have proof of this?
But you could be making up stories about Salamander out of revenge.
Known by who?
Well, why don't you tell the authorities, the police or whatever?
Surely there is someone you can take your story to?
Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands whether to believe Mister Kent or not.
Oh, how?
Yes, I thought that's what we were leading up to.
Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice?
Only the accent? My dear young lady. Oh, dear. Now, what was it he said. (tries an imitation) We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all. No. Guarantee. No, no. Guaran. Guarantee. You see, it's very difficult. Of course, I always was interested in phonetics. Holidays. Summer. Summer. He must have come from Mexico. Quintana Roo or Yucatan I shouldn't wonder.
Yes, there are other very strong influences though. Oh, I could do it in time. But what if I did? What then?
I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four.
But that's out of the question!
But isn't there another way out of this?
Yes.
I won't! I can't!
No, no, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here? Don't push me.
You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off!
(mexican) Why, hello, Bruce. What are you doing here, huh?
(mexican) That's what you were meant to believe.
I do not care to be questioned by my own security.
You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.
Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.
Holding me?
No one threatens Salamander.
Yes, of course. You shall have it. But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone.
I am prepared to accept his story.
That's interesting, but not important. I accept it, that's all that matters.
You still dare to question me? They have information. I shall get it. I will see you on my return. Now leave me.
(normal) Must be the way you look, Jamie.
Thank you.
I don't know where you stand, Mister Kent, but you and this Salamander are obviously on opposite sides. That at least is clear. But which side is good? Which side is bad? And why should I interfere?
Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet. What do you think?
How do you propose we do that?
That man Bruce said that he was in the Central European Zone.
Well, what then?
Oh that's very clever of you. How can you do that? I thought you said you had no official position.
He must be a very important person.
Oh, I see. What about me?
Yes. Yes, but from a safe distance, of course.
Oh yes.
Disused Yeti?
Good luck, Astrid. Jamie and Victoria will look after you.
Well, I'm sorry.
But why make earthquakes?
What you're saying is that Salamander's found a way of harnessing the natural forces of the earth. It's a little difficult to accept. I'm not saying it's impossible, mind you. You say it's coming from the Research Station. Salamander's Research Station, eh?
What made you suspicious?
But that's valuable evidence!
A sort of Jekyll and Hyde character, perhaps, our Mister Salamander. It'll be interesting to see what report Jamie brings back.
I hope there's plenty of air in here.
Unpleasant, yes, destructive, but not necessarily evil.
It is too important. I must be sure. Oh dear. What pretty crockery this is. Sad really, isn't it? People spend all their time making nice things, and other people come along and break them.
Facts, Kent. I must have facts. That's what I hope Jamie's going to bring back.
Patience, Mister Kent, patience.
Oh, perhaps her plan to infiltrate into Salamander's organisation has failed.
Can't you contact her?
Well, your friend Benik did indicate we weren't entirely welcome here, you know.
Oh, thank you. Well, I suggest we give her another hour, and then if she doesn't contact us by then, we'll move out and find out what has happened.
But what are they going to do to Jamie and Victoria?
What, to his headquarters, the Research Centre?
How far will he go to get it?
Oh, that's very comforting.
Yes, I'm not quite clear about your part in all this. You work for Salamander, suddenly you fall over yourself to betray him.
Why?
Oh, no, no, no, of course not, my dear. Well, nobody's perfect, Kent. But I still can't help wondering why
Well, you were in a unique position to do so.
Proof! Proof! Proof! It always comes back to the same thing. No one has any evidence against Salamander!
Not enough! It's not enough! Salamander covers up too well.
But that's wonderful. Let me see. I'll give it to you back. Thank you.
Oh, yes. Yes.
But I'm afraid this still isn't evidence. It's not real evidence.
Oh, I'm not saying that.
But I still don't know if I can carry it off.
Yes.
Oh, I see. Yes, of course, there are conditions, aren't there? You help me, I defeat Salamander.
What you really want me to do is to kill him, isn't it?
Private justice, eh? Oh no, no. I'll expose him, ruin him, have him arrested, but I won't be his executioner. No one has that right.
No!
You can't bargain with people's lives like that!
Why?
Well, what is it?
Well, isn't there another way out of here?
More down there, too.
What's that?
But where does it go?
Oh no, what about you?
But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah.
Well, we must find her! You don't seem to realise how vital it is.
Sorry.
Yes, it's not bad.
Well, perhaps it's Fariah.
I beg your pardon?
But that's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that.
Well, well, yes.
Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner. I was going to attempt to rescue them.
We do hold evidence that Salamander isn't quite so pure and white as he's painted.
A file, containing certain information about a gentleman called Fedorin.
Fariah has it. Salamander's food taster.
Dead? But how?
Oh, that's terrible.
Please, Mister Kent! You're forgetting one very important thing.
Me. Without me you haven't got an earthly chance of getting in that control centre.
I told you before. I will not have anything to do with violence.
No, I am not. May I?
Please? Just trust me.
Now then, I think you agree that at this moment your life is in my hands.
It's all right. Mister Bruce isn't going to shoot anyone, are you?
Because I think I know what sort of man you are. Honest and reasonable.
I gave you back that gun because I trust you. Now I want you to trust me.
Well, I'm afraid you will have to make up your mind to that right away.
Your confidence.
I think there's reasonable doubt about Salamander's personal integrity, but there's only one way to get proof.
Yes. And my two young friends may have some information.
Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us and put us in prison, won't you?
And what's that?
Oh, Victoria, don't hit me! You wouldn't hit your old friend the Doctor, would you? I wouldn't leave you in the tender mercy of Salamander.
You don't believe me. Oh.
Only you made me leave it in the Tardis.
Well, it's a little place that we three have in common. You must admit they thought I was Salamander to begin with.
No, but there's enough doubt in your mind to make you go on asking questions, isn't there? That's why we came here.
Yes, that's what I believe.
I'm sure we'll find proof in the Records Room.
Ah. Well, we shall have to wait until he comes out, won't we, hmm?
(as Salamander) Really, Benik, I'm beginning to wondering why I pay you such a monstrously high salary. Worrying me over trifles. Make your own decision. Is that all?
What, now?
Oh, very well.
Yes?
Yes.
I'm going mad. I left it in there. What a fool.
Yes, do that, will you? Right away. Oh, please don't wait for these.
(normal) That was close.
I don't know.
I hope not. But he's done us a good turn in bringing me these. This'll interest you, Bruce. How many people do you say work in the research centre?
A dozen, eh? Will you tell me why thirty people are catered for here?
This is Salamander. I want a security escort to come to the interrogation room immediately. I am releasing two prisoners. They are to be conducted to the main gates and set free. Is that understood? Good.
(normal) Well, I hope that works.
(as Salamander) Salamander. (listens) Is the, is the pass in order? Very well, you have my authority.
(normal) We have a visitor. Now, Bruce, you're going to get your proof, but I want you to do one thing.
I want you to take my two friends to the gates and see they get away all right.
You are to go straight to the Tardis as soon as you can.
Shh.
(normal) Well, that's very interesting, Mister Kent. Why didn't you tell me that before?
Oh, I'm afraid it is. Oh, look. Here's another surprise for you. Look behind you.
You see, Kent
You didn't fool me, Kent.
Any man who resorts to murder as eagerly and as rapidly as you must be suspect. You didn't just want to expose Salamander, you wanted to kill him and take his place.
Stop him. Stop him. He's going to try and blow the place up!
No! Don't touch that door, it's red hot.
Well, it's locked. They're trying to burn through from the other side.
It looks like some sort of cave.
Yes. I wonder if he knows Kent's on his way?
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me out there? Bruce?
Can you hear me?
Oh, there you are. I think Kent is going to try to blow us up. Any chance of getting us out of here? Things are going to turn rather nasty in a minute.
Oh. Well, if you can't, you'd better leave with your men. There's no point in us all going up in smoke.
Let's get out of here.
They may have been killed.
There's a TV monitor screen in there. There must be a link to the deep shelter.
Oh good, that's splendid. I'll come too.
Oh, yes. Oh.
No, I'm all right. I'll come with you as far as the gates. Come on, we must go.
Quite right, Jamie.
Welcome to the Tardis.
And Giles Kent?
We're going to put you outside, Salamander. No friends, no safety, nothing. You'll run, but they'll catch up with you.
No!
Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something!
Jamie! Oh!

Right then, Rose Tyler, you tell me. Where do you want to go? Backwards or forwards in time. It's your choice. What's it going to be?
How far?
There you go. Step outside those doors, it's the twenty second century.
That's a bit boring, though. Do you want to go further?
Ten thousand years in the future. Step outside, it's the year 12005, the new Roman Empire.
I am so impressive.
Right then, you asked for it. I know exactly where to go. Hold on!
You lot, you spend all your time thinking about dying, like you're going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or asteroids. But you never take time to imagine the impossible, that maybe you survive. This is the year five point five slash apple slash twenty six. Five billion years in your future, and this is the day
Hold on.
This is the day the Sun expands. Welcome to the end of the world.
Depends what you mean by people.
Aliens.
It's not really a spaceship, more like an observation deck. The great and the good are gathering to watch the planet burn.
Fun.
Mind you, when I said the great and the good, what I mean is, the rich.
Millions, but the planet's now property of the National Trust. They've been keeping it preserved. See down there? Gravity satellites holding back the sun.
They did, and the Trust shifted them back. That's a classic Earth. But now the money's run out, nature takes over.
About half an hour and then the planet gets roasted.
I'm not saving it. Time's up.
It's empty. They're all gone. No one left.
Oh, that's nice, thanks.
That's me. I'm a guest. Look, I've got an invitation. Look. There, you see? It's fine, you see? The Doctor plus one. I'm the Doctor, this is Rose Tyler. She's my plus one. Is that all right?
The paper's slightly psychic. It shows them whatever I want them to see. Saves a lot of time.
Yeah.
DOCTOR Thank you. Yes, gifts. Er, I give you in return air from my lungs.
There's more where that came from.
The Moxx of Balhoon.
Thank you very much.
Ah! The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. I bring you air from my lungs.
Oi, now, careful with that. Park it properly. No scratches.
Rose? Are you in there?
Aye, aye. What do you think, then?
Good thing I didn't take you to the Deep South.
All over the place.
No, you just hear English. It's a gift of the Tardis. The telepathic field, gets inside your brain and translates.
Well, in a good way.
I didn't think about it like that.
I'm just the Doctor.
Well, it's not as if you'll know where it is!
What does it matter?
This is who I am, right here, right now, all right? All that counts is here and now, and this is me.
Tell you what.
With a little bit of jiggery pokery.
Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery. What about you?
Oh. There you go.
Think that's amazing, you want to see the bill.
Bundle of laughs, you are.
That's not supposed to happen.
That wasn't a gravity pocket. I know gravity pockets and they don't feel like that. What do you think, Jabe? Listened to the engines. They've pitched up about thirty Hertz. That dodgy or what?
Where's the engine room?
She's not my wife.
No.
Nope.
Don't start a fight.
I'm all yours.
Who's in charge of Platform One? Is there a Captain or what?
You mean the computer? But who controls that?
But there's no one from the Corporation on board.
Unsinkable?
You're telling me. I was on board another ship once. They said that was unsinkable. I ended up clinging to an iceberg. It wasn't half cold. So, what you're saying is, if we get in trouble there's no one to help us out?
Fantastic.
So tell me, Jabe, what's a tree like you doing in a place like this?
Oh, come on. Everyone on this platform's worth zillions.
In case your share prices drop? I know you lot. You've got massive forests everywhere, roots everywhere, and there's always money in land.
Excuse me.
Is it me, or is it a bit nippy?
Fair do's, though, that's a great bit of air conditioning. Sort of nice and old fashioned. Bet they call it retro.
Gotcha.
What the hell's that?
I don't think so. Hold on.
Hey, nice liana.
Don't worry, I won't tell anybody. Now then, who's been bringing their pets on board?
Sabotage.
And the temperature's about to rocket. Come on.
Hold on. Get back.
You can smell him. Hold on, there's another sun filter programmed to descend.
Anyone in there?
Oh, well, it would be you.
Hold on. Give us two ticks.
Just what we need.
The computer's getting clever.
I'm not mucking about. It's fighting back.
I know!
The whole thing's jammed. I can't open the doors. Stay there!
Don't move!
Easy way of finding out. Someone bought their little pet on board. Let's send him back to master.
That's all very well, and really kind of obvious, but if you stop and think about it
A Repeated Meme is just an idea. And that's all they are, an idea.
Remote controlled Droids. Nice little cover for the real troublemaker. Go on, Jimbo. Go home.
What are you going to do, moisturise me?
Sabotaging a ship while you're still inside it? How stupid's that?
Five billion years and it still comes down to money.
No. We can do it by hand. There must be a system restore switch. Jabe, come on. You lot, just chill.
Oh. And guess where the switch is.
You can't. The heat's going to vent through this place.
Jabe, you're made of wood.
Raise shields!
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm full of ideas, I'm bristling with them. Idea number one, teleportation through five thousand degrees needs some kind of feed. Idea number two, this feed must be hidden nearby.
Idea number three, if you're as clever as me, then a teleportation feed can be reversed.
The last human.
People have died, Cassandra. You murdered them.
And creak?
Creak. You're creaking.
You raised the temperature.
Everything has its time and everything dies.
Come with me.
You think it'll last forever, people and cars and concrete, but it won't. One day it's all gone. Even the sky. My planet's gone. It's dead. It burned like the Earth. It's just rocks and dust before it's time.
There was a war and we lost.
I'm a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords. They're all gone. I'm the only survivor. I'm left travelling on my own 'cos there's no one else.
You've seen how dangerous it is. Do you want to go home?
Yeah. Yeah.
Me too.
No money.

We're not where we're supposed to be.
I don't know. There are traces of anti-matter.
Oh, highly unlikely he's still alive. It's not a navigational malfunction either.
No, no, there's no danger, although it's puzzling. It's very puzzling.
Well, at least we can breath the air. I suppose that's something. You look different.
The question is, how did we get here?
Former homeworld?
No, no, the other one.
This is serious. Someone's been playing around. Who set the coordinates?
No, no, no. Earlier, I was trying to teach both of you to read the star charts. Now, one of you actually read out the coordinates for me to set. Who was it?
It was Tegan.
The dream? What dream?
But you've had this dream, this particular dream, before.
Haven't you?
Always the same dream?
But the same feelings of fear remain.
She means it. I think she could be right.
Now then, Tegan, where are we?
Very simple question, where are we?
No, we're not. So?
Think!
Please, Tegan, think. Reach into the back of your mind.
Good.
Yes, we are.
Manussa, formerly homeworld of the Sumaran Empire which may or may not ring a bell. Does it, Tegan? The Sumaran Empire?
Yes. We must recover Tegan's dream, and simple hypnosis is the quickest way.
Dreams are important, Nyssa. Never underestimate them. Once a man fell asleep, dreamt he was a frog. When he woke up he didn't know if he was a man who dreamt he was a frog, or a frog who was now dreaming he was a man.
We'll have to see.
It does seem likely. I'm sorry.
Well, obviously below the threshold of conscious thought. I would imagine that when awake your mind is still strong enough to resist, but in sleep it loosens its grip and battle is joined.
Yes.
For control. Come over here.
It's possible the Mara seized temporary control and brought itself home. Now, insert the earpiece, try to relax, and when switched on, listen to the sound.
Where are you now?
What are you doing there?
You must go deeper, Tegan. Much deeper. Where are you now?
How old are you?
Tegan, now you must leave your garden.
And go still deeper. Deeper and further. Much further. Can you hear me? Now, I want you to go into the dream.
Why not?
Tegan, you're perfectly safe. You must go into the dream. Where are you now?
Out where?
Go in.
Tegan, you must go into the cave. We need to know what's there.
Tegan.
You're perfectly safe. You must look. We need to know what is there.
The Mara, speaking through Tegan's mouth.
It does, as mental resistance weakens. But this time I can prevent it.
With this. It inhibits the production of brainwaves associated with dreaming.
We must find the cave, the snake mouth in the dream.
Oh, yes. What's more, I would guess it's somewhere nearby.
Now, she will be experiencing total exclusion of all outside sound, so you must be her ears.
Dreams are occurring in the mind all the time. Come on, we must hurry.
I was right. It seems there's a cave system near by that fits the description. It's, er, this way.
Extraordinary, isn't it.
It's the cave from her dream.
Now, there's nothing to be frightened of.
Well, you'll have to stay with her. I'll go into the cave alone.
No, I'm afraid it's not.
There's no need for this.
Director? Director of what?
Are you indeed? Then you may be able to help
At present it exists as a latent mental force in the mind of my companion.
It's using her dreams to increase its power. Eventually it will take over her mind altogether, but I've put together a device to inhibit this temporarily.
Why don't you come and meet her? She's outside.
Certainly. Follow me.
Nyssa!
Nyssa, what's the matter?
What!
Where?
Come on.
Oh, this is hopeless. What state was she in?
Well, let's go back to the Tardis. She might try and find her way back there.
Well, as long as she's wearing the anti-dream device she should be safe.
I don't know. I just don't know. Why has the Mara returned? Why now, after so long? What does it want?
We don't know nearly enough. Without more information we are simply blundering around in the dark.
No, no, no. This is the Mara's homeworld. The answers we need are out there. I'll try the Director of the Research Institute, and you look for Tegan in the market. We'll meet back here.
Er, hello.
Do you?
Look
What ceremony?
When is it to be held?
Impossible! It must be called off. At least until my companion is found.
What?
Look, the facts are these. First of all, my companion brought us here, to this world, without ever having been here before. Now why should she do that? Why here, why now? Then I used hypnosis to establish the presence of the Mara in her head. You see, she has a recurring dream
And in this dream. What is it?
The Legend of the Return?
Well, tell me! Look, all I want's a little information. What possible harm is there in that?
Tell me about the legend.
To the Dark Places of the Inside.
I'm so sorry. Do go on.
What does it want?
The Great Crystal?
How can minds meet?
What is it?
Try it on.
Try it on.
Please. I want to show you something, then I'll go and leave you in peace.
Now, count the faces again.
And one makes six. The sixth Face of Delusion is the wearer's own. That was probably the idea, don't you think?
What is it?
Indeed.
Why are you telling me this?
Do you believe in the Legends?
One more question. Who are the Snake Dancers?
Nyssa!
Well, where is she now?
Was she marked?
On her arm. The mark of the snake.
It must be the Mara. Come on.
Come on.
Facts, Nyssa, facts. There's something I noticed before. I need to take another look.
The pictograms. There's a ceremony taking place commemorating the supposed destruction of the Mara.
The Mara's waited a long time for this return. I think it plans to be spectacular.
There! Now look. What do you make of that? There in the centre. Could that represent the Great Crystal?
And these lines from the centre, energy of some sort?
What?
Hmm. Minds meet in the Great Crystal. But what are these? Now, everything in this pictogram tells us something if we know how to read it, so what are these?
Hmm?
Obvious.
The Great Crystal, the Great Mind's Eye. That's the clue! The lines do represent the flow of mental energy, but not going to the individual figures, coming from them.
Just as a lens focuses the rays of the sun, the Great Mind's Eye gathered all the individual thought energies and concentrated them, and amplified them, and redirected them there.
Now, according to the Legend, the Great Crystal is the source of the Mara's power. But where is it now? What exactly were its properties? Oh, if only we could take a look at the Great Crystal itself. Unless, I wonder.
Come on, over there. Now, sit down.
Just think about it.
Sit down.
Now, simple test. The Great Crystal focuses thought in some way. Now, if this is the same sort of crystal, it should exhibit the same properties. We must direct our thoughts at it and observe what happens.
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
We'll try another way.
Hmm? I'm adjusting the frequency. I need to eliminate all unnecessary outside noise as an aid to concentration. There. Right, let's try again. You come and stand over here, watch the crystal closely and observe any changes. You ready?
Right.
Well, of course, it's small. It's power is obviously limited.
You're missing the point, Nyssa. It's not what you saw but that you saw anything at all. It proves the crystal has the quality of transforming thought into energy.
Perhaps even into matter itself. Just think of the power the Great Crystal must have. Whatever's in your thought, whatever in your mind, it can actually make it occur.
Exactly. The Mara needs the Great Crystal in order to make itself reoccur. Er, stay here.
To warn Ambril. He knows where the Great Crystal is now. He must be made to listen.
I do assure you it is most important. Where is the Great Mind's Eye?
The Great Crystal from the snake in the chamber.
You know where it is.
Where?
The Great Crystal is the source of the Mara's power. It needs that power to make itself reoccur. That's why it has returned.
Through the Great Crystal the Mara will reoccur as a physical fact here on Manussa!
How long am I to be locked up here?
Well, come on, surely at least you can tell me that?
That will be too late. Whatever is to happen will happen at the ceremony.
Do you think I'm inventing all this? What would I have to gain?
But you're not sure it is all nonsense, are you.
Why did you tell me about the Crystal?
What happened to Dojjen?
I do not want any more blankets! I want to get out of here. Tell your master I want to see him.
Nyssa!
Oh, it's no use, Nyssa. I have tried.
The lock is extremely primitive. It's practically a museum piece. There's no electronic impulse matrix to decode, no sonic microcircuit to disrupt. Crude mechanical six barrel movement, key operated. Primitive but adequate. Well, it's more than adequate, actually, because the key is what we don't have.
Quickly.
Have you come to let me out?
I'd much rather you unlocked the door and let me out.
Why, don't you have the key?
Ambril, I suppose.
Has the key in his room.
No, wait, wait. Of course I'm interested. The last page, you say?
It's a reference to the Great Mind's Eye.
Before he what?
Before he what?
Why, what was the function of the Dance?
What kind of powers?
Yes, of course.
So, Dojjen believed the legend of the Mara to such an extent that he gave up everything, went up into the hills to purify himself in readiness.
Shush.
What do you suggest?
How?
Well, we haven't, so for the time being we must make use of what we do have.
This.
Well?
This is a record of a journey, a private mental journey. Now, he must have discovered something that finally decided him.
Oh, I don't know. The Mara, the history of the planet, the origins of this crystal.
What?
Yes, of course, I should have realised. Structurally perfect. It has to be free of all flaws and distortions. Even the minute distortions produced by the effects of gravity.
The crystals were designed and built by a people who had mastered the techniques of molecular engineering in a zero gravity environment.
No, and according to Chela this crystal is eight hundred years old.
Not necessarily. I suspect that when they built the Great Crystal they overlooked one vital factor. The nature of the mental energy would determine the nature of the matter created. The Great Crystal absorbed what was in their minds. The restlessness, the hatred, the greed. Absorbed it, amplified it, reflected it.
Indeed. And in the reign of evil which followed they must have forgotten the most important thing of all, that the Mara was something they themselves had blindly brought into being.
Only some of it. The rest he must have learned from the Snake Dancers who kept the knowledge alive, hidden in traditions and legends.
He didn't know exactly when, and nobody would listen, just as no one will listen to us.
Good question. I don't know.
We wait.
Patience.
I think he will.
No.
Well done!
What made you change your mind?
You're forgetting Tegan.
Back the way we came.
All right, all right, we give in.
Your mother is right.
My only concern is for Tegan and the Great Crystal.
If I'm allowed to live long enough, I'll explain.
You must not do that.
But why?
Why did you request it, and why did he agree?
Who said we wanted to assassinate you?
No, of course not. How foolish of me. I've been very stupid. Do you remember me telling you, Nyssa, on the Kinda world, the mark of the Mara? I should have realised.
Where's Tegan? What have you done with her?
You won't succeed. In the end, evil never does.
Now!
Come on, there's no time for that!
To find Tegan.
Tegan won't die until the Mara within her is free.
Same reason as Tegan. He still has a lot of his own personality.
Very much so.
Come on.
In here.
What is it?
Custom?
Or what?
I'm afraid I don't have a coin.
I wish it was that easy.)
How long have we got? When does the actual ceremony begin?
How long?
I wonder if there's still time. There must be. It's our only hope. Come on.
Change of plan. To find Dojjen.
Come on.
It's not as simple as that.
We wouldn't be preventing the Mara's return, only postponing it. It would continue to exist as a mental force. No, this time we must destroy it completely.
I don't know.
I hope so.
You're forgetting we do have this.
It won't. It will help him find us. Trust me.
This should be fine.
Sympathetic resonance.
Thought directed at this crystal should set up a resonance which is picked up and echoed by another.
Well, the Snake Dancers wear these, don't they?
Hopefully.
Now we wait.
Good question. Nyssa asked exactly the same thing.
I don't know. Perhaps we'll find that out too.
I'm afraid we have no choice if we're to have any hope of saving Tegan.
Yes, I do know.
It's the poison. The effect of the poison.
DOCTOR [OC] Fear is.
How, how can, I must save Tegan. It was my fault, so how, how can. Destroyed. How can the Mara? It was my fault.
What is the Snake Dance?
The still point? The point of safety? A place in the chamber somewhere. Where?
Thought what? No, I survived.
I don't know. Somehow he saw me through.
Yes, of course. The ceremony.
I think I did, we'll have to see. I just hope we're not too late.
Come on, jump.
Well, let's hope we're not too late.
Come on, come on. Hurry up.
Now!
You left that a bit late.
No! No!
No! No more, you must not look! The Mara is feeding off the fear and panic. It needs it. You must not believe what you see. The Great Crystal is absorbing the belief and creating the Mara. Don't look! Reach inside yourselves and find the still point. Oh Nyssa, Nyssa.
No, I will not submit.
Thank you.
It's all right. It's all over now.
Well, you're free of it now.
Yes. The Mara has been destroyed.

So?
You know, really, Jo, I'm obviously wasting my time trying to turn you into a scientist.
How? Well, I just know, that's all. Everything that happens in life must have a scientific explanation. If you know where to look for it, that is. Excuse me.
You know, Jo, for a reasonably intelligent young lady, you do have the most absurd ideas.
Bessie, how dare you go gallivanting around like that.
Are you sorry?
Very well, I forgive you. Now go back to your parking place before I change my mind.
Would you believe magic?
Hmm.
Well, Jo would.
Well, you explain it then.
Naturally. Or should I say scientifically. Solenoids and a solar mechanism in Bessie and
A radio control unit here. You see how easy it is to be a magician?
Would you like me to show you some more then?
Coming where?
Oh, not you too, Captain Yates?
Captain Yates, you astound me.
What did you say?
Devil's End? Devil's End?
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.
To see that TV programme, of course.
Let's see what he has to say.
Beltane. Of course.
You know, there's something dreadfully wrong here.
I don't know. Aquarius? The Devil's Hump? Beltane?
Come on, think, think!
Come on, Jo.
Devil's End, of course. That woman is perfectly right. We've got to stop that lunatic before it's too late.
It's no good, we're hopelessly lost.
Well, if we had, we would have been there by now. You must have missed one.
If you look at the map the right way up, we might eventually get there. Now, which way is it?
Thank you very much.
That's quite all right. We don't want a drink, just the directions to the Devil's Hump.
Yes, yes, I know, but would you please tell us the way? This is very urgent.
I can assure you, sir, it will be no such thing.
I am no sort of chap, sir.
Wig?
Look, there is no time for all these unnecessary questions
I want to go up to the Devil's Hump because I want to stop that lunatic Professor of your from bringing devastation upon you all.
Is nobody here capable of answering a perfectly simple enquiry? What's the matter with you all?
Fuss? I've never heard such balderdash in all
Excellent. Thank you very much.
It's no good, we're just wasting time. Come on. If we run we'll just make it.
Stop! Stop that dig! Stop it!
Stop! Don't pull that stone! Don't!
Eureka!
Jo. Jo, please, stop fussing.
Look, I tell you, I am perfectly all right. It was a bit parky up there for a while, I'll admit, but it soon warmed up.
Yes, the final confirmation of my theory.
Yes, I think so.
No, not just yet. I want to wait until I'm absolutely sure. Right, I'm going back up to the dig.
Fortunately, no. Captain Yates, you'd better wait here, all right? (Hawthorne enters, carrying Benton.)
Get him over to that bench, quickly!
Yes, it's all right. I am a Doctor.
Well, there are no bones broken or anything. Look, could you get me some hot water and some hot sweet tea, perhaps?
Thank you very much. And thank you too, Miss Hawthorne.
Yes, of course. It's a great pity they didn't listen to you in the first place.
Elementals?
You saw the Devil?
And what did he look like?
Look, Miss Hawthorne, I agreed with you from the first about the danger, but now I think you're utterly mistaken. Whatever else you saw it certainly was not the Devil.
Nonsense, Jo. Miss Hawthorne, who is the leader of this cult?
Magister. Yes, of course, I should have known.
Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Magister is the Latin word for Master!
Right. Get the saw, will you?
Poor fellow.
Well, it certainly wasn't the Devil. At least, not exactly.
Look, I'm going in. Would you prefer to wait outside?
No, of course not. I'd be glad of the company. Come on.
If my theory's right, we're all in mortal danger.
Everyone in the whole world. Ah. (He sees something on the floor and brushes the soil away.)
Metal.
That's right. Except that it isn't a model.
Jo, look at the shape of this tomb.
A different size, that's all. Now you try picking it up.
The reason why you can't pick it up is that is weighs about seven hundred and fifty tons, at a rough guess.
Be serious. All right. About a hundred thousand years ago
Hold this!
Clokleda partha mennin klatch.
Phew.
Iron. It's an old magical defence.
I don't, but he did. Luckily.
No, it's the first line of an old Venusian lullaby, as a matter of fact. Roughly translated it goes, 'Close your eyes, my darling. Well, three of them, at least'.
I must admit, that thing took me completely by surprise.
It looked like a gargoyle made of stone.
In a sense, yes.
No, the creature she saw must have been a hundred times more hideous.
No, not your mythical devil, Jo, no, but something far more real and far more dangerous.
Oh, thank you, Miss Hawthorne. Let me help you.
You've all been asking me for explanations. Perhaps these will help me to provide them.
Nonsense.
There's nothing more real than a forcefield, Sergeant, even a psionic one.
Science.
Science, Miss Hawthorne.
Well done, Jo. You're being logical at last. I'll turn you into a scientist yet. Right, if there are no more interruptions, I'll tell you what it is.
Give me that. Hello, Lethbridge Stewart? The Doctor here. What about going over the top of it?
Or we're locked in. All right, Brigadier, we'll keep in touch.
Right, that's it. Now, as you can see, we're smack in the middle of a sort of lethal mushroom, about ten miles across and a mile high.
Yes, all right. Jo, Captain Yates, would you mind drawing the curtains?
Come on, Jo, stir your stumps. Now then. All right? Now then, tell me. Who's that?
Top of the class, Jo, top of the class. That's right, that's the Egyptian god Khnum, with horns. There's another one, a Hindu demon.
Oh. Thank you very much. And our old friend the Horned Beast.
Probably because I haven't finished, Captain Yates.
Ever since man began? Exactly. But why? All right, Captain Yates, the curtains. Now creatures like those have been seen over and over again throughout the history of man, and man has turned them into myths, gods or devils, but they're neither. They are, in fact, creatures from another world.
Precisely, only far, far older and immeasurably more dangerous.
That's right. They're Daemons from the planet Daemos, which is?
And they first came to Earth nearly one hundred thousand years ago.
That's right. Mind you, when it landed it was two hundred feet long and thirty feet across. But they diminished it, just as they diminished themselves, which accounts for the heat wave and the freeze-up.
Oh, come on, Jo. E=MC squared.
Look, when you lose mass the energy has to go somewhere.
Exactly.
To help Homo sapiens kick out Neanderthal man. They've been coming and going ever since. The Greek civilisation, the Renaissance, the industrial revolution. They were all inspired by the Daemons.
Look, don't you see? All the magical traditions are just remnants of their advanced science, and that is what the Master is using.
Amoral, perhaps. They help Earth but on their own terms. It's a scientific experiment to them. Just another laboratory rat.
He's established a link with the Daemon. What worries me is the choice. Domination by the Master or total annihilation.
What does any scientist do with an experiment that fails? He chucks it in the rubbish bin.
Now the Daemon will appear three times, and the third time he'll probably tell us what our fate is to be. Now he'll be in the cavern somewhere awaiting the Master's second call.
You'd be wasting your time, Sergeant. At the moment he's so small he's practically invisible.
Jo, would you get me a piece of paper and a pencil, please?
What? Give me that. You'll do no such thing, Lethbridge Stewart. Of all the idiotic suggestions. In the first place, the energy released would only strengthen the barrier, in the second place it would provoke the most appalling reprisals and in the third place I've got a better idea. Over.
Have you got the mobile HQ there?
With the new mark 4A condenser unit?
Good. Then I've got your problem solved and mine. We're going to build a diothermic energy exchanger. Is your technical fellow there?
Right, well tell him to build an EHF wide band width variable phase oscillator, with a negative feedback circuit tunable to the frequency of an air molecule at, er, what is the temperature up at the barrier, Brigadier?
Well, it's a simple enough question. Over.
All right, I'll come out and explain it to you myself. Yates and Benton can stay here and keep an eye open. Only don't touch anything until I get there. Understood?
I'll be with you in ten minutes.
Jo, the Brigadier is doing his best to cope with an almost impossible situation. And since he is your superior officer, you might at least show him a little respect. Coming?
What's happening? I told Yates and Benton to stay in the pub.
Who's flying that thing? That's not Benton!
Hang on, Jo. We're in for a bumpy ride.
Like a man possessed, you mean. Look out, he's coming back.
No, you keep away. It's me he's after, not you.
He's trying to drive us into the heat barrier.
Hang tight, Jo. Hang on tight. Now!
She's had a nasty knock on the head. She'll be all right. You'd better load her into Bessie and take her down to the pub. She'll be needing rest and quiet for a bit.
Well, I'd better go and have a word with the Brigadier. He's probably bursting a blood vessel by now.
You've got the mind of an accountant, Lethbridge Stewart. So, this is your heat barrier, is it?
Yes?
Hmm. Even rock.
A hasty and inaccurate assessment, Brigadier. Tell me, have you got enough cable to reach those high tension pylons over there.
We'll need at least ten thousand volts to get through this lot.
Good. Only please hurry, we may have very little time left.
Negative diathermy, Sergeant. Buffer the molecular movement of the air with the reverse phase short waves. It's quite simple.
Yes, well, according to classical aerodynamics, it's impossible for a bumblebee to fly!
Now get a move on with the heat exchanger. We've got to get it charged and through this barrier and down to the village before it's too late.
No, man, no. You're trying to channel the entire output of the National Power Complex through one transistor. Reverse it.
Reverse the polarity.
Yes, I couldn't agree with you more, Sergeant. Now let's concentrate, shall we?
About next Christmas, I shouldn't wonder. At a rough estimate, of course.
My dear chap, I can't wait to find out.
It's going. I must get back. The next time could be the finish. Sergeant Osgood, can you operate that machine now?
Yes, well, you'll have to. We may have very little time left.
Well, of course they won't. That's the whole point.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. All right, I'll explain once again. Only this time, please listen.
And it comes out here. Right?
Good grief, man, it's as simple as Einstein's Special theory of Relativity.
Good. And when you get that thing finished, bring it through the barrier and down to the village at once, all right?
Yes, yes, most amusing.
Now please, let me pass. Frankly, any time I'd gladly join you but I
What on Earth is going on? What are you doing? What on Earth is this?
The Master's planning to make slaves of you all. I'm the only one who has a chance of stopping him.
That's nonsense. All the Master will bring upon you is disaster!
Are you out of your mind?
You choose to mock the great Qui Quae Quod? Well, I will not.
What had you mind?
Shatter it. Yes. Lamp, I order you to shatter!
You see? That could have been you. Now, all of you look at the, er, weathercock on the church tower?
Weathercock, now!
There, that'll teach you. Daughter of light, would you kindly untie my bonds?
I'll give you one more chance. Look behind you.
Very well. Let my familiar spirit bring that car to me!
I'm sorry to disappoint you, madame, but I were, I'd hardly need your assistance in extricating me from this, this sacrificial gift wrapping.
Elemental, my dear Benton.
Where else?
Wait, all of you.
Well, of course I'm frightened. So should you be, and your friend Mister Magister.
Now we're facing the greatest danger the world has ever known. Now, look, I've got to tell you the truth.
(sotto) I've got to risk it.
I'm not a magician or a wizard or anything of the sort.
But neither is the Master. I've tricked you, yes, but only to save you from him.
Yes, of course, that too.
Science, not sorcery, Miss Hawthorne. Look.
And your Mister Magister uses no more magic than that.
All his feats are based on science. Either ours or the secret science of the Daemons.
Well, he uses violent emotions. Fear, hatred, greed.
Well, the emotions of a group of ordinary human beings generate a tremendous charge of psychokinetic energy. This the Master channels for his own purpose.
No, Miss Hawthorne, I'm afraid not.
No, no, no, of course not. No, they are essential to generate and control the psionic forces, and to control the Daemon himself.
How?
Yes?
Exactly. All we can do is wait.
The energy exchanger. This machine that the Brigadier is building for me. With that I should be able to drain off our visitor's energy. Then perhaps we can sort him out.
Jo? I thought she was still in the pub?
What?
Walkie talkie. Hello, Brigadier? Are you there?
Look, they've got Jo. That machine must come through now. Now, do you understand?!
Now!
Good. And put a watch up on that barrow, will you? Just in case the Daemon's ship reactivates.
Come on, Brigadier. Get a move on.
Right, now some of you that way, but spread out. The rest of you, follow me.
No. We must wait for the Brigadier.
We won't help her by committing suicide.
You see? What's going on, Brigadier?
You must hurry!
You'll have to use the booster.
Look, what's going on, Brigadier?
What, all of you?
Well, that should have come through first.
The exchanger is working. It's bleeding off the energy.
And about time, too. Now get it over here fast!
Brigadier? Brigadier, are you all right?
A fat lot of good that'll do. Right, keep the others back, Captain Yates, I'm going in before that creature recovers.
Alone!
Hello, Jo. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you.
Oh, I'm a dead man. I knew that as soon as I came through that door, so you'd better watch out. You see, I've nothing to lose, have I?
I came to talk to you.
Certainly. But first let her go.
Are you all right, Jo?
Yes. I want you to leave this planet while you still can.
Why not? I've got a machine outside that can annihilate you.
You've already felt its power.
One of them, yes. Not both.
To try and make you listen to me.
If you kill me now, you will wonder throughout eternity whether you should have listened to my words.
I seem to remember somebody else speaking like that. What was the bounder's name? Hitler. Yes, that's right, Adolf Hitler. Or was it Genghis Khan?
I'm very pleased to hear it.
By no means. You see, I have an alternative.
Leave humanity alone. Just go. You've done enough harm.
You certainly did. Thanks to you man can now blow up the world and he probably will. He can poison the water and the very air he breathes. He's already started. He can
No! No, I don't want it!
Of course I do! Don't you understand? I want you to leave. I want you to go away and give man a chance to grow up.
Run for it, Brigadier!
Well, by a ridiculous and foolhardy act of self-sacrifice, Jo here has managed to save us.
You did. You see, Azal couldn't face an act as irrational and as illogical as her being prepared to give up her life for me. Look, Jo, why don't you go and get out of that ridiculous garb?
Well, all his power was turned against himself. You might say he blew a fuse.
The spaceship. Automatic self-destruct, I suppose.
Stop firing. You'll damage Bessie.
Don't worry, Bessie'll bring him back.
Simple, if you know how.
And look after him. I want to deal with him later.
Thank you for the compliment.
To what?
Yes, well, it makes a change from the smell of sulphur, doesn't it?
(dancing) You're right, Jo, there is magic in the world after all.

It won't open.
Get inside the house. Just try and close off the doors and windows.
Donna, you coming?
Ross, look after yourself. Get inside the building.
It's not so bad for me. Go on, get inside the Tardis. Oh, I've never given you a key. Keep that. Go on, that's yours. Quite a big moment really.
Good idea.
To stop a war.
Right then, here I am. Good. Whatever you do, Colonel Mace, do not engage the Sontarans in battle. There is nothing they like better than a war. Just leave this to me.
I've got the Tardis. I'm going to get on board their ship.
(to Martha) Come on.
Taste that, in the air. Yuck. That sort of metal tang. Teleport exchange. It's the Sontarans. They've taken it. I'm stuck on Earth like, like an ordinary person. Like a human. How rubbish is that? Sorry, no offence, but come on.
Well, I mean, it's shielded. They could never detect it.
I'm just wondering, have you phoned your family and Tom?
The gas. Tell them to stay inside.
Oh, she's gone home. She's not like you. She's not a soldier. Right. So. Avanti.
Change of plan.
I'm not fighting. I'm not-fighting, as in not hyphen fighting, got it? Now, does anyone know what this gas is yet?
And who are you?
Oh, put your hand down. Don't salute.
The Sontaran ship.
You can't do that. Nuclear missiles won't even scratch the surface. Let me talk to the Sontarans.
I've got that authority. I earned that a long time ago.
Calling the Sontaran Command Ship
Under Jurisdiction Two of the Intergalactic Rules of Engagement.
This is the Doctor.
Yeah, loving the diplomacy, thanks. So, tell me, General Staal, since when did you lot become cowards?
Yeah, I'm really glad you didn't say belittle, because then I'd have a field day. But poison gas? That's the weapon of a coward and you know it.
Staal, you could blast this planet out of the sky
And yet you're sitting up above watching it die. Where's the fight in that? Where's the honour? Or
Are you lot planning something else, because this isn't normal Sontaran warfare. What are you lot up to?
Ah, the war's not going so well, then. Losing, are we?
The war between the Sontarans and the Rutans. It's been raging, far out in the stars, for fifty thousand years. Fifty thousand years of bloodshed, and for what?
Give me a break.
Finished?
Well, as prizes go, that's noble.
As they say in Latin, Donna nobis pacem.
Did you never wonder about its design? It's a phone box. It contains a phone. A telephonic device for communication. Sort of symbolic. Like, if only we could communicate, you and I.
Big mistake though, showing it to me.
DOCTOR Because I've got remote control.
Ah, well.
Oh, you'd be surprised.
It must be something the Sontarans invented. This isn't just poison. They need this gas for something else. What could that be?
What? I told you not to launch.
You're making a mistake, Colonel. For once, I hope the Sontarans are ahead of you.
Missiles wouldn't even dent that ship, so why are the Sontarans so keen to stop you? Any ideas?
Get them out of there.
He wasn't Greyhound Forty. His name was Ross. Now listen to me, and get them out of there!
Why? They don't need it. Why attack now? What are they up to? Times like this, I could do with the Brigadier. No offence.
Because they wanted UNIT here. You gave them something they needed. Something now hidden inside the factory. Something precious.
It's the bullets. It causes expansion of the copper shell.
For the billionth time, you can't fight Sontarans.
(sotto) Phone. Have you got a phone? I need your mobile. Quickly, hurry up.
Still on Earth. But don't worry, I've got my secret weapon.
You.
Yeah, I haven't got a remote, though I really should. I need you on that ship. That's why I made them move
The Tardis. I'm sorry
But you've got to go outside.
Sontarans. But they'll all be on battle stations right now. They don't exactly walk about
Having coffee. I can talk you through it.
I know, and I wouldn't ask, but there's nothing else I can do. The whole planet is choking, Donna.
The Sontarans are inside the factory which means they've got a teleport link with the ship, but they'll have deadlocked it. I need you to
Reopen the link.
Donna, stop talking about yourself like that. You can do this.
I promise.
Did he see you?
Right, Donna, listen. On the back of his neck
On his collar there's a sort of plug, like a hole. The Probic vent.
One blow to the Probic vent knocks 'them out.
I'm sorry. I swear I'm so sorry, but you've got to try.
Now then, you got to find the external junction feed to the teleport.
A circular panel on the wall.
Big symbol on the front, like a, like a
Letter T with a horizontal line through it. Or, or, two Fs back to back.
Should be a switch by the side.
You've got three fingers.
Oh, you are brilliant, you are.
Got to go. Keep the line open.
I said, you don't stand a chance.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Are you my mummy?
But the Sontarans have got lasers. You can't even see in this fog. The night vision doesn't work.
It's the Valiant.
Whoa, that's brilliant.
No, not at all. Not me.
DOCTOR Donna, hold on. I'm coming.
Nah, you and me, Martha Jones. Just like old times.
Alien technology, this-a way.
No Sontarans down here. They can't resist a battle. Here we go.
Oh, Martha, I'm so sorry. Still alive.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Not at all.
Doing exactly what I wanted. I needed to stop the missiles, just as much as the Sontarans. I'm not having Earth start an interstellar war. You're a triple agent.
About you? Oh, right from the start. Reduced iris contraction, slight thinning of the hair follicles on the left temple. And, frankly, you smell. You might as well have worn a T shirt saying clone. Although, maybe not in front of Captain Jack. You remember him, don't you? Because you've got all her memories. That's why the Sontarans had to protect her, to keep you inside UNIT. Martha Jones is keeping you alive.
It's all right, it's all right, I'm here, I'm here. I've got you, I've got you.
Oh! Blimey, I'm busy. Got it?
Take off the covering. All the blue switches inside
Flick them up like a fuse box, and that should get the teleport working.
The gas. Tell us about the gas.
Clonefeed. It's clonefeed!
Like amniotic fluid for Sontarans. That's why they're not invading. They're converting the atmosphere, changing the planet into a clone world. Earth becomes a great big hatchery. Because the Sontarans are clones, that's how they reproduce. Give them a planet this big, they'll create billions of new soldiers. The gas isn't poison, it's food.
Now!
Hold on, hold on. Get off me, get off me. Got to bring the Tardis down.
Right, now. Martha, you coming?
Just keep pressing N. We want to keep those missiles on the ground.
Yeah, long story. Here we go. The old team, back together. Well, the new team.
No, no, no. No. I needed to get the teleport working so that we could get to
Here. The Rattigan Academy, owned by
If I see one more gun
That's why the Sontarans had to stop the missiles. They were holding back. Because caesofine gas is volatile, that's why they had to use you to stop the nuclear attack. Ground to air engagement could spark off the whole thing.
Yeah. They need all the gas intact to breed their clone army. And all the time we had Luke here in his dream factory. Planning a little trip, were we?
You were building equipment, ready to terraform El Mondo Luko so that humans could live there and breathe the air with this. An atmospheric converter.
If I can get this on the right setting.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
Now we're in trouble.
Right. So, Donna, thank you for everything. Martha, you too. Oh, so many times. Luke, do something clever with your life.
Sontarans are never defeated. They'll be getting ready for war. And, well, you know, I've recalibrated this for Sontaran air, so
I can't.
I've got to give them a choice.
General Staal, you know what this is. But there's one more option. You can go. Just leave. Sontaran High Command need never know what happened here.
I'll do it, Staal. If it saves the Earth, I'll do it.
I am giving you the chance to leave.
I'm warning you.
Shoot me, I'm still going to press this. You'll die, Staal.
I'll do it.
What? What?
No, no, no. I didn't touch anything. We're in flight. It's not me.
I don't know. It's out of control!

Oh, let's take the fun and mystery out of everything. Martha, you don't want to know. It just does. Hold on tight.
Yes, and I failed it. Now, make the most of it. I promised you one trip, and one trip only. Outside this door, brave new world.
Take a look. After you.
Mind out.
Somewhere before the invention of the toilet. Sorry about that.
Of course we can. Why do you ask?
Tell you what then, don't step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?
Are you planning to?
Well, then.
I think so. Round about 1599.
Why would they do that?
I'm not even human. Just walk about like you own the place. Works for me. Besides, you'd be surprised. Elizabethan England, not so different from your time. Look over there. They've got recycling.
Water cooler moment.
Global warming. Oh, yes, and entertainment. Popular entertainment for the masses. If I'm right, we're just down the river by Southwark, right next to
Oh, yes, the Globe Theatre! Brand new. Just opened. Through, strictly speaking, it's not a globe, it's a tetradecagon. Fourteen sides. Containing the man himself.
Oh, yes. Miss Jones, will you accompany me to the theatre?
When you get home, you can tell everyone you've seen Shakespeare.
London never changes.
Well, they do now.
Genius. He's a genius. The genius. The most human human there's ever been. Now we're going to hear him speak. Always he chooses the best words. New, beautiful, brilliant words.
Oh, well.
Exactly. The lost play. It doesn't exist, only in rumours. It's mentioned in lists of his plays but never ever turns up. And no one knows why.
No.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I was just going to give you a quick little trip in the Tardis, but I suppose we could stay a bit longer.
Hello! Excuse me, not interrupting, am I? Mister Shakespeare, isn't it?
No, no, don't do that. Don't.
I'm Sir Doctor of Tardis and this is my companion, Miss Martha Jones.
Oh, that's very clever. That proves it. Absolute genius.
Psychic paper. Er, long story. Oh, I hate starting from scratch.
It's political correctness gone mad. Er, Martha's from a far-off land. Freedonia.
What's wrong with him? Leave it to me. I'm a doctor.
I've never seen a death like it. His lungs are full of water. He drowned and then, I don't know, like a blow to the heart, an invisible blow.
Good mistress, this poor fellow has died from a sudden imbalance of the humours. A natural if unfortunate demise. Call a constable and have him taken away.
This lot still have got one foot in the Dark Ages. If I tell them the truth, they'll panic and think it was witchcraft.
Witchcraft.
I do a lot of reading.
All the world's a stage.
Nighty night, Shakespeare.
Oh, it'll do. I've seen worse.
Oh. Er.
Contains Venusian spearmint.
We'll manage. Come on.
Wait till you read book seven. (published 2007) Oh, I cried.
Course it isn't!
Looks like witchcraft, but it isn't. Can't be. Are you going to stand there all night?
There's such a thing as psychic energy, but a human couldn't channel it like that. Not without a generator the size of Taunton and I think we'd have spotted that. No, there's something I'm missing, Martha. Something really close, staring me right in the face and I can't see it. Rose'd know. A friend of mine, Rose. Right now, she'd say exactly the right thing. Still, can't be helped. You're a novice, never mind. I'll take you back home tomorrow.
Her heart gave out. She died of fright.
What did you see?
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
You can't. It's someone else's.
Not, not quite yet.
The architect. Hold on. The architect! The architect! The Globe! Come on!
The columns there, right? Fourteen sides. I've always wondered, but I never asked. Tell me, Will. Why fourteen sides?
Fourteen. Why does that ring a bell? Fourteen.
So there is. Good point. Words and shapes following the same design. Fourteen lines, fourteen sides, fourteen facets. Oh, my head. Tetradecagon. Think, think, think! Words, letters, numbers, lines!
Oh yeah, but a theatre's magic, isn't it? You should know. Stand on this stage, say the right words with the right emphasis a the right time. Oh, you can make men weep, or cry with joy. Change them. You can change people's minds just with words in this place. But if you exaggerate that.
Oh. Oh, Martha Jones, I like you. Tell you what, though. Peter Streete would know. Can I talk to him?
Where is he now?
We're going to go there. Right now. Come on.
Come on. We can all have a good flirt later.
Oh, fifty seven academics just punched the air. Now move!
No, I don't!
You lost your son.
You should write that down.
I think it helps if you don't whip them. Now get out!
Peter? Peter Streete?
Peter?
Peter, I'm the Doctor. Go into the past. One year ago. Let your mind go back. Back to when everything was fine and shining. Everything that happened in this year since happened to somebody else. It was just a story. A Winter's Tale. Let go. That's it. That's it, just let go.
Tell me the story, Peter. Tell me about the witches.
Where did Peter see the witches? Where in the city? Peter, tell me. You've got to tell me where were they?
No!
That's not going to work. The whole building's shouting that.
Well, if you're looking for volunteers.
Oh, but there's a power in words. If I can find the right one. If I can just know you.
: Then it's a good thing I'm here. Now think, think, think. Humanoid female, uses shapes and words to channel energy. Ah! Fourteen! That's it! Fourteen!
The fourteen stars of the Rexel planetary configuration!
Creature, I name you Carrionite!
I named her. The power of a name. That's old magic.
Well, it's just a different sort of science. You lot, you chose mathematics. Given the right string of numbers, the right equation, you can split the atom. Carrionites use words instead.
The end of the world.
The Carrionites disappeared way back at the dawn of the universe. Nobody was sure if they were real or legend.
A new empire on Earth. A world of bones and blood and witchcraft.
I'm looking at the man with the words.
What happens on the last page?
That's it. They used you. They gave you the final words like a spell, like a code. Love's Labours Won. It's a weapon. The right combination of words, spoken at the right place, with the shape of the Globe as an energy converter! The play's the thing! (Hamlet) And yes, you can have that.
All Hallows Street. There it is. Martha, we'll track them down. Will, you get to the Globe. Whatever you do, stop that play.
Good luck, Shakespeare. Once more unto the breach.
(pokes his head around door) Oh, just shift!
All Hallows Street, but which house?
Oh, how to explain the mechanics of the infinite temporal flux? I know. Back to the Future. It's like Back to the Future.
No, the novelisation. Yes, the film. Marty McFly goes back and changes history.
You and the entire future of the human race. It ends right now in 1599 if we don't stop it. But which house?
Ah. Make that witch house.
I take it we're expected.
What have you done?
The naming won't work on me.
Oh, big mistake. Because that name keeps me fighting. The Carrionites vanished. Where did you go?
And how did you escape?
Shakespeare.
How many of you?
Hmm. Busy schedule. But first you've got to get past me.
Now, that's one form of magic that's definitely not going to work on me.
What did you do?
Well, give it back.
Well, that's just cheating.
Now, you might call that magic. I'd call that a DNA replication module.
You're making a habit of this. Ah! I've only got one heart working. How do you people cope? I've got to get the other one started. Hit me! Hit me on the chest! Dah! Other side. Now, on the back, on the back. Left a bit. Dah, lovely. There we go. Badda booma! Well, what are you standing there for? Come one! The Globe!
No, we're not! We're going the wrong way!
Stage door!
Stop the play. I think that was it. Yeah, I said, stop the play!
Yeah, don't rub it, you'll go bald. I think that's my cue!
Come on, Will! History needs you!
Reverse it!
The shape of the Globe gives words power, but you're the wordsmith, the one true genius. The only man clever enough to do it.
You're William Shakespeare!
Trust yourself. When you're locked away in your room, the words just come, don't they, like magic. Words of the right sound, the right shape, the right rhythm. Words that last forever. That's what you do, Will. You choose perfect words. Do it. Improvise.
Seven six one three nine oh!
Expelliarmus!
Good old JK!
Love's Labours Won. There it goes.
Good props store back there. I'm not sure about this though. Reminds me of a Sycorax.
I should be on ten percent. How's your head?
Here, I got you this.
Neck brace. Wear that for a few days till it's better, although you might want to keep it. It suits you.
Gone. I looked all over. Every single copy of Love's Labours Won went up in the sky.
Yeah, better not, Will. There's still power in those words. Maybe it should best stay forgotten.
Anyway, time we were off. I've got a nice attic in the Tardis where this lot can scream for all eternity, and I've got to take Martha back to Freedonia.
You what?
That's incredible. You are incredible.
Queen Elizabeth the First!
What?
What?
What?
How should I know? Haven't even met her yet. That's time travel for you. Still, can't wait to find out.
That's something to look forward to. Ooo!

Iceworld. A space trading colony on the dark side of the planet Svartos. Space travellers stop there for supplies. I've been picking up a faint tracking signal for some time. I think there's something interesting going on there, Mel.
Oh, trust not appearances, Mel. You never know what might be lurking in the freezer chests. Think gothic.
This way.
Ah, two of your best strawberry milkshakes, if you please.
Glitz!
I've regenerated. The difference is purely perceptual.
What's this, Glitz? Not another one of your dodgy deals backfired?
You mean
Er, steady on there, Mel.
Glitz.
I think you'd better pay back the money, Glitz.
Why not?
You've only got yourself to blame.
Oh really, Mel, it's fascinating. Travellers claim to have seen it throughout the centuries but there's never been any proof.
Loch.
Absolutely.
Won't you get into trouble with your boss?
Well, I don't see why not.
Treasure?
Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.
It shows the lower levels of Iceworld.
The Ice Garden, the Singing Trees.
Where's your sense of adventure, Glitz?
Where?
My sentiments precisely. What's your name, incidentally?
Oh, how do you do. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Mel.
Nonsense, Glitz. Time for a quick adventure then back for tea.
And I was so looking forward to meeting a dragon.
Have you seen any Singing Trees or Ice Gardens, Glitz?
Well, since we've come from that direction, I think we should go in that direction. Then again
Perhaps that direction. Yes. And keep your eyes peeled for any Singing Trees or Ice Gardens, Glitz.
Singing Trees.
Use your imagination, Glitz. Willow trees, something like that.
Air current causes the crystal membranes to vibrate.
Yes, what's it do?
Yes. Some sort of opto-electronic circuit. But why? I mean, what's it doing here?
Possibly. Come on, Glitz. Tempus fugit. I want to be back in time for tea.
Glitz? Glitz? Glitz?
Glitz, I sympathise with your disappointment, but I'm about to plummet to my death.
Glitz!
Glitz!
I say, thank you.
Why don't you explain the problem to him?
Ah.
These types never have any sense of fair play.
Ah, hang on there a minute, Glitz. I'm engaged in a project of scientific curiosity. I mean, that dragon, or whatever it may turn out to be, could be an undiscovered species.
You have me there, Glitz. Without the map, I'll never find the creature.
All right, then. Where's the Nosferatu berthed?
I'll do my best.
Excuse me. What's your attitude towards the nature of existence? For example, do you hold any strong theological opinions?
I see. That's a very interesting concept.
Well, how do you reconcile that with the empirical critical belief that experience is at the root of all phenomena?
So, what you're saying is that before Plato existed, someone had to have the idea of Plato.
Yes.
Hello. Not interrupting anything, am I?
That's a very difficult question. Why is everyone round here so preoccupied with metaphysics?
Ah. An existentialist.
Oh, I think he does. I think he bought you like he buys everything in Iceworld.
I think he bought you a long time ago. He paid seventeen crowns for each of Glitz's crew. How much did he pay for you? Was it worth it? Were you worth it?
No, Glitz. You can't go on stealing everything you want, like this Stradivarius and that Dutch master. Pay Kane back his debt, even if it costs a thousand crowns, ten thousand crowns. Pay back the debt. And as for you, your debt to Kane, I don't think you'll be able to pay it off. Ever.
I think we go straight on. (distant roar) Either that, or we don't.
Well, I'm not absolutely certain this one's over yet.
It must be generating a spot temperature in excess of fifteen hundred Celsius.
No, Glitz, don't.
We've got no right to kill.
Perhaps we'd better ask it.
Ah, Mel, you've brought my umbrella.
Now, now, stop this squabbling. There's no place for animosity on a serious scientific undertaking.
Well, it's not so much a dragon as more of a semi-organic vertebrate with a highly developed cerebral cortex.
Really? Well, I wonder what you did to annoy it?
Really. Well, let's see what this vertebrate with laser beams has got to say for itself.
Hello. Where might you have popped up from, then?
Cryogenesis, eh?
It's no good, Glitz. Ace says he's been cryogenically frozen.
It's no use. Deep cryogenics freezes the neural pathways.
It's completely impossible for him to recall any events prior to cryogenesis.
Except in cases of overwhelming hatred or anger.
We don't mean you any harm. Do you understand?
Well, let's see what our new friend wants to show us, shall we?
I think he wants us to watch.
Ah, so that's what this is all about, a polydimensional scanning imager. And I bet the creature's using itself as the energy source.
Fascinating.
Oh, no, no. We might be deep beneath Iceworld, but Kane could find his way here easily enough. No, the treasure's got to be somewhere else, somewhere beyond Kane's reach. What does he fear most?
Precisely. And what better way of protecting the real treasure than to leave a fire-breathing dragon to guard it? What better protection than if the dragon is the treasure.
Am I right? Are you the one that everyone's looking for, treasure?
No, look past the gold and the gemstone, Glitz. Look at the fire inside. A source of intense optical energy.
Look at it through Kane's eyes. See it as an evil mind would see it.
There's something not right. Can't put my finger. Proamon. Proamon.
Yes, but where have I heard of it before? I mean, where was it? Was it in the past or is it in the future?
Is a grain of sand important, Glitz? I must go back and consult my star charts on the Tardis.
A primitive star chart. Missing constellations, orbital calculations, I imagine. Ah yes, I would like to see this.
Er, you stay here. I shan't be long.
Now, now, now, now, now. You stay here with them. They can look after you so you don't get into any trouble, Glitz.
Don't argue! The three of you are safer together.
They always mark north and south on these things, never backwards and forwards.
Tell you what, you seem to know where you're going. Why don't I just trust to your sense of direction?
Silver bells and cockle shells, and ice gardens all in a row. Extraordinary. This must be a solar system. There's a large red star with small orbiting planets. Constellations, yes, but that one's too high up. They're all slightly out of position. This star chart's no use any more. How long have you been on this planet? Two thousand years? Longer?
Oh, you want to be leaving.
Where's Glitz?
We've got to hurry. We might be able to stop Kane and save the creature.
Back to the Tardis.
The creature will always be under threat from Kane, unless we can convince him that his star charts are hopelessly wrong. Then we might be able to put an end to all this.
Where is everyone? Must be half day closing. I don't think we've got much time.
That's it, Proamon.
There is no planet Proamon.
Quiet! There are things to be done.
Come on.
Later, Ace. We're in a hurry.
Come on, Mel. We're wasting valuable time.
Yes, and it had a final surprise for anyone who wanted to try and interfere with it. A huge energy surge when its head was disconnected.
We'll finish its job for it, and put an end to all this death and destruction.
This is not good enough.
No doubt.
We've no choice. The creature's already dead. Ace is still alive.
Three thousand years, eh? Long enough for an entire civilisation to have come and gone.
You know, for someone who's had the patience to wait around for three thousand years, you seem to be in rather a hurry suddenly.
Three thousand years since you were exiled here from Proamon, along with the creature.
Just a traveller.
No, no, no, you should keep them for souvenir value, along with the Ice Garden.
And without it you are powerless.
And the living creature was created to keep you prisoner.
Look, let me explain.
The logic is inescapable.
It sounds like a starflight drive.
Vengeance on whom, Kane? You're too late.
But where will you find another home planet?
Was your home planet. Take a look at your navigational equipment. It's fully operative now.
Sadly not. Your planet, your people, your entire race were destroyed one thousand years after you were exiled.
Look at the sun of Proamon. When you left, it was a cold red giant surrounded by freezing planets.
Your sun turned supernova two thousand years ago, and all its planets were engulfed in the explosion. Your people were annihilated, your planet obliterated. You're too late, Kane, for your revenge. You have no home. Time has flowed by.
Time? Funny old business, time. It delights in frustrating your plans. All Kane's perfidious aims thwarted by a quirk of time.
Oh.
Yes, well, you could be right. Time for you to go.
Well, it is time.
You must go.
There's no point, Mel. No point hanging around wasting time.
There's no time, Mel.
I do. I usually do.
That's right, yes, you're going. Been gone for ages. Already gone, still here, just arrived, haven't even met you yet. It all depends on who you are and how you look at it. Strange business, time.
I'm sorry, Mel. Think about me when you're living your life one day after another, all in a neat pattern. Think about the homeless traveller and his old police box, with his days like crazy paving.
Excellent. Yes, Mel can keep you out of trouble, Glitz.
Glitz.
Nonsense. An idyllic place, Perivale. It's got lush green fields and a village blacksmith, and
Oh.
But I don't have an address.
Ace, where do you think you're going?
Ah yes, but by which route? The direct route with Glitz, or the scenic route? Well? Do you fancy a quick trip round the twelve galaxies and then back to Perivale in time for tea?
But there are three rules. One, I'm in charge.
Two, I'm not the Professor, I'm the Doctor.
And the third. Well, I'll think up the third by the time we get back to Perivale.

It's strange how in some galaxies these tollports spring up all over the place like mushrooms, yet in others you can go for light years without seeing a single one.
I think it relates to the way that space is being developed. I mean, there never has been a consistent three dimensional planning policy.
And by completely ignoring the overspill from the fourth dimension they sometimes build one port right on top of the other, only realising it when there's an interface slippage.
Yes, it is serious. I don't seem to have any change. Er, take five credits from the kitty, Mel.
That kitty defies all known laws of physics. I keep filling it up and it's always empty. Mel, there's something wrong. Only their landing lights are on.
Mel, I don't like the look of this one little bit.
Get ready to run back into the Tardis at the first sign of trouble.
Who's there?
It's a funny way to welcome your friends. We thought you'd been attacked by space pirates. Now, about this toll fee
Ten billion customers?
You mean to say ten billion people have come here?
Congratulations. Now, about this toll fee.
A holiday? Yes, a week's holiday would be quite pleasant. A green swarth, a babbling brook, birds twittering.
Just what's required. A large dose of tranquillity.
Navarinos from the tribe on Navarro? Squat, wrinkly, purply creatures? Won't they be a little conspicuous on Earth?
Who's that?
Oh, this is going to be very interesting.
Nostalgia Trips, the most notorious travel firm in the five galaxies. It was a Nostalgia Trip cruiser that got stuck with the glass eaters of Tharl.
Mel, you go ahead on the bus. I'll follow on in the Tardis.
Well, I simply applied the Tardis vortex drive to generate an antigravity spiral to halt your descent. Sorry about the bumpy landing. A miscalculation.
The satellite seems to have jammed your navigational pod. Ah, hello, Mel. Nice trip?
No, well, according to my reckoning, it seems to be somewhere in, er, Wales.
Maybe that series of primitive dwellings could be used as some sort of way station.
Excellent. Just what we're looking for.
Oh, don't go by appearances, Mel. Often the most interesting people stay at these places. This is the real Fifties.
I'm the Doctor.
Ah, this is the cause of the problem. An extremely crude low orbital satellite capable only of the most rudimentary of radio transmissions.
Well, you see that navi-pod? It needs to be unbolted so we can replace the broken crystal.
Now, inside this box is the only Quarb crystal this side of Softel nebula.
Ah, well done. Now, carefully does it.
Do you always carry around a full set of tools with you?
A stitch in time fills up space.
Well, if you think it might help, I could transport everyone in the Tardis.
Hmm. Well, there is another alternative. I could accelerate growth in the thermo-booster and create a crystal in about er, twenty four hours.
Yes. A most personable young lady. Practical, too. She seems very fond of you, Billy.
Well, it is home, for the moment. At least until the navi-pod's fixed. Personally speaking, I rather like it.
Excellent.
About your room mate.
Have you managed to speak to her at all?
If she's who I think she is, then she's in danger.
That's what we've got to find out.
Try to get her to come to the dance. It might relax her, and then maybe she'll speak with us later on.
How appropriate.
I said, for a primitive piece of technology it certainly delivers the decibels.
Bad? No. Rather nice, in fact.
Er, have you known each other long?
Come on, let's go down to the front.
I was wondering, Ray, if
Great dance.
Ah, you Navarinos have a notoriously high metabolic rate.
Excuse me, Murray.
There, there. There's many a slap twixt a cup and a lap, Ray.
If you kill for money, let the girl go. She's worth nothing to you.
Do you feel all right? Nothing hurt or broken?
I'm afraid he was paid in kind. You see this signal beacon? It exploded from the inside. Obviously the Bannermen locked into his signal and fired off a high impulse beam right along his transmission track.
I'm afraid so. Ionised.
Yes. A poignant reminder that violence always rebounds on itself. But we must warn the others that an attack is imminent.
Mel, Mel, are you all right?
Well, I'm afraid that'll have to wait. Do you know where Delta and Billy have gone?
Well, we've got to find them as quick as we can. And organise an evacuation of the camp. The Bannermen are on their way.
Good. But they'll be one short.
Yes. But I must try and find Delta and Billy. Do you know where they might be, Ray?
Well, we're going to have to keep looking for them until we find them. But first we must convince Burton to evacuate the camp. Mel, you find Murray. Ray, come with me.
An excellent summary, Mister Burton. Now, if you start right away, then we'll be able to get them to safety.
I thought you might be a little skeptical. What can I do to convince you?
Listen, Mister Burton. If you don't act right away, innocent people will die! I will do whatever I can to convince you I'm not suffering from some sort of delusion.
Of course, but let's go quickly.
It's called a Tardis, an acronym for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space.
Yes, with pleasure, but first things first. We must clear the camp.
I see you've got everything under control, Murray. We must go and see the crystal. If it's ready, then you must leave.
It's almost re-grown. Just another half hour. And then you've got to leave, whether I come back or not.
I've got to find Delta. Mel, you stay here and organise things. Come on, let's go, Ray.
Take care of the crystal!
Did you come here with Billy often?
Could it be hidden?
Well, they're not here. Come on.
Excuse me! Have you seen a couple go by? A fellow on a big black bike and a lady with a green polka dot dress.
Are there any other places, Ray?
Well, let's give it a try.
Ah, these tyre marks show a heavy motorcycle and sidecar. Come on.
Found you at last.
Yes. We overheard a space mercenary give the position of the camp. There's a price on your head.
Murray's fixing the bus. He shouldn't be long. Then you can leave. So we've got to go back now.
Stop, stop. Stop! Stop! He's not following us.
My immediate objectives are to set them free and find Delta and the baby somewhere safe.
Shush. Those marks behind her ear are high frequency antennae. What are you picking up?
Does he keep bees?
Quick.
I wonder if you could help us.
Oh, and I'm the Doctor.
Is it possible for these people to stay with you for a few hours?
I'm going to have to leave at once. I wonder if you could lend me a pillowcase and a broom handle.
Splendid. Oh, Billy, may I borrow your bike?
I'll treat it as if it were the Tardis.
How dare you! The white flag is the accepted signal for truce throughout the civilised universe! You may think that might is right, but I can assure you, you won't get away with it.
Your charm is only matched by your compassion.
Because you're in enough trouble already, Gavrok. Release those prisoners and I will testify that you showed some mercy.
We agree to differ. But you should know that Delta has sworn a statement alleging invasion and genocide of the Chimerons. You will be brought to account, Gavrok, and made to pay for your actions.
Life? What do you know about life, Gavrok? You deal in death. Lies, treachery and murder are your currency. You promise life, but in the end it will be life which defeats you.
As you will. I came here under a white flag and I will leave under that same white flag, and woe betide any man who breaches its integrity. Now step aside! Release those prisoners.
Gavrok, it's over. You're finished, and we're leaving.
Actually, I think I may have gone a little too far.
Yes, there's more to this than we can fry, Mel.
Duck!
No, and I don't think they intended to.
Which way? That way?
In order to lengthen our odds, may I borrow a length of your ribbon?
Ah, we're not in the clear yet. Er, Ray tells me you've got some honey stored, Goronwy.
Excellent! Billy, Ray, you come with me and Goronwy. I've got one final thing to do.
She saved Delta's life with a warning cry. She's now into the singing time.
Certainly. We'd better get back to the Tardis, so we'll get ready to leave immediately.
Now, I need something of Delta's.
Thank you.
Are you ready, my cariad?
Head 'em up! Roll 'em out!
Stay back! The Tardis has been booby-trapped.
See up there, next to the light? There's a small beam weapon. It emits a cone of sensitivity all round the Tardis. Anything entering that cone detonates an explosion.
I don't know. It's a very sophisticated system.
I did warn you. If you'd have stepped into that beam, you'd have been atomised.
Mister Burton?
Take everyone back to the camp.
Let me stay here and try and work out how to diffuse that booby-trap, because if it explodes with its full force, it'll take us all with it.
Well, I was marking out where the sonic cone meets the ground.
Well, you see, the beam casts a shadow at the base of the Tardis. Now, if we could tunnel under the cone and come up in that shadow, then perhaps I could disarm it.
Yes, I know it's time consuming, but it's our only choice.
Apart from plan B. Run!
They're here! Ray, everyone else stay here until its safe to come out. Goronwy, have you got the beeswax? Thank you. Delta and your daughter, come with me. Barricade the door.
Oh! Excellent effort, Mister Burton, but the weapon we're using will be a little more sophisticated. Are you ready, Billy?
Right, let's roll.
All haste and no speed makes Jill a dull girl. Pass the side cutters.
A moment's impatience would mean our certain annihilation.
Ah, they've spotted us, Billy. Run!
Now!
Secure them with these.
It's over. Well done, Princess, that was wonderful. It's over, Mister Burton.
Mister Burton, it's over. It's over.
It's over, we won!
Now, come and see your new spaceship, Delta, Princess.
I know without a male the race will be wiped out, but I haven't seen many examples of species crossing. There could be the most dreadful mutation.
I can't condone this foolishness, but then, love has never been known for its rationality.
I was just speculating what this vehicle would be like with more sophisticated braking and suspension systems.
No, don't worry. Gavrok absorbed so much energy that the device has lost all its power.
Way hey. Ah, Mister Burton. Thank you for saving Mel's life.
Oh, what a sweet gesture. Oh, you're more than a collector, Goronwy. You're a man of taste.
I believe this is your satellite, gentlemen.

Mmm?
No, nearly finished, Jo.
I'm making a minimum inertia superdrive for Bessie.
Eh?
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
No.
No, nothing so exciting.
It's an assignment.
No, it's a container of some kind, Jo, from them.
That's right.
I'm not allowed to open it.
I couldn't, even if I wanted to. No, I'm not meant to. I couldn't open it, even if I wanted to. No, it's only meant for one person, and or creature. It will only open for one person.
Yeah, that's right. Yes, I'm just the messenger boy.
They only send these things in a real emergency, Jo. It's top priority, a three line whip. No, I've got to go.
I think that has already been decided.
That's out of the question. It's bound to be dangerous, probably difficult.
Sorry, Jo, a lot of rubbish. Not this time. Au revoir!
It looks like the tradesman's entrance, doesn't it.
I don't see any red carpet, do you?
We're not exactly flying, Jo. We're in planetary orbit. We must be on a
A Skybase.
We are expected then.
Well, put less delicately, Jo, delousing.
Taking their time, aren't they, Jo? Jo? Jo, where? Oh, they you are.
Mmm?
Don't use expressions like that, Jo, please.
According to the Tardis's instrument readings, we are now in the thirtieth century empire.
Your empire. Earth's empire. Yes, great colonists, Earthmen, you know, Jo. Once they'd sacked the solar system, they moved onto pastures new. Solos is one of them. One of the last. Did you ever read Gibbon's Decline and Fall?
Jo, this is like that. You see?
Oh. Well, empires rise and empires fall. And if this is their idea of a reception, this one has obviously crumbled.
Right, if we're to get out of here, I've obviously got to try and break the circuit.
What?
Oh yes, of course.
Here, you take it.
It's all right, there's nobody about. Come on.
Yes, I know. I'm not sure I like being described as a malfunction.
Hello? Hello?
Well, we can't wander around here all night with nobody noticing, now can we?
I can't hold it much longer.
I've no idea but whatever it is, it isn't friendly!
Look, you fool.
Look at his hand!
I assume I have no choice?
Mutant native, you said?
What?
Oh, yes, so you can.
Well, the Earth these people know now, Jo, in the thirtieth century empire, is even more grey and misty.
Land and sea alike, all grey. Grey cities linked by grey highways across grey deserts.
Oh, yeah. Slag, ash, clinker. The fruits of technology, Jo.
Good morning.
We come from Earth.
Overlord Centre.
Yes.
Well, they certainly had when we left.
Sometime ago now.
Look, this was an emergency.
For goodness sake, does it matter how we got here?
This is why. Jo?
Yes, well, obviously it's not for you.
Nor you, it would seem.
Well, it's a container of some kind, but I must have confess that I
I can't.
You're wasting your time, Marshal. This box will only open for the person to whom it was sent.
You see?
Oh, don't be a fool. If we were saboteurs, that'd be a bomb, and thanks to you we'd all be blown to smithereens by now.
If you really want to find out what's in this box
May I suggest that you take it to the conference. It could well be for someone there.
Bombastic signature tune, isn't it?
Does it really.
What's your view, Stubbs?
Yes, quite so.
Sorry about that, Stubbs. Well done, Jo, you did that beautifully.
Do you think so?
Come on, let's get to that conference.
Segregation.
Well, to the conference, of course.
Pass, what pass?
Look, all this has been arranged by the Administrator.
Look, this thing contains important documents. Details of the whole independence agreement, ready for signing.
What?
No, I can't open it.
The box, it's opening! Wait! This is for you!
Wait!
No, you can't!
Bad news?
Ah.
Would you kindly explain that remark, sir?
How poisonous?
May I suggest that you do so immediately?
And let her die? You can't do that!
How very convenient for you. Now look, are you going to search for Miss Grant or not?
Does it?
Apparently.
No, I'm sorry. That would be completely unethical.
All right. I'll try and open the box for you, but I shall need your most advanced laboratory facilities.
Marshal!
That's better.
Adequate. Not quite what I hoped for but adequate.
Well, I was rather hoping for a particle reversal set-up. You know, something that would turn the box inside out. But all this stuff, it seems for geared for atmosphere modulation.
And this circuit's about to overload for a start. What is it anyway, weather control?
Yes, I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid that was me. I'd no idea that the thing was operational. One of your circuits was about to overload.
You know, I can't think why you people ever came here.
Are the deposits now exhausted?
So, now you plan to colonise the planet in earnest, if you can change the atmosphere?
Well, there are other people concerned, you know?
Well, the Solonians, for example. After all, it is their planet.
I think you'll find that
That should hold the proton beam steady, Professor.
On the contrary, my dear chap, I find it a very useful research technique.
I expect the particles to reverse and for the box to turn itself inside out. What's on the outside will be on the inside, and what's on the inside will be on the outside where we can see it.
You think so? Come over here and see for yourself.
You ready? Then watch.
There are bound to be one or two snags to begin with.
Well, of course it worked.
I don't suppose you saw what it was, did you? Inside, I mean?
Was all over in a flash. Yes, I know.
Who?
Another mutant?
And now you say he's mutating?
Marshal?
I wonder, could I perhaps go on this Mutt hunt with you?
What is this place anyway? What's it for?
Get it over with? You don't intend shooting him in cold blood, do you?
How do you know?
Varan, no! Varan! Varan, wait!
Don't be a fool, Stubbs. Can't you see? There's no sign of any mutation.
I think you'd better tell us what you know, quickly! We're your only chance.
That's right. You heard Varan's story.
Yes, exactly. But now the planet's under marshal law, his nibs, as you call him, means to keep it that way.
Keep Varan in hiding. Tell the Marshal he's been dealt with. I can't move against him openly until I am sure Miss Grant is safe. I'll just have to play for time.
Dealt with.
You've found her, then? When can I see her?
A day or so?
What about Ky?
Until you let me see Miss Grant, you mean.
What you're proposing, and do correct me if I am wrong, is an all out rocket attack on a defenceless planet.
Try telling the Solonians that.
Even if it means wiping out every Solonian in the process?
Genocide is a side-effect? You ought to write a paper on that, Professor.
Yes, perhaps.
Particle reversal is one way. Not as violent as yours, of course, but the result will be the same.
Well, we could try an experiment, couldn't we?
Hmm?
Oh yes?
When can I see her, Cotton?
What?
That means I've got to find both of them. How am I going to do that?
Is there any other way to the transfer station?
Cotton, is there an emergency power supply to the transfer station?
What would happen if I blew the main power supply to the whole of Skybase?
Yes, exactly. But if the emergency power supply to the transfer station were already switched over.
Yes, exactly. Can you get the power switched over?
Good, now I'll tell you what I want you to do
Professor, I've been thinking. Perhaps we could try an experiment, just to prove whether I'm right or wrong about particle reversal.
But we'll need to link up to the main power supply.
Oh no, not a bit of it, old chap. That modulator's utterly reliable, but I'd be very grateful if you'd keep a close eye on it, would you? Well, are you ready?
Here goes.
It's all right, don't worry. Just you keep your eye on that centre dial.
Now, you listen to me, Varan. For the last time, I tell you I am not an Overlord. I've come to help your people but I must find Ky.
You will take me to Ky or I will leave you here for the guards to find. Now, do you give me your word as a warrior?
Lead the way.
What the blazes is that?
Firestorms, is that all?
It's a simple atmospheric disturbance, Varan, and something very much to our advantage.
Well, now what's the matter?
Did I say I was an Earthman?
Well, somebody's been here. I wonder why they left?
Perhaps, but I hope the answer to their mutation is in here. (the egg) Come on. Let's find Ky.
Something's going on in there. Perhaps it's Miss Grant.
What is it? Varan, the great warrior, afraid of the dark?
I'm delighted to hear it. Come on then.
This way.
Leave him alone! Go on, back! Get back! Get back. Leave him be!
Go on. Back! Go on! Go on!
So, you must be Ky. How do you do? I'm the Doctor. That's the idea. Now then, where's Miss Grant?
Steady, old chap. He did help to save your life, you know.
That's right. Now, where is she?
Good.
To find her.
And to give you this.
Perhaps these tablets are worth more to you than any weapons.
Well, read it, man. Well, what does it say? Read it!
But you've seen this kind of writing before?
Yes, but they must mean something, otherwise why would I have been sent here?
No, I'm sorry, I can't go yet.
I can't go yet. Not without Miss Grant.
Now, Varan, wait. Varan, wait!
No. Right, Ky. Take me to Miss Grant.
There must be somebody on Solos who understands the old language.
And?
Our friend the Marshal, again?
Well?
Perhaps. We'd better start searching, hadn't we?
No.
Well, we'll just have to search them all over again, won't we?
What, you heard them?
Yes. They don't attack us in the tunnels. Only in here. This chamber must be important to them.
Feel what?
Yes. Yes, it's strange. Let's keep searching. Come on.
All right. Quick, back to the chamber.
Shush! Wait. listen.
That's Jo Grant in there somewhere. Jo? Jo, are you in there? Jo?
Jo? Jo, are you all right? Jo?
Yes, it's all right. It's me.
No, Ky!
Yes, she's over here. She appears to be injured.
Yes?
Mmm hmm.
A mutant?
Well, and then what?
Well, whatever it was, it brought you back here.
Here, just a minute. I don't particularly want to find myself in the Marshal's hands again, thank you very much.
Attack?
Let me see those tablets again, Ky. The answer must be here somewhere.
Whatever it is, I think we'd better follow it. Come on.
Lead. What does lead mean to you, Jo?
Yes, exactly.
Professor Sondergaard, I presume.
This, er, increase in aggression that you speak of. It seems to be spreading.
Ky! This is not a political meeting. We're all on your side, you know, all of us.
Look, give him a chance to explain!
But you have continued with your research?
And now?
Professor Jaeger's experiments.
Yes. Yes indeed. But why was I sent here? Where do these tablets come in? Ky.
Yes, but what do they mean?
Yes, I can see that, Professor, but can you read them?
And ended, if we don't get a move on, I think.
Professor. Professor, is there another way out?
No. Sorry, Stubbs, no, you go. Take Miss Grant with you. The Professor and I have got work to do.
Jo. Look, the key to everything lies here in this room. These tablets, Professor Sondergaard's records. I must find the answer.
We shall have time.
Jo, please. Please, don't argue with me. I'll join you later.
Yes, well, they aren't numbers, so it can't be a code. Let's try something else. Fire, earth, air, water. No, all right, that's no good.
Yes, but the process keeps repeating itself. What process repeats itself?
Life in some form will always go on.
Yes.
It must be a code of some kind. It must. Eureka, it's a calendar! Spring, summer, autumn, winter.
Well, it may not tilt, Professor, but it could move closer. Look, these ellipses here, they're the orbits.
Then the seasons must be five hundred years long.
See, these signs here. They only appear in the summer. And these little matchstick men here only appear in the spring.
Yes, like small sun symbols. Well, yes, but that's it! That that's what I said. That's radiation. That's thaesium radiation! So that's why they sent me here. Professor, I want you to take me to that place where you found Jo Grant.
Any man, perhaps.
Hurry, Professor.
Where is it?
Right, there it is. How do we move it?
This way. Right?
Your helmet, Professor. Your helmet, man!
Don't worry about me. I've already prepared myself. Ready? Come on.
It's magnificent. It's like a cathedral.
Come on, we've got to get to the heart of it.
Yes, of course. The Solonians are meant to mutate. The mutation is part of it. A part of an evolution. They're meant to change as their environment changes every five hundred years. A life cycle unique in the history of the universe. And now, thanks to the Marshal, threatened with extinction.
No, it's a metamorphosis, an adaptive change. The mutants, as we know them, are an intermediate form.
Exactly. The radiation cave is the key to that.
Yes. It must play a vital part in the process, but what?
That's the extraordinary thing about it. It shows absolutely no radioactivity at all. Here, try it for yourself.
Apparently not. If only we could analyse it and find out its true function.
Skybase. Jaeger's lab.
It's rockets! That fool Jaeger's bombarding the planet with rockets. It seems to have died down for the moment. Let's get out of here and find Miss Grant and the others.
No, there's no sign of them.
No. Well, he said he was going to attack Skybase. If he ran into any of the others. Come on. Let's make for the transfer station.
It's started already. Contamination from the ionisation crystals. We've got to get out of here, Sondergaard.
My dear chap, I wouldn't hear of it.
Yes, all right. You take care, all right?
Goodbye!
Cotton.
Hello, Jo. Now then, we'll soon get you out of this.
Well, what do you want?
And if I do?
And if not?
Yes, only too easily.
Very well then.
Superior?
Marshal, you are quite mad.
Well, I gather that you've made a complete hash of things.
Mmm hmm.
Well, whatever we do, we're bound to leave a few bald patches.
Oh, no. No, no, of course not. You were simply obeying orders. That's a common excuse, Professor. Right, now I'll need a macrovisor. The strongest one you've got.
The one you use in the transfer system?
Well, we've got to use it. We'll have to train it on each affected area in turn, like a searchlight.
I am, Jaeger, I am. But we shall need the beam to transfer the effect from this laboratory to the contaminated areas.
Well, we can hardly set it up on the surface of the planet now, can we? You've seen to that.
The Marshal's?
Look, for heaven's sake, stop dilly-dallying and let's get on with it. These unstable reactions are dangerous. I shall need some equipment. If we don't come up with an effective control system, we'll particle reverse Skybase and we'll be in a bigger mess than we were before.
What's that?
Huh? Oh, right. Carry on.
You do realise, Professor, that the slightest accident in this stage of the proceedings.
Tut, tut, tut. The slightest accident in this stage of the proceedings and we'd all reverse instantly into antimatter. Blasted out to the other side of the universe, as a flash of electromagnetic radiation. We'll all become unpeople, undoing unthings untogether. Fascinating.
Got it. Right, all we've got to do is switch on now and see what happens. Or unhappens as the case may be. All right, lower away, will you?
By the way, I didn't tell you, did I, Professor Sondergaard and I think we've discovered the secret behind the mutations. It's not a disease at all.
Now let it build up, Professor. More. More.
Right. Now here goes. Activation beginning.
What's the reading?
The nitrogen isotope level?
Good, then that's how it stays.
No!
Well, Marshal, it seems as if your superiors have arrived. What are you going to do now?
Criminal?
Perhaps I can explain.
He means they were all plague victims. They use the caves as a refuge.
Yes. Mutant natives, sir. It's a local term. Medically speaking, accelerated genetic metamorphosis.
I am, yes.
Practically everything.
Yes, sir. Yes, I would.
Investigator, these are the missing witnesses. Jo, Miss Grant here, is my assistant, kept hostage
Kept hostage to ensure my cooperation in this travesty of justice. Investigator, I accuse that man and that man of the most brutal and callous series of crimes against a defenceless people it's ever been my misfortune to encounter.
You destroyed these poor people for no reason at all.
Not died, Marshal, changed.
Duty? Your idea of duty was to keep this planet for yourself.
Need I say more, Investigator?
Yes, yes, of course.
Er, no, I'm sorry, sir, I forgot. The tablets are in the care of Professor Sondergaard.
I'm not sure, sir. Somewhere on the surface of Solos, I believe.
Well, I can only reassure you that
As I say, I can assure you, sir, that conclusive evidence does exist.
This present mutation is one of a series of adaptive changes, sir. Solos is moving out of spring into summer, and that is why the Solonians are changing.
This, sir, this is Professor Sondergaard, who's worked and lived on Solos for many years. He can tell you better than I what the Marshal has been doing there.
Don't worry, Professor. We're holding a much needed investigation. Thank heavens you've arrived just in time to tell the Investigator of our discoveries.
Jo, take this key. Lock the door.
Yes, yes, of course.
Yes. Now, all we've got to do is analyse its structure.
Yes, well, we haven't got hours, but we do have this. It will help me to accelerate the process, I think.
I'm being as quick as I can, Jo.
Yes, of course. Of course! The crystal acts as a bio-catalytic agent. Sondergaard, take this crystal to Ky immediately. But what about the thaesium radiation? Surely that's the vital part of the process?
Well, what else can we do? We must try it. If we hope to achieve a successful mutation, that is.
So, you've managed to wriggle out of trouble, have you?
Congratulations. Well, what do you want now?
It's all right, Investigator. He's quite mad.
Almost. And my companions?
Yes.
You do realise, Marshal, that you're about to destroy a life form unique in the history of the universe?
As you wish.
Change of heart, Marshal?
Get down.
Right, out!
Professor Sondergaard has agreed to stay on Solos and see as many of the Solonians as possible through to the stage that Ky has already achieved.
They were premature mutations, Jo. The cycle of changes was triggered off too soon. Rather like butterflies that hatch out on a cold spring day. Their instincts were too confused to seek out and use the crystal.
Yes, yes, of course, but I wonder whether you'd excuse us for the moment, Investigator? My assistant is feeling rather faint.
No, Jo, no you have been rather overdoing it, you know, and you
You don't look too well.
Come on. Will you excuse us? We'll see you all, later.
Well, here we are.
The storage area where we left the Tardis.
Oh, no. They've locked it again.
Give me that.
Yes, well at least we've made a clean sweep of this place. Jo?

And such a simple repair job.
Well, you know how it is. You put things off for a day, next thing you know it's a hundred years later.
Mmm.
Let's see if it works.
Perfect.
And now we have nothing to look at. Couldn't be better. Peace and quiet is just what the doctor ordered.
Well, there's nothing urgent, is there?
No. Well, you see, ever since the Cybermen damaged the console
Yes. Well, nobody's perfect.
Sensors show we're converging with a massive source of magnetic radiation.
Well, something's causing it. We must change course.
Anywhere, so as long as it's away from here.
I don't know.
I know.
I can't control the Tardis!
I just tried.
Something's coming through.
No, extradimensional.
Quick, Nyssa, out of here!
No! No!
How long have I been here?
From another dimension.
From the Tardis, yes.
Well, for a moment it did. What you saw was an attempted temporal bonding. The molecular realignment of two basically incompatible lifeforms.
Are you sure? Then it's worse than I feared.
Oh, it is somewhere, and halfway to achieving its purpose. It won't have given up that easily.
Matter and anti-matter in collision. Yes, I take your point. Come on, we've got work to do.
They're very rare. On burnout it creates quardal magnetism. That's what the sensors picked up. It's the only force known to shield anti-matter.
Has to be. But it's known to decay rapidly. Anything else?
That's it, Nyssa. That's how it came through. What we saw was the gateway to the dimensions. The Arc of Infinity.
Right.
Which in my case exists only in the Matrix on Gallifrey.
Hmm. This creature controls the shift of the Arc. Just think of it, Nyssa. With such power you can unlock the door to travel between the dimensions of matter and anti-matter.
High Council of Time Lords. We're being taken back to Gallifrey.
I don't know. It must be urgent. Only twice before in our history has the recall circuit been used.
The security compound in the heart of the Citadel.
Well, they're taking no chances.
Handprint activated, from the outside. Fetch my indent kit from the workbench, will you? I might just be able to trip it. Quickly!
Not now, Nyssa.
I wish I could believe that.
It won't be that easy to track this creature down. The universe is rather a big place. And there is an easier alternative.
Possibly.
I doubt it. Not with this kind of lock. And certainly not as quickly.
This way.
The computer room. It's not far now.
Well, they certainly know we've arrived.
Quickly!
Hello, I'm the Doctor.
Not the most welcoming return.
That's the only way to keep me and the Tardis here.
We need a link. Something to prove the connection between this creature and Gallifrey.
There's no need for all the fire power.
The Council Chamber, I suppose.
My companion is not involved in this.
Councillors.
And you, Hedin. Nyssa, my old friend, Councillor Hedin. Councillors, my companion, Nyssa of Traken.
Given the chance, I would have returned willingly.
Romana chose to stay in E-space.
Yes. Well, now that I'm here, Thalia, have you given any thought to what's happened?
Has anyone checked to see if my biodata extracts have been removed from the Matrix, Castellan?
I would have thought that was obvious. None of this could have happened unless the creature had that information.
Indeed, President Borusa.
Without knowing its purpose here.
Lord President, this creature is here now because it bonded with me. To do so it needed something very special, full and precise details of my biological makeup. Now, I didn't pass this information on. Somebody did. The question is who.
Chancellor, can bonding occur without the full imprint of a so-called bioscan?
Lord President, I ask for time to have this fully investigated.
I have a great deal to say.
Executing me will not alter the fact there's a traitor at work on Gallifrey!
Damon!
He is a friend of mine.
You don't have to relish them so much.
Your guards will not allow me to leave the console room.
If I'm to die, I want to prepare myself mentally. For that I need to be alone.
My companion's. It has already been searched.
My bioscan.
So soon? What about my appeal?
How did you get in here?
Well, that's very generous of the Castellan. Come, we'll walk while we speak.
Excellent. Well, Damon, what news of my old companion Leela?
I was so sorry to miss her wedding. Still, perhaps I'll get to see her before I (out of range)
In here. Maxil has just planted a listening device in the console room. Well now, we have proof my biodata extract was removed from the Matrix.
Indeed. And a disaster in the making. Unless I'm mistaken, Gallifrey could lose control of the space-time Matrix.
That's exactly what the High Council think. So, we must see what we can do to stop it happening. Look, Damon, I know you've already risked a great deal for me, but could I impose on you a little further?
I need another space-time element for the Tardis. Preferably without a recall circuit.
Yes. You could check to see if the Matrix is aware of any details concerning power equipment, movement, transportation.
Well, Commander, our time is up so soon. Well, Nyssa, that's my final word. No appeals. We must accept the decision of the High Council. Understood?
I trust you know what you are doing?
And the decision was unanimous?
Thank you, Hedin. I much appreciate all you've done.
No! Nyssa, I will not have blood spilt to save my life.
They're right, Nyssa. We cannot escape.
Please. You must obey the Lord President. I know what I'm doing. The weapon, please?
Lord President, my companion acted from misguided loyalty. She will cause no further trouble. In return, I ask that she is allowed to go free.
Who are you?
I must be in the Matrix.
I knew you couldn't let me die.
I guessed. Besides, I hoped it would give me the chance to meet you.
It'd difficult to say without knowing who you are.
If you have something to offer the Time Lords, why not speak directly?
Then you must be known to Gallifrey.
It would mean losing control of the Matrix to you. The price is too high.
All right, let's talk. Do you hear me?
That's very generous of you. May I ask what I've done to deserve it?
I will do everything I can to stop you.
Tegan!
No, it's a trick. It's not Tegan.
It can't be. Tegan's on Earth. I know she is.
All right. Whatever you say.
As yours depends on mine.
Wait!
Pity. Long cancelled, I expect. Presidential code. Four five, four? Four five, five! Three nine one.
Three nine one. Three nine one. Three nine one. Six five nine two!
Pure luck.
There wasn't time, Nyssa. Damon, did you do as I asked?
What about the power equipment? Anything turn up?
Fusion?
What, from water?
Now listen, Damon, this is very important. I need to know the precise destination and who sent it. Do you think you could find that out?
We're going to Earth, Nyssa.
That's where this creature is.
It's got Tegan. I saw her in the Matrix.
Pity.
Who?
The Lord President.
Well, we must see the Lord President immediately.
Thank you for all your help, Damon. I shall never be able to repay you.
Nyssa.
No!
Come on! Come on. In here.
Come on.
Hedin, you don't believe this stuff about the Lord President?
What is it?
So it's you.
The bioscan, the rigged termination, all your work, Hedin?
It was all done to make us think you were responsible, Lord President. And now, Hedin?
It's that close?
I always considered you a friend, Hedin. A man of learning, respected by all. Why now turn to evil?
This creature will soon control the Matrix. Is that what you want?
Omega?
But Omega died.
Omega is insane. Once in control of the Matrix
You fool. He could have told us where Omega is.
Lord President, we must shut down the Matrix.
No, but it could delay it, give us time to hunt Omega down.
It's too late. Omega controls the Matrix.
We know who you are.
You seriously believe you can reverse what happened?
Omega, listen!
We know he's on Earth.
Perhaps, but I would have to enter the Matrix to find out.
Please, Nyssa
Wait in the Tardis! Please.
Even if we know where Omega is, can the Tardis leave Gallifrey?
Well, Omega, you've won. We can't stop you now.
That was an accident. Is Tegan safe?
Prove it. Let me speak to her.
I told you, you've won. Even if we know where you are, we can't leave Gallifrey. You know that.
She's unharmed?
Yes.
Don't worry, Tegan's unharmed.
As soon as you give the word.
We're clear. Come on, Nyssa.
One or two things I've got to get together.
Good.
Omega's using a fusion booster to build up energy to transfer. If we can attach this, it should knock it out of phase.
Hopefully it'll feed the power back through his own equipment.
Exactly. How's the meter?
I don't believe it.
I think we made it. Come on.
When I spoke to Tegan, she mentioned her cousin and the JHC.
She risked her life to give us that piece of information. If we find out what the JHC is, it might lead us to where she is.
We'll start with the telephone directory.
Won't we? JHC, JHC, JHC, JHC, JHC Jeugdherberg Central Youth Hostels. Must be where Tegan was staying.
Well, there's not many of them. We'll give them a ring. Ah. Nyssa, money?
Afraid so. Anti-matter present but steady. Omega hasn't transferred yet, but it can't be much longer.
If only it were that easy.
No other choice. We must check every hostel on foot.
Can't risk it. Might alert Omega. This way.
Well, there's no other way.
We go on, Nyssa.
No, they've done all they can, and now it's up to us.
We'll try one more hostel, then we'll split up. Divide our effort.
Well, it can't be long. I fear Omega is about to transfer.
And what about her cousin?
Yes. Sorry. Well, thank you.
Yes.
No. Tegan is our only link.
Yes.
May I see?
Frankendael. Where is that?
Could you show me?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Er, it's very near.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
Frankendael!
It's only a matter of minutes. The fountain! Tegan said behind the fountain.
Well, that depends on the form Omega's given his Tardis. Listen.
Yes, perfect.
Of course. I've been so silly. Amsterdam is located on the curve of the Arc, below sea level to maintain pressure for fusion conversion.
The fusion booster from Gallifrey.
Nyssa!
Nyssa! Fire, Nyssa!
An Ergon. One of Omega's less successful attempts at psychosynthesis. Quickly.
It's too late, Omega. You can't transfer now.
The Arc of Infinity is shifting. Go, Omega, please, while you still have a chance.
Down!
No. The bond is not complete.
It's not permanent. It will fail, revert to anti-matter.
I must find the matter converter. I can't destroy Omega without it. Tegan, help me!
Tegan, hurry!
Yes. He'd want to hide himself in the crowd. Well, at least we have some idea of what he's wearing.
The biggest explosion this part of the universe is ever likely to witness.
He can't be far ahead.
I don't know. The magnetic shield is in accelerated decay now.
He'll revert to anti-matter.
(shouts, lying) I see you, Omega.
This way.
He'll be all right.
He'll be all right.
I warned you this would happen, Omega.
We didn't hate you, Omega. Why couldn't you be content to survive as you were? Why?
I can expel or destroy you, Omega. It's your choice.
Willing his own destruction. Don't force me, Omega.
It's over.
Well, he seemed to die before, yet he returned to confound us all.
Excellent.
It's been marvellous to see you again.
So it seems.

Yes?
Isn't it in your rucksack?
Interesting question.
No.
What's that peculiar noise?
How extraordinary.
It materialised inside the Tardis. Just the kind of thing you'd expect to see in this part of the galaxy.
Not entirely, no.
Yes, junk mail gets everywhere.
Oh, Ace, I thought you'd have been interested in the circus.
What, you found them funny?
I think you're being very unfair. A lot of the acts in the circus require a great deal of skill and courage. That's something you should appreciate. Anyway, I rather fancy entering the Festival talent contest myself.
Shall we just fling it away and forget about it? I mean, I'm sure the Psychic Circus isn't scary at all. It's just a device to get us to go.
So this is Segonax. Not quite the green and pleasant land we'd been led to expect. Still, I've had good reports of the friendliness of the natives.
Oh, I expect that's for those not fortunate enough to possess a Tardis.
I'll ask for directions over there.
Good afternoon. I'm the Doctor, this is my friend Ace.
I don't understand.
Ah, and what type might that be?
Let's not be hasty.
Elementary diplomacy, my dear Ace. She apparently thinks we're a pair of undesirable intergalactic hippies. We must try and convince her we're nice, clean-living people who eat up all our fresh fruit and pay our way.
Every last bite. Besides, we want the charming lady to tell us how to find the circus, don't we. Delicious, madam. Quite delicious.
Er, no. Delicious but extremely filling. I'm sure you will have gathered by now, dear lady, we're not the kind of hobbledyhoys and vagabonds you take such exception to. Indeed, as I said before, I'm known as the Doctor.
Yes, well, be that as it may, we would appreciate your help. You see, we're looking for
Go where?
I don't understand. You say that he's going to the circus?
Is it far, this appalling spectacle?
No, no, the very idea, no. Just a moment, would you excuse me?
Ace, any chance of a lift, do you think?
Yes, yes, never mind, Ace. Let's concentrate on getting a lift to the circus. Excuse me. If you're going to the circus, I wonder if could possibly give
No, not really, no.
Well, there's nothing like a nice walk in the countryside.
Now, now, now, it could be worse. You could be carrying that heavy rucksack of yours.
They seem to be in rather a hurry. Looking for customers.
That's true. But then, how do they expect a hard case like him to going to the circus anyway?
Something evil's happened here, I can feel it.
Who knows.
Greetings. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Ace.
Well, I could be wrong, of course, but isn't it from the Groz Valley of Melogothon?
Oh, Ace, wait a minute.
Well as a matter of fact, I was.
Why come here, then?
I said, why bother to come here?
Do you often travel together?
Of what?
I never think of Ace as a specimen of anything.
I suppose it was buried for some good reason.
Quick. Help, Captain.
I've seen ones like this quite often enough, thank you very much.
A shrine or not, I can't help feeling something sinister happened here.
Not everything. I trust my instincts, and you may recall they're not always wrong.
Ace, I wouldn't.
I would like a ticket, actually. I'd like a there and back off peak weekend break supersaver senior citizen bimonthly season with optional added facilities a free cup of coffee in a plastic glass a crocodile sandwich and make it snappy, you mechanic moron!
If I might take a look at that ticket machine of yours?
Ah, yes.
Just the ticket.
Some people can't bear to be proved wrong.
Oh, let's not bear a grudge. He can't help being a pompous, selfish, self-satisfied meddler.
If a little odd.
Do you like it?
Well, if the keeper's not here, the finder has it.
Presumably. Whoever attacked them, destroyed them and wrecked the bus.
Yes, I think so. Anyway, whoever left him here on guard's gone now. Perhaps millennia ago.
I'm afraid I think not. No, that was all just good publicity.
Yes. I feel just in the right mood. And after two brushes with death in one day, I hope you might be.
Ah, so, Doctor. You can remember.
Not as far as we feared. Look.
Nonsense.
Listen, they're having a good time in there.
Hear what?
I can't hear anything.
Oh, you're just making excuses because you don't like circuses.
Well, are we going in or aren't we?
But not now.
So we can go in?
Your enthusiasm's overwhelming.
Ace, you promised. (to Morgana) I'm the Doctor and this is Ace. I must apologise for my young friend.
We?
Ah, I see.
I wonder if you've a special skill, if I might enquire.
Not just yet.
The Psychic Circus has grown into quite a sizeable operation, by the looks of it.
Quite so, yes. My, you have travelled, haven't you? The planet Othris, the Boriatic Wastes, Marpesia and the Grand Pagoda of Cinethon.
Since?
So I've been told. Personally, I just keep on wandering.
Ace?
Well, are we going in or aren't we?
Yes, that's why we came here in the first place.
Thank you. Oh, tickets. We forgot to buy some tickets.
To go in.
Oh. Sounds as if you're doing really good business.
Yes?
Neither can I.
Perhaps we're between performances. Let's see if we can find a seat.
That's one way of looking at it, if we could see. Over here.
I said, over here.
In a moment our eyes'll get used to the darkness.
Listen.
We're not alone.
Perhaps they haven't arrived yet. Who knows? Anyway, I'm going to have an ice cream.
Greetings. Not many in today, are there. Are you regulars or is this your first visit, too? Let me introduce myself. I'm
Oh, thank you very much. Delicious.
Well, it's been a pleasure.
Remarkable.
No, no, I mean the memorial stones. Do you see them? Look.
Oh, thank you, but
Well, I'm not really sure that I should.
Well, this is most unexpected. Are you sure you want me?
Why, what harm could it do?
Well, you certainly didn't waste any time. I had expected to see what the opposition was up to before I put myself forward for the talent contest.
But since you insist.
Well, yes, I
Oh, thank you very much. Ace!
Thank you very much, but where's Ace? I don't think she
Captain Cook, I presume. So you had arrived after all.
Well, I don't really think I
Very well then. Mags. Do sit down, Doctor.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
It's a trap! I've fallen into a trap! I've fallen for it.
Why?
Why let me be trapped? It's so pointless. I could have saved you, Nord and Mags.
What about you? I mean, why didn't you speak up?
What kind of answer's that?
What is all this, then? I thought there was a talent contest going on.
What a fool I've been.
I should have listened to Ace.
What happens in there?
In the ring, during the talent contest.
You were lucky, Captain.
What am I supposed to do with these?
Why, do they let you out again?
It frightens you, doesn't it, Mags?
You saw what happened in there?
Aren't you going to tell me about it?
What do you mean?
Is this what you saw before?
Would you let something like that happen to you?
Ready?
I believe I'm on first.
No, you're not.
I insist on going out first.
Oh yes, I do!
Look, I insist in going on first.
I am!
Join the club. Captain?
No. Oh, we should have made straight away for the open air, I suppose.
How extraordinary. They're just like the stones in the Big Top. Fascinating. I wonder how long they've been here?
That thought had occurred to me. Let's investigate.
See what?
The moon? Why does it frighten you? Tell me.
Oh, nasty little booby trap, that. That is, if it is a booby trap. Still, there's certainly no way forward.
One way to find out.
That eye, I've seen it before. Of course, it was on the kites at the entrance hall. Fascinating. Somehow, somewhere down there is the answer to all that's going on at the Psychic Circus.
But we were on the edge of discovering the secret of the Psychic Circus. Doesn't that interest you at all?
Of course, of course.
Things are beginning to get out of control quicker than I expected.
Fun for all the family? I don't know how they've got the nerve.
Hello, Deadbeat. Fancy meeting you here. Small world, isn't it. It frightened you to see that eye, didn't it. It means the powers behind it are on the move again. Something happened to you here. You haven't always been like this. Did you try and find something out? Were you punished? Can you understand anything I'm saying? Well, there's one thing I do know, Deadbeat. You're not going to give me away to the others. Are you?
Lead on, Deadbeat.
Deadbeat, I take it all back. (to Ace) You're absolutely right. Clowns can be creepy.
Something went wrong?
And a friendly hippy circus was turned into a trap for killing people.
And the well?
You don't know anything about a well with an eye peering out from inside?
Listen, Ace.
The answers. You know what happened, don't you, Deadbeat?
Deadbeat, if we take you to the well, can you show us what it did?
Well, he brought me here to you and Bellboy. He must have done that for a purpose.
Ah, now there's something there, Ace. I saw it when he looked into the crystal ball.
There might be something in that, yes. Anyway, we'd better be going. Bellboy?
So be it, then, Bellboy. Come on, Deadbeat. Or should I call you Kingpin? We've got work to do.
Now, Kingpin, show us what you did when you first saw the eye.
He must have used that medallion to summon the powers that lurk here.
Yes.
Yes, that eye seems to plague us everywhere, only with the eyeball removed by someone or something.
In the bus.
It's so tantalising. I'm so close to understanding it all and yet so far.
Exactly. Now, you take Kingpin back to the bus and find it, but be careful.
I'm going back to the ring.
The Psychic Circus needs acts. If they've got me then perhaps they won't worry about you two for the moment.
Anybody remotely interesting is mad in someway or another.
I believe you've been looking for me. I'm wanted backstage.
Greetings, Captain Cook. Mags. You will be pleased to hear that the greatest act in the galaxy has returned to the fold.
I know, Mags, and I haven't wasted the time you bought me. And I have returned with an idea. I suggest that this time we all three work together.
Up to now all the people in the cage have been played off against each other, and of course some people are cleverer at preserving themselves than others.
Not entirely. What I'm proposing is that we all three go into the ring. Three for one and one for three. That should throw a very big hammer into the works.
Those powers destroyed Deadbeat.
You're meddling with things you don't understand.
Captain Cook!
You're not only a scoundrel and a meddling fool, but you're also a crushing bore.
Mags! Mags! Do you hear me? Mags!
Mags, when you're like this, this isn't in your nature, you have to destroy everything that crosses your path. I don't believe that. Mags!
Mags! Mags! Wait, wait. I need your mercy, but you don't have to kill.
No, Mags! No!
Come on, Mags. We've got to run away, now.
Mags!
Something dreadful's happening in the ring. Things are getting out of control quicker than I expected.
Nothing will satisfy them but my presence.
No. You must run and get Ace and Deadbeat.
I must prepare for my entrance. Never keep your audience waiting.
I'm coming. Open a pathway for me. Once small step for mankind, one great leap, or words to that effect.
And here we all are at last. I'm surprised you brought me here. It must be very difficult for you, trying to exist concurrently in two different time spaces. I know the problem myself. No wonder those memorial stones looked familiar. The Gods of Ragnarok, I presume.
How many people have you destroyed, I wonder, before Kingpin was lured down here. Poor Kingpin. That's what you like, isn't it. Taking someone with a touch of individuality and imagination, and wearing them down to nothingness in your service.
Enough? I've hardly started. I have fought the Gods of Ragnarok all through time.
Don't tell me what you want me to do. Let me guess. Now let me see. You want me to
Predictable as ever, Gods of Ragnarok. As I think it's been said before, or was it after? Anyway, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for that overwhelming reception. And now, I would like to begin like life, at the beginning. But how did life begin? Was it with a chicken or was it with
You're not interested in beginnings. You're only interested in endings.
What, no complaints? No arguments? No thunderbolts?
Let me guess. Give yourself enough rope and you hang yourself.
A piece of rope has two ends, Father Ragnarok.
Yes?
Really? I thought I was entertaining you.
Do you now?
Do I have your full attention?
The climax of my act, Gods of Ragnarok, requires something you do not possess in great abundance. That is, imagination. And it starts with a piece of metal. This piece of metal once belonged to a sword, and that sword belonged to a gladiator.
And that gladiator fought and died in this ring to entertain you.
I have fed you enough, Gods of Ragnarok, and you found what I have to offer indigestible. So I have taken myself off the menu. La comedia e finita.
I already have.
Probably not. It's all a matter of timing, don't you know.
Enjoying the show, Ace?
Yes. But you're just about to start.
What better way for a circus to begin than with a wonderful new act.
Oh, you can, Mags. You already have.
Thank you, Kingpin, but I'm afraid we've got other galaxies to travel. And besides, I find circuses a little sinister.

Highly satisfactory.
Oh nonsense, my boy. It's perfectly safe in there. Yes, France. Yes, most certainly.
Hmm!
Well, by the look of those houses I would say medieval. Although I suppose it might be as late as the seventeenth century. I
Did you see that? We've landed in the middle of the sixteenth century. Yes, and that was the very time.
Yes. That strange brotherhood of apothecaries. Way ahead of their time. Now, what was the name of that man that lived in Paris? Er, Pre, Preslin! Preslin! That's the man. Yes. The most advanced man of them all. I must try to get to see him.
Quite so, dear boy. Well, now, don't let us dawdle. We must go in and change.
You'd be surprised what I've got in my wardrobe. But I want to turn over a few old papers. Yes, come along, there's no time to lose. Come along. Come along, come along!
It won't be of the least interest to you, dear boy. Landlord! Wine.
I shall do nothing of the sort. I am going to visit Preslin. He lives on the other side of Paris, somewhere near Port Saint Martin, I believe. Thank you. I just want to sit down and have a talk with him about his work. Are you interested in germinology?
Well, there you are, you see. And you know nothing about the period do you? You'd only be found out for the man that you are.
Well, in that case I shan't visit Preslin.
Well.
But you promise me you won't get into trouble?
Well try not to talk to anyone. And come back here this evening and we'll go off to the Tardis together.
Quite, quite. You'll need that.
And don't cut yourself with that sword.
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
I am looking for Charles Preslin.
Oh, but this is his shop?
Where?
Oh dear, dear, dear. Now isn't that a pity. And I did so want to talk to him about his work.
Trouble? Not at all. I'm a scientist too. I merely wish to discuss his work with him.
Yes, perhaps to you, but he was a man who searched deeply in nature. I didn't think he was a faint heart.
I see. Yes. He also discovered, small creatures which, if attacking humanity, could cause a very serious illness.
No.
Yes. In science, news travels. Yes. And there's a man in Germany at the moment, who's working on optics, trying to make a machine which will enable Preslin to see these small creatures. He calls them germs.
Yes. So now, doesn't this encourage you to continue with your theories, Monsieur Preslin?
Of course, of course, my dear fellow. But I'm extremely curious about your work, Monsieur Preslin.
But, who is this Abbot?
Yes, I suppose just now all churchmen are rather suspicious of your work. But surely you can carry on without his knowledge?
I suppose there's no point in going to see him?
Hmm, I wonder.
He is not.
Oh, my dear boy, had you stayed at the tavern all this mix-up could have been avoided.
Yes, well, I was unavoidably delayed. Never mind that now. Come along, we must go. Come along.
What? Oh, that wretched curfew is the start of so much trouble.
I told you not to get involved.
What's that?
Did you say tomorrow was Saint Bartholomew's Day, child?
What year is this, my boy?
What date is it, child?
Yes, yes, yes, I know that. The year, the year, hmm?
Go home, Anne. You must leave here at once.
Where were you working?
You go back there.
You must leave this shop, child.
Oh, please don't interfere. Now, my dear, there must be somewhere you can stay in Paris.
Oh, nonsense. Tonight you will be quite safe. Now you go carefully through the streets.
Well, you've been out in the curfew before, haven't you?
Then you know how to avoid the patrols. You go back to your aunt. You'll be quite safe. And you take my advice and stay indoors tomorrow. Now do you understand? It's too dangerous for you to stay here. Now off you go, child. Come along, off, off, off.
Ah, sh sh sh sh sh sh sh.
Now off you go, my child. Off you go.
My dear Steven, the Catholics will have other things on their minds tonight. She will be quite safe. Now then, you and I must leave Paris at once. Come!
There is no time for me to explain. Come along, boy. Come along!
Yes, we shall have to get past them to get back to the Tardis.
Oh no, no. It's far too dangerous.
For the moment we just wait.
I know, I know. Just keep quiet.
There's the tocsin! The curfew's been lifted.
No, nothing. Nothing. In any case, I cannot change the course of history, you know that. The massacre continued for several days in Paris and then spread itself to other parts of France. Oh, what a senseless waste. What a terrible page of the past.
Yes, most of them. About ten thousand in Paris alone.
Yes.
Anne Chaplet?
Well, it is possible of course she didn't die, and I was right to leave her.
I was not responsible.
We've landed. Your mind is made up?
My dear Steven, history sometimes gives us a terrible shock, and that is because we don't quite fully understand. Why should we? After all, we're all too small to realise its final pattern. Therefore don't try and judge it from where you stand. I was right to do as I did. Yes, that I firmly believe.
Even after all this time he cannot understand. I dare not change the course of history. Well, at least I taught him to take some precautions. He did remember to look at the scanner before he opened the doors. Now they're all gone. All gone. None of them could understand. Not even my little Susan, or Vicki. And as for Barbara and Chatterton. Chesterton. They were all too impatient to get back to their own time. And now, Steven. Perhaps I should go home, back to my own planet. But I can't. I can't.
Who are you?
What did you say?
Oh, pull yourself together, child. I think you've made a mistake.
Oh, good gracious. Of course not.
Yes, yes. I know. But, er, it isn't, if you know what I mean. Now run along and find another police box. In any case, child, what do you want to do with the police?
Oh, well, I'm afraid I can't help you. No, you must run along and phone the police somewhere else. And the same time phone for an ambulance.
Well, my dear, I'm a doctor of science, and this machine is for travelling through time and relative dimensions in space. Now you
Oh, never mind, my dear, never mind. Run along.
Oh please, child.
Oh, so you've come back, my boy!
Policemen? Coming here? Good gracious me! They'll want to use the telephone or something like it.
Well, tell me, young man, what made you change your mind?
What else could I do, dear boy? You don't want a couple of policemen aboard the Tardis do you? You know, you're the most inconsistent young man? Just now you were telling me off for not having that Chaplet girl aboard!
There now, you see? All this fuss about nothing. But don't you think she looks rather like my grandchild Susan?
Oh, no, no, no, no, of course not, no. Yes, but she does you know. What is your name, child?
What?
Yes, yes, it is possible, my boy. Very possible. Welcome aboard the Tardis, Miss Dorothea Chaplet.
Oh, my dear! My dear!

Don't know. Some kind of signal drawing the Tardis off course.
Earth. Utah, North America. About half a mile underground.
Two thousand and twelve.
An alien museum. Someone's got a hobby. They must have spent a fortune on this. Chunks of meteorite, moon dust. That's the milometer from the Roswell spaceship.
Oh, look at you.
An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old.
No, it's stone dead. The signal's alive. Something's reaching out, calling for help.
I really wouldn't hold it like that.
Really, though, that's wrong.
No, it just looks silly.
You just need to be
Delicate.
And it's a long way from home.
I did say delicate. It reacts to the smallest fingerprint. It needs precision.
Very good. Quite the expert.
I'm the Doctor. And who are you?
Pretty much sums me up, yeah.
So you're just about an expert in everything except the things in your museum. Anything you don't understand, you lock up.
I don't need to make claims, I know how good I am.
You tell me.
And what's that?
Show me.
Inside? Inside what?
Metaltron?
I won't touch it then.
Look, I'm sorry about this. Mister Van Statten might think he's clever, but never mind him. I've come to help. I'm the Doctor.
Impossible.
Let me out!
It's not working.
Fantastic! Oh, fantastic! Powerless! Look at you. The great space dustbin. How does it feel?
What for? What're you going to do to me? If you can't kill, then what are you good for, Dalek? What's the point of you? You're nothing.
What the hell are you here for?
What does that mean?
Well you're never going to get any. Not ever.
They're never going to come! Your race is dead! You all burnt, all of you. Ten million ships on fire. The entire Dalek race wiped out in one second.
I watched it happen. I made it happen.
I had no choice.
Dead. They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War. Everyone lost.
Oh, and I caught your little signal. Help me. Poor little thing. But there's no one else coming 'cause there's no one else left.
Yep.
We're not the same! I'm not (pause) No, wait. Maybe we are. You're right. Yeah, okay. You've got a point. 'Cause I know what to do. I know what should happen. I know what you deserve. Exterminate.
Why should I? You never did.
You've got to destroy it!
The metal's just battle armour. The real Dalek creature's inside.
A nightmare. It's a mutation. The Dalek race was genetically engineered. Every single emotion was removed except hate.
By a genius, Van Statten. By a man who was king of his own little world. You'd like him.
Because I'm here. How did it get to Earth? Does anyone know?
It must have fallen through time. The only survivor.
The Time War. The final battle between my people and the Dalek race.
Not by choice.
So that's your secret. You don't just collect this stuff, you scavenge it.
Do you know what a Dalek is, Van Statten? A Dalek is honest. It does what it was born to do for the survival of its species. That creature in your dungeon is better than you.
Listen to me! That thing downstairs is going to kill every last one of us!
But it's woken up. It knows I'm here. It's going to get out. Van Statten, I swear, no one on this base is safe. No one on this planet!
Release me if you want to live.
You've got to keep it in that cell.
A Dalek's a genius. It can calculate a thousand billion combinations in one second flat.
Rose, get out of there!
It's downloading.
It's not just energy. That Dalek just absorbed the entire internet. It knows everything.
We've only got emergency power. It's eaten everything else. You've got to kill it now!
This museum of yours. Have you got any alien weapons?
Leaving everyone trapped with it. Rose is down there. I won't let that happen. Have you got that? It's got to go through this area. What's that?
Give guns to the technicians, the lawyers, anyone. Everyone. Only then have you got a chance of killing it.
What's the nearest town?
Population?
All dead. If the Dalek gets out, it'll murder every living creature. That's all it needs.
Because it honestly believes they should die. Human beings are different, and anything different is wrong. It's the ultimate in racial cleansing and you, Van Statten, you've let it loose! The Dalek's surrounded by a force field. The bullets are melting before they even hit home, but it's not indestructible.
If you concentrate your fire, you might get through. Aim for the dome, the head, the eyepiece.
That's the weak spot.
It wants us to see.
You said we could seal the vault.
We've got emergency power. We can re-route that to the bulkhead doors.
You want to help?
You're going to get rusty.
What's your next trick?
Yeah, I saw. downloading the internet. What did you find?
And?
You're just a soldier without commands.
What for? What's the point? Don't you see it's all gone? Everything you were, everything you stood for.
All right, then. If you want orders, follow this one. Kill yourself.
The Daleks have failed! Why don't you finish the job and make the Daleks extinct. Rid the Universe of your filth. Why don't you just die?
Seal the Vault.
Are you enjoying this?
Where are you?
You've got to keep moving. The vault's being sealed off up at level forty six.
I'm the one who's closing them. I can't wait and I can't help you.
Now for God's sake, run.
I'm sorry.
Rose, where are you? Rose, did you make it?
I killed her.
I said I'd protect her. She was only here because of me, and you're sorry? I could've killed that Dalek in it's cell, but you stopped me.
Your collection? But was it worth it? Worth all those men's deaths? Worth Rose? Let me tell you something, Van Statten. Mankind goes into space to explore, to be part of something greater.
You just want to drag the stars down and stick them underground, underneath tons of sand and dirt, and label them. You're about as far from the stars as you can get. And you took her down with you. She was nineteen years old.
You were quick on your feet, leaving Rose behind.
You're alive!
I thought you were dead.
I killed her once. I can't do it again.
Broken. Broken. Hairdryer.
What, you in a fight? I'd like to see that.
What're you going to do, throw your A-Levels at 'em? Oh, yes. Lock and load.
Get out of the way. Rose, get out of the way now!
That thing killed hundreds of people.
I've got to do this. I've got to end it. The Daleks destroyed my home, my people. I've got nothing left.
What's it doing?
But it can't
I couldn't. I wasn't. Oh, Rose. They're all dead.
I don't know.
You're not even that. Rose did more than regenerate you. You've absorbed her DNA. You're mutating.
Something new. I'm sorry.
Not for a Dalek.
A little piece of home. Better than nothing.
I'm the only one left. I win. How about that?
I'd know. In here. (his head) Feels like there's no one.
Yeah.
Better hurry up then. Next flight to Heathrow leaves at fifteen hundred hours.
Tell him to go and stand outside, then.
He left you down there.
Plus, he's a bit pretty.
On your own head.

Where's this come from, all of a sudden?
No, I can do anything. I'm just more worried about you.
Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for.
November the 7th?
The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. Are you sure about this?
Go to him, quick.
Right, that's the first you and me. It's a very bad idea, two sets of us being here at the same time. Just be careful they don't see us. Wait till she runs off and he follows, then go to your dad.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to, but this is the last time we can be here.
Rose! No!
When we met, I said travel with me in space. You said no. Then I said time machine.
I did it again. I picked another stupid ape. I should've known. It's not about showing you the universe. It never is. It's about the universe doing something for you.
I know what I'm doing, you don't. Two sets of us being there made that a vulnerable point.
My entire planet died. My whole family. Do you think it never occurred to me to go back and save them?
Rose, there's a man alive in the world who wasn't alive before. An ordinary man. That's the most important thing in creation. The whole world's different because he's alive.
I'm not saying that.
Let's see how you get on without me, then. Give me the key. The Tardis key. If I'm so insignificant, give it me back.
You've got what you wanted, so that's goodbye, then.
Rose!
Rose! Get in the church!
Get in the church!
Inside!
Stay in there!
In!
They can't get in. Old windows and doors. Okay. The older something is, the stronger it is. What else? Go and check the other doors! Move!
There's been an accident in time. A wound in time. They're like bacteria, taking advantage.
Oh, I might've known you'd argue. Jackie, I'm sick of you complaining.
I haven't got time for this.
No, and you never will unless I sort this out. Now, if you don't mind, I've waited a long time to say this. Jackie Tyler, do as I say. Go and check the doors.
I should have done that ages ago.
You can mourn him later. Right now we've got to concentrate on keeping ourselves alive.
There's nothing I can do for him.
That's the very first phone call. Alexander Graham Bell. I don't think the telephone's going to be much use.
Police can't help you now. No one can. Nothing in this universe can harm those things. Time's been damaged and they've come to sterilise the wound. By consuming everything inside.
It's not important. Don't worry about it.
Doctor.
I give that impression, yeah.
Who are you two, then?
And one extra. Boy or girl?
How did all this get started?
Then what? Asked her for a date?
Who said you're not important? I've travelled to all sorts of places, done things you couldn't even imagine, but you two. Street corner, two in the morning, getting a taxi home. I've never had a life like that. Yes. I'll try and save you.
Now, Rose you're not going to bring about the end of the world, are you? Are you?
Jackie gave her to me to look after. How times change.
No. Don't touch the baby. You're both the same person. That's a paradox, and we don't want a paradox happening, not with these things outside. Anything new, any disturbance in time makes them stronger. The paradox might let them in.
Since you ask, no. So, don't touch the baby.
You could have fooled me. All right, I'm sorry. I wasn't really going to leave you on your own.
But between you and me, I haven't got a plan. No idea. No way out.
The entire Earth's been sterilised. This, and other place like it, are all that's left of the human race. We might hold out for a while, but nothing can stop those creatures. They'll get through in the end. The walls aren't that old. And there's nothing I can do to stop them. There used to be laws stopping this kind of thing from happening. My people would have stopped this. But they're all gone. And now I'm going the same way.
Just tell me you're sorry.
It's the Tardis key!
It's telling me it's still connected to the Tardis.
The inside of my ship was thrown out of the wound but we can use this to bring it back. And once I've got my ship back, then I can mend everything. Now, I just need a bit of power. Has anybody got a battery?
Fantastic.
Just need to do a bit of charging up and then we can bring everyone back.
Right, no one touches that key. Have you got that? Don't touch it. Anyone touches that key, it'll be, well, zap. Just leave it be and everything will be fine. We'll get out of here. All of us. Stuart, Sarah you're going to get married, just like I said.
Everybody here forgets what happened. And don't worry, the thing that you changed will stay changed.
It doesn't work like that.
Rose! No!
Everyone, behind me! I'm the oldest thing in here.
Go to him. Quick.

I don't care if she is interested in them, I told her repeatedly not to go off on her own.
The Aztecs. They knew how to build.
Yes, I hope you're right. These Aztecs had some rather gruesome habits. I should hate to be carved up on that by some Aztec high priest.
Quickly!
Yes, you push from the other side. These tombs were designed to prevent grave robbers, not to aid and abet them.
The servants of whom, sir?
What is your name, sir?
And you are the High Priest?
You know where we came from?
Tell me, is there a way through from this side?
What's he talking about now?
You know who he is?
Exactly.
The Aztecs always showed the utmost courtesy towards their intended victims.
Good gracious.
Autloc.
Charming.
Reincarnations can come out, but human beings can't go in.
That's one thing you mustn't do. As Yetaxa, you're supposed to know everything. If the Aztecs decide you're not what you're supposed to be, then we shall all die.
As you said, Chesterton, the local butcher.
And Barbara will appear and down will come the rains.
O, Great Spirit, grant us this our wish, that we may be your eyes and ears among the people to do our best and serve in all our interests.
A wonderful performance, my dear. Congratulations. We now have everything we want, exactly.
Yes. You and Susan here in safety, and Ian and I outside finding out about the tomb.
Oh, I shouldn't mind them. They're far too bust timing their miracle.
Presenting Barbara to the public one second before it rains.
Surely that is for Yetaxa to decide?
Why are all these people here?
Poor old souls, they must be bored to tears doing nothing.
What about?
And what about her?
What did you say her name was?
Of course.
In spite of the drought, there's plenty of water for the flowers.
Thank you. Mmm, all the perfume of the gods. I find this place delightful. So restful.
A very apt description.
Topau?
Oh, he designed all this, did he?
Yes, one senses that immediately. Does he come here often?
Oh, I see, he's a gardener.
But you just said that he watches
Yes, I see. He's dead.
Please.
I would have liked to have met him. You knew him?
Ah, a builder.
Yes, still I suppose he knows much of his father's work. I find the temple here very fascinating.
My dear lady, I should be so grateful.
My dear Chesterton, this dear lady has promised me to arrange a meeting between myself and the son of the man who built the temple.
Charming person.
So intelligent and gentle.
Just a minute, what are you supposed to do?
Do it, man! Do it but don't interfere.
There's no buts about it. If human sacrifice is essential here and it's their tradition, then let them get on with it. But for our sakes, don't interfere. Now promise me, please. Promise. I'll go and tell Barbara.
Get out of my way. Go on. Let me pass. I must talk to Yetaxa.
Susan, please go outside and don't let anybody in.
There's to be a human sacrifice today at the Rain Ceremony.
And you must not interfere, do you understand?
No, Barbara! Ian agrees with me. He's got to escort the victim to the altar.
Yes, they've made him a warrior, and he's promised me not to interfere with the sacrifice.
Barbara, no!
Barbara, no.
What are you talking about?
But you can't rewrite history! Not one line!
Barbara, one last appeal. What you are trying to do is utterly impossible. I know, believe me, I know.
You must stay here, child. You must.
Well, young woman, I hope you're satisfied. A happy day for you.
You wouldn't be advised, would you. Oh, dear me, no, you knew better.
Do you think we felt any differently?
Then why not leave well alone? Human sacrifice is their tradition. Their religion. There's nothing we can do about it.
Yes, and what happened? Tlotoxl lost faith in you, our lives are in danger, and Susan is locked up in some kind of seminary.
Safe? Safe, my dear child? She was perfectly safe here until you started meddling.
Don't you realise he wanted to be offered to the gods? It made him feel one.
No, that's just it. You didn't think.
I'm sorry, my dear. I didn't mean to be so harsh with you.
However, what's done is done, and now it's up to you what happens next.
Yes, you'll have to hold Tlotoxl off.
No, not to Autloc.
Yes. The more Tlotoxl doubts you, the more you must convince Autloc that you are Yetaxa.
Exactly.
Oh well, Ian can look after himself, and I think I shall know more about the entrance to the tomb tonight. I've met somebody who knows how the temple was built. An Aztec lady.
Yes, but really it's up to you, Barbara. We're quite safe here as long as you're here. So
As Yetaxa commands.
What leaf is this?
I think I know about it.
No, no, they call me the Doctor. I am a scientist, an engineer. I'm a builder of things.
Yes, there are one or two features inside the temple that intrigue me.
Yes, for instance, the tomb is sealed. Now surely the builder had some way of opening it?
Yes, of course I don't wish to pry into family matters
Oh, my dear, how charming of you.
Oh, any time. Today?
Yes, and I'm sure that's true of you, too.
Oh, but their minds are old, Cameca, and that's something I'm sure yours will never be.
Yes, yes, indeed, I am.
Oh, indeed, yes. Well, I find the entrance to the High Priest's tomb a particularly fine piece of work.
Oh, yes, of course, yes, yes, he kept that secret, didn't he.
Really? I wonder if it's at all possible that I might see the drawings, hmm?
Oh, I don't see why not, hmm?
Oh, I hope not to the death?
Yes, I see.
And what weapons do you use?
Really? Indeed. Yes. Oh, dear, dear, dear, and I would have loved to have seen those drawings.
Yes, well, may I suggest that we assist each other?
Yes, I think a little horticulture might go a long way.
Yes, and make sure that you don't scratch yourself.
No, it won't kill. It'll slowly drain away the strength of your opponent. And scratch here.
Oh, and young man, you won't forget the drawings, hmm?
So shall I.
Barbara? Barbara!
What?
Nonsense. I'm supposed to be one of your servants.
All right, I'll go, but first, I think I shall know more about the entrance to the tomb tonight.
All I had to do was make certain some warrior won a fight.
I don't know. But he had a sort of mask or face like a cat.
Ixta? Ixta! I must warn Ian.
Sir, I will not have
I demand to be released. Take your hands off me, sir. How dare you! How dare you!
Ian, don't let him scratch you.
Tlotoxl, stop this nonsense. Stop it!
Ixta is using that magic I gave him.
Autloc, stop this!
I'm delighted.
Oh, go away, Tlotoxl.
Ixta cheated me.
I am faithful to my friends.
Not at all.
What is it you want from me?
Then open the tomb.
Then talk to Ixta. He has some drawings.
I serve the truth. Help me, Tlotoxl, and I promise you, you will find it.
Ah, my dear Cameca. How nice to see you again. The garden's been a lonely place without you.
I was merely passing the time until you arrived. Oh, this sign. I hadn't noticed it before.
Oh, really?
Oh, my dear. Cocoa beans?
What am excellent idea. A currency you can drink. Delicious.
Yes, my dear, of course.
Yes, I agree. A rare delight. We should take a cup together.
Yes, yes, quite. Now, give me some beans and I'll prepare them.
I do. I insist absolutely. As a token of my esteem.
Wait here, my dear. I'll be back.
Happy days, my dear.
Very prettily put, my dear.
Cameca.
From where?
Magnificent, my dear. Where did you get it?
In this garden?
And I with you, my dear.
Serenity.
Yes, why not? A garden of our won.
That came out of the tomb. And the man who discovered it later disappeared in the garden. And on the wall is a stone with Yetaxa's sign on it.
Yes, that's what I suspect.
My fiance.
Yes, I made some cocoa and got engaged. Don't giggle, my boy, It's neither here nor there. We must find that tunnel tonight.
Now, I'll wait for you in the garden, and when Ixta's asleep, you come out.
Ian. I can't move that an inch.
Good.
Yes. You stay guard.
Both of us.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Take that. You might need it. (a torch)
Oh, yes, a pleasant evening.
Yes, exactly. I was just about to do that.
Oh, dear, what a pity.
Oh, yes. Somebody must have moved it. I suppose they had a reason. I should leave it where it is.
What do you mean, ruined?
It's perfectly dry.
Open this, Ixta. Ixta, please. Please open it.
Ian Chesterton is in there.
Open it! Open it!
Barbara! Barbara! Something terrible, my dear. I just don't know how to tell you. Ian
My dear boy, I thought you were drowned.
Ixta.
Yes, of course he followed you. But never mind about that. How does that door work?
Is she still at that seminary?
Thank you. And watch out for that man Ixta.
Yes, it's bound to take him some time to get there and back.
Hmm, and the history?
No rewriting?
This isn't going to be easy, you know.
Yes, we can pull, but I think we'd better do it at an angle. What we really need is a pulley.
I know, but it isn't going to be easy.
My dear Susan. I'll tell you how glad I am to see you later on. Come along. Don't waste time.
Now, this is not going to be so easy as you think, young man.
Yes, well, be careful.
Cord's old. It might break. No, no, wait. Let's do it at an angle. Come along.
That's it, it's safer.
Right.
Yes.
Harder!
I think you're right.
Oh, now, now, now, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. Don't give up hope.
Ian didn't hit him, Cameca.
Yes, and as Ian has said, he was in the garden. I know, and he's innocent.
Yes. Butchered by Ixta.
Oh, just something to take my mind off the problems.
It isn't just Tlotoxl that we have to contend with. He and his kind will destroy all this one day.
It isn't the will of Yetaxa.
Yes, and Yetaxa speaks for them. But Autloc is needed here, and he won't go to the temple.
There you are, my dear, it's nearly finished.
Yes. I'm sorry, my dear.
For both of us.
He must do to safeguard his own beliefs.
You're a very fine woman, Cameca, and you'll always be very, very dear to me.
They're all busy at the ceremony and this is just the right time.
Yes, now let me see. Oh, I think you ought to order Autloc to release Susan and Ian.
Yes. It'll only take me a moment to open the doors and then we shall all dash through there and
Oh, my dear Susan.
She's in there.
That was a very brave thing for you to do, Cameca, but you can't stay here.
Go! Quickly!
Yes, we did. We had to.
Yes.
He found another faith, a better, and that's the good you've done. You failed to save a civilisation, but at least you helped one man.
We have a bit of a mystery, my boy.
My instruments.
Yes, and those instruments say that we're still moving.
Yes.

Ra, ra, rum, rum, da, ra! Ra, ra, da, dum, da ,dah. La Donna e mobile, ra, ra, ra, rum, da, dah. De, dah, da, rum, da, dah, bah ,de, da, dum, da, dah. Da, da, dah, rum, bum.
Hello, Brigadier. Making yourself at home?
Fine, thank you, fine.
Good heavens. Which one's you?
No, no, no, don't tell me. let me guess.
Not that one. Not that one. What, none of them?
(laughing) Yes, well, if it's true, I can see why you grew that moustache.
What do you mean?
Allow? Look, Miss Shaw may have the misfortune to work for you, Brigadier. I am a free agent.
What?
And do you know who did the killing?
Do you know anything about him?
Oh, it's still warm.
If the wrench had been subjected to intense energy, it might have disturbed its atomic make-up.
Well, it's a matter of great scientific interest, my dear fellow. First penetration of the Earth's crust. Well, naturally I'm interested.
Yes, well, I'd concentrate on finding that rigger if I was you. Well, excuse me, I must get back to work.
Yes, in a way. Some related experiments, you know.
Our liver playing us up again this morning, is it Professor?
Welcome to the Inferno, Mister Sutton.
Well, I think that certain people ought to pay a lot more attention to the warnings of this computer.
Yes. Mind you, I'm not wild about computers myself, but they are a tool. If you have a tool, it's stupid not to use it.
Power for my own little project. Nice to have met you, Mister Sutton.
Give that more lateral compensation, old chap, or you'll blow the main condenser banks. Cost thousands to put that right. Waste of valuable time and money. Hmm? (The Doctor leaves and Stahlman goes over to the terminal to check.)
Good morning. Any sign of Slocum yet?
Nasty business that.
Funny gadgets?
It's only a door handle.
Any progress?
Good.
Yes, but I think you'll find they only confirm what we already know.
Oh, the usual friction between Sir Keith and Stahlman.
There's been a murder, Liz.
It's a dreadful business, a murder without a motive. Right, let's get back to work, shall we?
Indeed I am. That's why we came here.
Look, Liz. Look, without the Tardis I feel rather lost. A stranger in a foreign land. A shipwrecked mariner.
In a minute.
Right, we've been over this many times. You know exactly what to do, don't you?
Well then, take up your position and I'll switch the nuclear power through.
Liz! Please.
All right?
Now, at my signal, give me first stage power and then full boost a fraction later.
I'll think of something. I hope.
Right. Stand by, Liz.
Switch to first stage power. Full boost, Liz.
Too much power, Liz! Too much power.
Yes. I still feel dizzy. I seem to be in one piece anyway.
I'm not sure. I seemed to be in some sort of limbo. There was a barrier I couldn't break through. We must make another trial run.
Because of all that. I wonder where I was exactly? Where I was going?
Well, next time we must ensure that I do.
There's been a nuclear power surge. Actually, we experienced it ourselves earlier. It must have gone quite mad at the reactor.
Where was the body found?
Anywhere near the reactor?
Professor? We think we know what's wrong.
Well, I'm afraid I was wrong, Professor.
It's not so much your liver as your general disposition. Brigadier, come on.
Look.
No, don't move. It'll only antagonise him.
Look, there's nothing to be frightened of, old chap.
Pistol. Pistol!
No, no. Don't touch him. Look at that wall. It's scorched.
Hello? Oh, it's you, Stahlman. Thank you, we've dealt with the matter ourselves.
Both bullets right through the heart.
Abnormal resistance, abnormal strength. That's not all.
Look, they'd better not touch the body for a while. It's radiating a good deal of heat.
Heat, Brigadier. Like the wrench that killed that technician. Like that switch over there.
There don't seem to be any major injuries.
Possibly. I don't know.
Mmm?
Some sort of retrogression of the body cells, I think.
Neither do I. Not fully, not yet.
Yes. The process was relatively slow and it wasn't completed.
Why wasn't the metamorphosis completed?
I have.
Krakatoa, the Sundra Straits. During the volcanic eruption of 1883.
There could be.
Wyatt?
Wait!
Now Wyatt, listen to me. You need help.
Don't touch him! Whatever you do, don't touch him!
Hello? What have we got here?
Well, I doubt whether it will cool down.
I was just venturing an opinion.
Krakatoa, actually.
I wish I could hear it, Liz.
I wonder if it screeches?
Why? Something interesting?
A question.
Isn't anybody going to pay any attention to that computer out there?
You talk about the thing as though it was your maiden Aunt.
Yes, well I'll tell you something that should be of vital interest to you, Professor.
That you, sir, are a nitwit!
No, Professor, don't.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have done that if I was you.
I hope so, because its message is perfectly clear.
Come and see for yourself. It warns that drilling should be stopped immediately. Well, look at it, man. Are you blind?
You please yourself, sir. I've done the best I can to convince you. I may as well get back to my own work.
Oh? Why not? STAHLMAN: We need all the energy we can get. I propose to accelerate the drilling by twelve percent. Cut the power to the Doctor's hut. Not to be reconnected under any circumstances.
That's an incredibly childish attitude to take.
So am I, Sir Keith.
Liz? Go and check the tri-gamma circuits on the console again, will you?
Look, please, don't ask any questions. There's a good girl.
Professor! What are you doing with that micro-circuit?
That computer is a threat to you, isn't it? It could prove you wrong. Now give me that micro-circuit.
Ai tavich!
Venusian karate. It's very effective. Hold it long enough and the subject remains permanently paralysed.
Oh, very well.
Shall I tell him or will you?
Look, don't you start asking me questions. Just keep your eyes open and follow me.
Professor, there are some questions that we would like to ask you.
Would you mind telling us what you have in your left hand pocket?
I tell you he had a micro-circuit in his pocket.
Yes. Well, I suppose I've got something better to do with my time anyway.
You see, it's packing up already.
Did you find any damage to the main circuits?
Did you replace them?
Good, good.
Oh, just a little contretemps between myself and Stahlman. Nothing of any importance.
Oh, I don't think so.
Liz, it wasn't the console that was to blame. It was that nuclear power surge.
Yeah. Would you do me a favour?
Nip down to the control centre, will you, and feed these figures into the spare bank of the computer. They're some epsilon coordinates.
Yes, I know, but I'm a bit tired.
Hmm? Oh, I'm so sorry.
Unity is strength? Who's been messing about with my equipment?
What the blazes do you think you're doing?
Liz? Liz, it's me. Don't you recognise me? What's happened to everyone round here? Have you all gone mad? What are you doing in that ridiculous get-up?
All right, Liz, a joke's a joke.
Liz, this is ridiculous!
Brigadier, will you kindly tell me what on
What on Earth are you doing in that get-up?
I beg your pardon?
Look, your name is Lethbridge Stewart?
Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart?
All right, Brigade Leader. Have it your own way. And you are Elizabeth Shaw.
What are you talking about?
My name? You ask me my name after all the years that you and I. Well now, wait a minute. Yes, I think I'm beginning to see what's happened here. Might I suggest you just call me Doctor?
Smith. Doctor John Smith.
Yes, well, this is where we come to the difficult bit.
I come from a parallel space-time continuum.
Yes, well, let me put it this way. I've been transported from another world. One that is running almost parallel to this one.
Now, now look, wait. You are Elizabeth Shaw.
Not a scientist?
Oh. This is fascinating. So many similarities, yet so many differences.
Tell me, how far down is the shaft that you are drilling?
And Professor Stahlman? Is his liver still playing him up? And Sir Keith? How is Sir Keith? Yes, now there's a man who might understand.
Only that he's the Executive Director of this project. Yes, I should very much like to see him.
Indeed, I would. Failing that, Professor Stahlman. He's an opinionated oaf, I know, but at least he's a scientist.
Wait a minute.
Three hours twenty two minutes? You're a lot more advanced with the drilling here.
Difficult why?
Sir Keith dead?
Yes, to complain about you, no doubt.
Excuse me, but what about this computer?
Yes, it doesn't seem to be working.
Yeah, missing micro-circuit, do you think, Professor?
Look, may I ask what is going to happen to me?
Without a trial?
Well, look, you can't possibly have the authority to do a thing like
Republic?
Then what's happened to the Royal
Pity. A charming family. I knew her great grandfather in Paris. Do you know, I remember on one occasion
Look, I've been standing here for quite some time.
Why is this place crawling with you oafs in uniform?
Staffed by slave labour, I take it? Well, you're all in very grave danger.
Before that computer broke down, it was transmitting danger signals, was it not?
And what about Harry Slocum?
Only that he went berserk and started killing people.
Look, I am not a spy. I've seen it all before.
In another world.
You're just wasting time.
But I don't exist in your world!
I'm delighted to hear that.
Proper little bureaucrat, aren't you? Can't shoot me unless you've filled in all the forms, is that it?
My dear young lady, if that computer was functioning, it would warn us that we all have very little time left!
Tell me, have you ever seen anything like this before?
Come on, come on, where are you?
Trying to find a particular micro-circuit. I may be able to repair your computer for you.
You idiot! If I don't repair this computer, you'll all be blown
Thank you, Section Leader.
Nevertheless, thank you, just the same. Oh, incidentally, I think I may be able to repair your computer for you.
I should say it was everybody's concern.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think this might be it.
Hang on, just a moment.
You see? The computer's already aware of the situation and is assessing its immediate problems.
I was not sabotaging it. I was repairing it.
Yes. The pressures and the heat are overwhelming the present velocity of the drill head.
Well, you can disperse the heat and the pressure.
By creating a reverse vortex at the bottom of the shaft.
Reversing all the systems.
Now look, you two are just wasting time. What I suggest is this. We push all the coolant down the output pipe and then draw up all the debris from the bottom of the shaft through the inlet pipe.
Of all the ungrateful nitwits!
Enough.
Of sorts, yes.
I've already told you. I come from a parallel space-time continuum. A twin world of this.
Your counterpart in the other world would tell you that I'm not in the habit of telling lies, Elizabeth.
It's not that she looks like you, she is you. I do wish I could make you understand this.
Do? She's a scientist.
Did you ever think of becoming a scientist? Yes. Yes, I can see that you did.
Simply that her mind process runs along a similar parallel to yours. Doesn't that strike you as significant?
Look, Elizabeth, please try and think. Whatever they taught you in this bigoted world of yours, you've still got a mind of your own. Now use it, before it's too late!
Good. I'm very glad to hear it.
Maybe you'll give me a medal. Posthumously.
No, not particularly. Do you?
Elizabeth, I am trying to help you! You said the emergency was over. Well, it isn't. As long as you people go on drilling, you're rushing into terrible danger!
You're wasting your time, you know. I can stand a great deal of this childishness.
Yes, I'm sure you have. But it won't do you any good.
How can I give you information that doesn't exist?
I came here on my own. I came by accident. I came here. The Tardis console slipped me sideways in time. Slipped me sideways in time.
That Stahlman. He's accelerating the drilling.
I see you're wearing white cotton gloves, Director. May we ask why?
Brigade Leader, ask him to take off his left glove. I think you'll find it very interesting.
Why the bandages, professor?
You touched some of that green substance, from that cracked jar, didn't you? Just a little, but it's enough to infect you.
Listen to me. You're seriously ill. You've been infected.
Listen to me, Stahlman, for God's sake.
Please, don't push. I'll have you know that your counterpart in the other world was a nice, sociable sort of chap, Sergeant.
That's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
Ah, I see I've got company. And what did he do, park in a restricted zone?
At least he seems to be sleeping peacefully.
What about some food? A cup of tea? Some cocoa? A glass of water then?
Ah. Visiting time already, is it?
Oh yes, it is.
Ah, go away and give me some peace.
Oh well, that's different. Anything for a quiet life.
Look, I am sick and tired of answering all these idiot questions.
I have answered them! More times than I care to remember.
I've told you the truth. If your minds are too narrow to accept it, that's not my fault.
Trying a change of technique?
First you try to bully me, and then you switch on the charm. Secret police routine seven stroke four.
Even though I'm a spy?
Oh, no!
Look, I am not mad, I am not a spy and I'm certainly not a political demonstrator. You just won't listen, will you?
Your counterpart had some intelligence. I wish I could say the same for you.
Hello, old chap. How are you doing? Been down here long, have you? Read any good police records lately? The friendliness of this establishment overwhelms me.
Sergeant. Sergeant! Sergeant!
This man is sick. He needs medical attention.
You must stop this countdown before it's too late!
Do you hear me? You must stop it!
If you break through the Earth's crust now, you'll release forces you never dreamed could exist!
Listen to that!
That's the sound of this planet screaming out its rage!
You're not thinking of going in there, are you?
There's never been a bore like this one.
Somehow, I don't think he feels the heat as we do.
Well, here goes.
A piece of pipe held by Stahlman.
Yes.
I think he likes it in there.
Yes, not to mention those technicians.
Very little now, I'm afraid. Tell me Mister Sutton, how thick are those walls?
Compared to the forces that you people have unleashed, an atomic blast would be like a summer breeze.
What's going on out there?
Yes, well, they'll be no better off in the long run, wherever they go.
Well, the heat will have fused the main circuits. I'll have a look.
Yes?
Too late, Mister Sutton. You've unleashed the energies of the Earth's core.
No substance on this Earth is strong enough to withstand those pressures.
Well, the heat and the pressures'll continue to build up until the Earth dissolves in a fury of expanding gasses, just as it was billions of years ago.
Maybe a few weeks, maybe only a few days.
Don't go near him, Brigadier! Don't go near him. He's probably more interested in getting to the drill head than he is in us.
Oh. He seems to be dead this time.
It wasn't just your bullets that killed him, you know.
Yes, the fire extinguisher. They can't stand cold.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Gentlemen, stop arguing. Just save your energy.
You could help me to save a world, you know.
Not this one, Elizabeth. The other one.
This other world exists, Brigade Leader. It's as true as the one you know yourselves.
Yes. You, the Brigade Leader, Stahlman, Sutton, Petra, all of you. You could save your other selves.
With the aid of the Tardis.
Yes.
Yes, possibly. If I could use your nuclear reactor for power.
Not necessarily. Work on their project is not so advanced as yours. I may be able to stop them before they penetrate the Earth's crust.
That's right.
No, but she's a very important part of one.
Back in the world where I came from. I, er, I removed the console to make some trial runs.
There's always a certain amount of energy left in the storage unit.
You said you were going to help me.
If you'd only try and use the little intelligence you have.
Proof? Demonstration? What do you think I am, a conjuror? Have can I give you a demonstration when I haven't got. Now, wait a minute.
If I'm to do it, I'll drain the storage unit completely. Very well, you shall have your demonstration.
Well, are you satisfied? Or do you think it was all done with mirrors?
Just a pitiful few seconds into the future. I only wish it could have been more.
Don't be a fool, man. I can't possibly go anywhere. The storage unit is completely flat.
Perhaps.
No! No, I couldn't possibly do that.
It would create a dimensional paradox. It would shatter the space-time continuum of all universes.
You mustn't!
No! Whatever you do, don't raise that heat shield.
No! Don't go anywhere near him. Don't go near him.
They're acclimatising themselves. They don't want to get too far away from the heat.
We'll make a break for your office.
Into the office!
Leave him be! There's nothing you can do! Come on, hurry!
Believe me, Mister Sutton, there was nothing we could have done.
Worse than that, he'll have become one of them. The heat will accelerate the process.
To keep them away from the heat. The hotter it is, the stronger they grow.
Not necessarily. I do have a plan for getting us out, but it all depends on those creatures out there.
No, no! No, don't touch it.
I don't think they'll be back for a while. They'll wait till the temperature rises.
I should say all of ten minutes.
Well, if we're going to get power to the Tardis console, we'll have to connect it up to the nuclear reactor.
Well, the air conditioning's still working, so power's still getting through.
Can you boost the output?
But it can be re-set?
Well, we've still got a weapon to use against them.
No, I don't. I mean the fire extinguisher.
Well, there are other fire extinguishers in Central Control.
Splendid. Well, we'll fight our way into Central Control using this. While Mister Sutton holds them off with his coolant, I'll repair the master switch.
Right. Now!
Well, stop talking so much.
That's enough. Don't waste it! That's enough, I said! It's Stahlman!
No, I think he's just paralysed. He'll probably come to again when the temperature rises.
Right.
Right, off you go!
Don't worry about me. I'll stay and repair the master switch.
The heat's made a pretty good mess of this.
You can always join the others outside, you know, Mister Sutton.
Are they now?
Slow but sure, Mister Sutton.
Mmm hmm?
If I get back.
I don't know. Maybe somebody will listen to me there. Sir Keith, for instance?
Here, perhaps. In the other world, maybe not.
That's it. I only hope it works. Shall we go, Mister Sutton?
Hurry along, my dear fellow. Hurry along!
Now, Mister Sutton and I had better start work on the power connection. Will you be long, Doctor Williams?
Be as quick as you can.
Well, you'd better wait here.
No, I'm afraid not. Now, I'll need some tools and a length of heavy duty cable.
Right, come on, let's get on with it.
Right, come on!
The console, Mister Sutton, the console.
What did you expect? Some kind of space rocket with Batman at the controls?
Er, well, it wasn't exactly a journey in the accepted sense of the word. It sort of slipped me sideways into your dimension.
Theoretically, yes.
I hope so. Now fix the connector to the cable, will you?
A few seconds are all I need, Mister Sutton.
Right. You can connect up the cable now.
We're not relying on luck, Mister Sutton, but skill.
You must try and be patient.
Yes, I know.
Well, that appears to be that. I doubt whether they would have listened to me anyway.
What's the matter?
Yes, of course you did, my dear.
One can't do more than that, Mister Sutton.
Hysteria won't help us, Brigade Leader.
Listen to that! Do you want to end your lives fighting like animals?
I'll come with you.
It's coming through all right, and it's gaining rapidly.
Well done, Doctor Williams!
I can't. It's impossible.
I can't. I literally can't! It'd create a cosmic disaster.
Do you think I want to? I'd give anything to save you all.
You'll have to shoot me, Brigade Leader. I have no intention of taking you.
I can't! It's still too erratic!
Number two. Number two output pipe blown.
Number two output pipe.
Very dangerous. Very dangerous. Number two output pipe blown.
There's only one thing, one thing to do. Reverse, reverse all systems. Reverse all systems immediately.
Reverse all systems!
Yes.
(waking) Liz? It is Liz.
Fine, Brigadier. You know, you really do look better with that moustache.
Yes, I'm very well aware of that. Oh, the pulse seems to be more or less normal, at a hundred and seventy. Yeah. Yes, both ticking away quite nicely. Although the right one seems a fraction faster. Still that's only to be expected, isn't it?
Same time, same place, only a different dimension. It was a parallel world, Liz. Terrible things are happening there. Terrible things. It wasn't this Earth, and yet it was. I didn't go backwards into the past, or forwards into the future. I slipped sideways.
Brigade Leader, that technician, the one who went berserk and started killing people, have you found him yet?
And Stahlman, how's he?
But no worse?
How's the drilling?
Sir Keith!
So you're not dead?
But you're not dead.
That's excellent! Excellent!
So not everything runs parallel.
Yes, of course, of course. An infinity of universes, ergo an infinite number of choices. So free will is not an illusion after all. The pattern can be changed.
Now look.
Now, wait a minute. I'm not sick, I'm not in need of a doctor and I'm not a raving idiot!
Sir Keith, unless we do something very, very quickly indeed, there's going to be a disaster.
Because I've already seen it.
Professor Stahlman? You must stop this drilling immediately!
Do you hear me? Close down this operation now!
Now listen to me, all of you! You are not to attempt to penetrate the Earth's crust!
Get out of my light! Now stop this drilling!
Stop this drilling! You don't understand, do you?
You've got stop this drilling!
Stop this drilling!
Now Liz, listen to me. Computer. There's a micro circuit missing.
Stop it! Stop this drilling!
Well, I'm sorry about this, gentlemen.
Where's Stahlman?
Good. Then stop this infernal drilling. Well, what are you waiting for?!
Stop this drilling and start filling up that shaft!
Stahlman, get back! Sutton, the fire extinguishers!
Fire extinguishers!
Petra, the drill. Close it down.
Hurry, hurry!
That's the buffer controls at the drill head. Come on!
I can only try.
Sir Keith, I think you'd better give orders for that shaft to be filled in straight away.
Shine on Martian moons, up in the sky. Join in. Liz, come on.
Shine on, shine on, Martian moon.
Oh, are you leaving, Sir Keith?
Well, I'm not sorry to hear that. What about the nuclear reactor?
Oh, but there's time for me to use it just once more, I hope?
Thank you, Sir Keith. By the way, how's Sutton and Miss Williams?
Nothing like a nice happy ending, is there?
Goodbye, Sir Keith.
Goodbye, Brigadier.
Oh, pity. Well, come on, Liz. If we've going to link up to that nuclear reactor, we'd better get a move on.
The trouble it's caused you?
And a fat lot of notice you all took.
Brigadier, there are times when you strongly remind me of your other self. I shall leave at once.
Naturally.
With the work that we did today, the Tardis console is now fully operational.
Goodbye, Liz. I shall miss you, my dear. But I've had about all I can stand of this pompous, self-opinionated idiot here.
A few seconds forward in time, and a few hundred yards due east in space.
The rubbish tip.
Er, Brigadier, my dear fellow, I wonder whether I could borrow a couple of your stalwart chaps to give me a hand in bringing the Tardis back? It's landed in rather an inaccessible position.
Yes, well we don't want to bear a grudge for a few hasty words, do we? No, not after all the years that we've worked together. Now come long, my dear fellow, put on a smile. Just remember all

Paranoia.
Night-time setting. Faulty filament. Three-day week.
Yeah. This close into the planet, they must have some pretty powerful anti-grav shielding on board.
People never do that, you know?
They never put the wordspace in front of something just because everything's all sort of hi-tech and future-y. It's neverspace restaurant or space champagne orspace, you know, hat. It's justrestaurant,champagne orhat.
Even if this was a restaurant
Pedant.
Hello.
Yes. Yes, we are.
We're here to, er.
Stress.
From the beginning of time? That's a very long story.
Well. Well, we just arrived, you know, and there was nobody about. What are you doing here?
Theories?
So, what, you are a rescue mission?
Of four?
(sings)  Part of the furniture! 
Okay. Really?
(sotto) Okay.
Indo-Japanese.
Thirty eighth century. (tastes his finger again.) Tuesday.
Hmm. After the Great Catastrophe, there was a tectonic realignment. India and Japan, they were sort of merged.
Well, you've got all that to look forward to, haven't you? Mind you, this place looks as if it's been dead for a long while now.
What is it?
She's a Grunt, Clara. They're bred in hatcheries. Cloned muscles. Low intelligence. Brute force. Instant army.
Well, that's how they roll in the thirty eighth century.
(sotto) Hold my hand.
I'm not.
Oh, run, run, run! Run! Run!
Quick! Push anything in front of it! We've got to keep them out!
Not pirates.
Where's your friend?
Finding out what they're made of.
Organic. Definitely organic. Blood cells. Skin cells. Mucus.
I could take a look at that. You know, triangulate the signal, help you find your friend.
Clara!
Clara!
What did you think you were doing?
Are you okay?
Semi-sentient. It thinks it knows what's good for you. You obviously needed forty winks. Clever little sleep pod. You said it was something more than that, though.
(to camera) Well, let's just say, for the sake of argument, that we don't. What is Morpheus?
Oh, no. No, no. enough of that.
It's almost like someone's
Sleep-deprivation pods?
But sleep is
Sleep is vital. Sleep is wonderful. Even
Well, when you're not looking.
So, how does it work?
Are they now?Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care. The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath. Balm of hurt minds, chief nourisher in life's great feast. Congratulations, Professor. You've revolutionised the labour market. You've conquered nature.
You've also created an abomination.
Sleep dust.
Well do I look like I'm kidding? Is this a kidding face? Ask the crew of this station if they're kidding. Or what's left of them.
Yes. The stuff in the corner of your eye. The stuff you wipe away every morning when you wake up.
Well, when we sleep, the mucus crust builds up in our eyes. Blood cells, skin cells. That's what dust largely is. Human skin. But your meddling has evolved it. Hot-housed it. What used to be sleep in your eye has turned into a carnivorous life form.
Lying there in those pods, people are a ready-made food source.
Digested.
Well, my guess is that the ones you're using are pretty primitive compared to what's going on up here. These are a sort of a Mark Two, yeah?
You've succeeded there.
You saw what happened. The dust conglomerates and moulds itself intohumanoid form. It's adaptable. It's clever.
And it's coming for us.
No. We can't leave this place until there's not a trace of the dust or your machines left. Or that's it for your lot.
Oh, the human race.
Nagata! That thing, the schematic. Give it to me!
Me? I'm in charge.
No, but I'm in charge. I can bypass the main systems and reboot the grav-shields!
Don't say it. Please don't say it!
Hang on!
I can do this! I can fix this!
The G-force is increasing the closer we get to the planet! Hold on!
We're back online! Grav-shields fixed! We're rising! Go. let's get out of here! Go, go! Out of here. Come on!
Keep going, move it, move it, move it!
Nagata!
I don't know.
Don't be ridiculous.
To die? They wouldn't thank you for that. Nor you, Clara. To die, to die. Glamis hath murdered sleep, therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more.
Shakespeare. He really knew his stuff. They all did. The Ancients. The poets. All those sad songs. All those lullabies. Sleep is essential to every sentient being in the universe. But to humans. Greedy, filthy, stupid humans. It's an inconvenience to be bartered away. Well, now we know the truth. Sleep isn't just a function. It's blessed. Every night we dive deep into that inky pool, deep into the arms of Morpheus. Every morning, we wake up and wipe the sleep from our eyes, and that keeps us safe. Safe from the monsters inside.
I've hacked into your helmet cams.
Reviewing the footage. There's something not right here.
Why did it kill Rassmussen like that?
But that's a direct attack. That's not how they operate. Dust grows. Consumes the host.
Maybe. There's something going on here. Something we're not getting.
Sandmen?
No, you don't get to name things. I'm the Doctor. I do the naming.
It's like the Silurians all over again.
Sandmen. (to Nagata) What did you just say?
One point eight three minutes ago.
We let them in.
We let them in.
Run! Engine room!
You said you felt like you were being watched, Clara.
Not this time.
There is a feed. Wireless. These images are being stored by someone. Collated. Nagata, look at this footage. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it?
Look, there's one very obvious thing about it. Do you see it yet? No? Okay, I'll tell you what's wrong. There's footage here of everyone. But what's missing in all of it? What can't you see anywhere? Not in the footage, not on this ship. Look. Really look. There are no cameras here. No CCTV. No helmet cams. So, how and why does this footage even exist? The dust has been watching us. Each little organic speck, just a tiny spy drifting through the air. The monsters have been with us all along. That's why the Sandmen are blind. Their visual receptors are being hijacked. But by whom, and why? And then, there's this.
That's you, Clara. That's you, looking at me.
You went into the pod. The Morpheus process has begun.
There's nothing here from Chopra's point of view because he refuses to use Morpheus. But everybody else is here. Including you. You don't have a camera, Clara. But you will have by now, sleep in your eye.
Yes. I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm sure you'll be fine.
We will sort this, Clara. We'll sort you. We'll sort Nagata, and everyone back on Triton. And then we will destroy Morpheus forever.
Well, there was that incident with the grav-shields, but. Ah.
The grav-shields didn't fail. They were deliberately powered down.
Well, that's not their style, is it?
It's like, it's like something's been kept here, near the engines, where it's hot. Like something's being kept alive.
Yeah.
I have an idea who. A very nasty idea.
Because that's where he'll be.
You had that prepared well in advance, didn't you? Your statement. Your alibi. There would inevitably be questions when you got to Triton. So, you needed to get your story straight.
I think the Professor has been playing a long game. Am I right?
You and your cargo.
It's like smuggling a jam jar full of germs through customs.
What do you mean?
Or what's left of him.
You know I can't allow that.
What he wants is to get that thing off this ship. We have to stop him.
The doors are not a problem.
We need a distraction.
When I sayrun, run.
Hey! Sandy!
Run!
Doors!
Rassmussen! Turn off the engines. Shut this ship down!
No!
He's not the only one dead. According to this data, we're the only ones left alive on this station.
This doesn't make any sense.
A man who hasn't slept for five years?
But the dust consumes the host.
We escaped from that cold storage room because they were blind. And why power down the grav-shields when he did? It's like this is all for effect.
Like a story.
Alternative transport.
We have to get to Triton,destroy all the Morpheus machines. End this. This is how we get home?
Nagata!
Self-destructed the grav-shields.
It's working!
Neptune's gravity is pulling them apart, bit by bit! It doesn't make sense. None of this makes any sense.

The Panopticon.
No! No!
Right outside the Capitol itself. I'm in trouble now.
The Chancery guards. Pft. What a welcome home.
Obsolete? Twaddle. Take no notice, my dear old thing.
Presidential Resignation Day!
I must get past them and warn the President.
Cash and carry, Constantinople.
Hey, just a minute! Excuse me!
Now, where's the local news programme? Ah.
Oh no, it's Runcible. Runcible the Fatuous.
Oh, get off.
What a way to travel. But which way the Panopticon?
Here you are, sir.
Runcible, my dear chap. How nice to see you.
Oh, it's all been forgotten about now, old boy.
Oh, here and there, you know. Round and about.
Oh no, just a twinge in the knee.
Several, so far.
Yes, and splendidly too, if I may say so.
Oh, it's a gift. Somehow you have a wonderful way of making the whole thing come alive.
What? Yes.
What?
No!
Let me go! Let me go!
Extraordinary. The roof's still on. I could have sworn it fell on me.
No, no, wait, wait, I
All right. All right, I'll confess.
I confess you're a bigger idiot than I thought you were. Argh.
I've got nothing to say.
Tweedledum.
Tweedledee.
I see. The hot and cold technique.
I'd like to help you. How about a signed confession?
Now that's a sensible question. Why should anyone want to assassinate a retiring President?
I never met him.
And you still think I did it?
What? Well, that's monstrous. Vaporisation without representation is against the constitution.
You realise I've been framed, don't you.
Yes, framed. It's an Earth expression. It means that someone's gone to a great deal of trouble to get me into this mess.
To try and save the President's life. If you remember, I left a note for you.
Which, presumably, you did nothing about.
Yes. In a way, I experienced it.
Well, this is the bit you won't believe. People talk of a premonition of tragedy, but I actually saw it happening. I saw the President die as vividly, as clearly as I can see this room now.
In the Tardis, travelling in vortex, after I'd heard the Panopticon summons.
Yes. Article Seventeen.
I offer myself as a candidate for the Presidency.
No, sir. I invoke Article Seventeen of the Constitution which is a guarantee of liberty and says, in part, that no candidate for office shall in anyway be debarred or restrained from presenting his claim.
No, sir, I am claiming a legal right.
Well, it's better than three.
Suppose, suppose I can convince you I didn't do it?
I just wanted to check it was the same staser. You see that symbol at the end of the corridor?
You try and hit it.
Go on. You try and hit it.
The sights. So you see, I couldn't have shot the President if I tried. And equally, I couldn't hit the assassin. That's why they were fixed.
Yes. Yes, he was in the party surrounding the President. I saw him draw a staser and step forward. I aimed a bolt at him, but at that time I didn't know the sights had been fixed.
What is?
I'll tell you where the evidence is.
In the Public Register camera. I was standing right beside it.
About there.
Yes.
Is that it?
Well, at least he's alive.
Matter condensation. A particularly nasty sort of death.
I have, I'm afraid.
Yes. It's a technique the Master picked up somewhere on his travels.
Who is the Master? He's my sworn arch-enemy. A fiend who glories in chaos and destruction.
Yes, a long time ago. You know, a lot of things are becoming clearer.
If the Master is here on Gallifrey, then this represents the final challenge. It explains why I was brought here. There are old scores to settle. And that's just a sort of greetings card.
It cannot be avoided. Like it or not, Gallifrey is involved, and I'm afraid things will never be quite the same again. Shall we go down?
Mmm, perhaps, perhaps.
Flea-bitings, Spandrell, flea-bitings. Things will get a lot worse.
Well, it might rouse some of them from their lethargy. They live for centuries and have about as much sense of adventure as dormice.
I told you so. If there had been a DE on the Master, the first thing he would have done would be to destroy it.
Rubbish. Anyone with a little criminal know-how could do it. I could do it myself.
Child's play to the Master. Do you think this stuff is sophisticated? There are worlds out there where this kind of equipment would be considered prehistoric junk.
He's brilliant, absolutely brilliant. He's almost up to my standard. What's that?
APC?
Brain cells.
Shush. I understand the theory. What's the function?
Ah. Like the assassination of a President.
Oh yes, it was foreseen, Engin. It was foreseen by me. How very clever. This time he's surpassed himself.
Well, don't you see what he's done? We Time Lords are telepathic. That's simply a brain storage system. He intercepted its forecast that the President was to be assassinated and beamed it into my mind.
Yes, yes. He could do it. You said my DE had been scanned.
Yes. He'd need a biography print to beam a message accurately over that distance. It makes sense, Spandrell.
I told you. Because he has an old score to settle.
By going in there and joining it.
Well, in a sense that's all a living mind is, electrochemical impulses. If I went in there, I could discover where he intercepted the circuit.
I'm aware of that.
Well, it's better than being vaporised, and that's what's in store for me if I don't produce the Master.
Is this what happens to the near-deceased?
I'm ready when you are.
Get on with it.
It's an illusion. Dreams.
I deny this reality. The reality is a computation matrix.
I deny it. I deny it!
All right, I'll fight you in your reality.
No anti-tank gun.
I wonder what he's been up to?
It didn't get him. If it had, this nightmare would have ended.
So that's what he was up to.
Must keep going. I must keep going.
Marsh gas.
What do you want of me?
I'll make a bargain with you.
No. You show yourself first. Your real self.
Goth. All right, Goth, you win.
Do you mind? This is a non-smoking compartment.
What?
Tired.
You should see the other fellow. Where is he, by the way?
Goth.
Yes. The Master's legman. He's the assassin, Spandrell.
Yes. Yes. That's right.
It was Goth, remember, who ordered my Tardis to be transducted into the Capitol. He knew I was still inside it. Goth must have his own link with the Matrix. A tap-in. We've got to trace it back to him before he recovers. What's underneath here?
Is that all?
Come on, come on. Show me.
The Master.
Yes.
Goth. Goth, why did you do it?
But you would have been.
What was his plan, Goth?
Goth? Goth, what was his plan?
Goth, what was
No answer to a straight question. Typical politician.
No what, Cardinal?
How kind.
Somehow, Cardinal, I don't want to stay.
We've bumped into each other from time to time.
Like Time Lord history.
Only in mathematics will we find truth.
Borusa used to say that during my time at the Academy, and now he's setting out to prove it.
Bad.
Yes. He was evil, cunning and resourceful. Highly developed powers of ESP and a formidable hypnotist. And the more I think about it, the less likely it seems.
Well, that the Master would meekly accept the end of his regeneration cycle. It's not his style at all.
Thank you. Not the Master. No, he had some sort of plan. That's why he came here, Engin.
He had a plan. Something to do with Goth becoming the President. What's so special about the President, Engin?
Symbols.
Tell me about Rassilon.
Could we hear that?
Oh!
Engin, I can feel my hair curling, and that means either it's going to rain or else I'm on to something.
Yes, that's all very interesting. Could we hear the transgram?
Must be a black hole.
Shush.
What's the Great Key?
Where's it kept?
And the Sash of Rassilon, where's that?
Of course. What a stupendous egotist.
The Master. He'd have destroyed Gallifrey, the Time Lords, everything, just for the sake of his own survival.
What?
Tricophenyladehyde.
No. It's a neural inhibitor. Spandrell, we've been fooled.
The Master, he's still alive.
The Master's consumed with hatred. It's his one great weakness.
Not in your case. You'd delay an execution to pull the wings off a fly.
Don't do it, Engin.
Don't give him the Sash, Engin.
Why have you brought me here?
The Sash. Where's the Sash?
What?
Engin, that Sash is a technological masterpiece. It protects its wearer from being sucked into a parallel universe. All he needs now is the Great Key and he can regenerate himself and release a force that'll obliterate this entire stellar system.
Well of course I mean it. Don't you realise what Rassilon did? What the Eye of Harmony is? Remember? That which balances all things. It can only be the nucleus of a black hole.
A myth? Spandrell, all the power of the Time Lords devolves from it. Neither flux nor wither nor change their state. Rassilon stabilised all the elements of a black hole and set them in an eternally dynamic equation against the mass of the planet. If the Master interferes, it'll be the end not only of this world, but of a hundred other worlds too.
You're right, but we've got to get out of this place.
There's a light up there. Where does that lead, Spandrell?
Right.
Oh, come on, come on, give us a bunk up.
You're insane. You're insane, do you hear me? You're releasing a force that nothing can stop.
If you undo that, you'll die as surely as any of us.
Yes, and the President was wearing it when he was shot down. The Sash won't protect you. It's damaged.
Well, you'll just have to adjust the truth again, Cardinal. What about subsidence owing to a plague of mice?
Yes, sir. You said that many times, sir. May I go, sir?
Sir?
Oh. Thank you, sir.
But I like it out there, thank you very much.
Thank you, Spandrell.
Well, I didn't actually see him fall, you know. I was quite busy.
There was a good deal of power coming out of that monolith, and the Sash would have helped him to convert it.
No, no, I hope not, Spandrell. And there's no one in all the galaxies I'd say that about. The quintessence of evil. Goodbye, Spandrell.
Oh, goodbye, Engin, goodbye.

No.
Maybe it's snow that fell before. Maybe it remembers how to make snowmen.
What's wrong with silly?
What's your name?
Nice name. Clara. You should definitely keep it. Goodbye!
I just spoke to her.
No, no impact at all. Those days are over.
She'll never be able to find me again. She doesn't even have the name. Doctor. What two words?
This snow is new. Possibly alien. When you find something brand new in the world, something you've never seen before, what's the next thing you look for?
A profit. That's Victorian values for you.
Why?
It's none of our business.
Permission granted.
Thank you, Strax. And if ever I'm in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know.
It is not our problem. Over a thousand years of saving the universe, Strax, you know the one thing I learned? The universe doesn't care.
Now, we have a problem of our own to worry about.
Don't worry. No one's going to hurt you.
That's Strax. And as you can see, he's easily confused.
Sontaran. Clone warrior race. Factory produced, whole legions at a time. Two genders is a bit further than he can count.
Typical middle child of six million.
It doesn't matter because you're about to forget that you and I ever met.
Don't worry, it won't hurt, but one touch on your bare skin and you lose the last hour of your memory.
Where is it?
I sent you to get the memory worm.
You didn't use the gauntlets, did you?
You.
Well, can you see it?
Oi, don't try to run away. Stay where you are.
What's funny?
Maybe. He gave his life for a friend of mine once.
Another friend of mine brought him back. I'm not sure all his brains made the return trip!
Ooo! Can you reach it? Have you got it?
There you go. One touch and you lose about an hour of your memory. Let it bite you and you could lose decades.
And you're still not trying to run.
Clara who?
Oh, dangerous question.
The snow emits a low level telepathic field.
It seems to reflect people's thoughts and memories and because it's unusual, somehow it carries a previous shape and
Ah! Interesting. Well, were you thinking about it?
Well, stop. Clara, stop thinking about the snowmen!
Get down! Clara, listen to me. The snow's feeding off your thoughts.
You're caught in their telepathic field. They're mirroring you. The more you think about the snowmen, the more they appear. Imagine them melting. Picture it. Picture them melted!
Well, very good. Very, very good. Ha!
Well, if it does, you know what to do about it.
Don't come looking for me. Forget about me. You understand?
Not my problem. Merry Christmas. Take her back where we found her.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
The snow is feeding off your thoughts. The more you think about the snowmen, the more they appear.
Yes? What? I'm trying to read.
That's always pointless. What did she say? Well? Well?
Oh, nice office. Big globey thing. Now, shut up, don't tell me! I see from your collar stud you have an apple tree and a wife with a limp. Am I right?
Do you have a wife?
Bit of a tree? Bit of a wife? Some apples? Come on, work with me here.
Do you have a goldfish named Colin?
Thought not. Now, ooo. I see this is one of your business cards. It says so on the front.
This. Wakey, wakey!
Ooo. Talking snow. I love new things.
Takes one to snow one. Right, let's see. Multi-nucleate crystalline organism with the ability to mimic and mirror what it finds. Looks like snow. Isn't snow.
Shut up, I'm making deductions. It's very exciting. Now, what are you, eh? A flock of space crystals? A swarm? The snowmen are foot soldiers, mindless predators. But you, you're the clever one. You're Moriarty. So, you turn up on a planet, you generate a telepathic field to learn what you can, and when you've learnt enough, what do you do? You can't conquer the world using snowmen. Snowmen are rubbish in July. You'll have to be better than that. You'll have to evolve.
You need to translate yourself into something more, well, human.
To do that you'd need a perfect duplicate of human DNA in ice form. Where do you find that?
Now, let's see. Most opened file, most viewed page.
You know, you really should delete your history. Governess frozen in pond. Gotcha!
Body frozen in a pond. The snow gets a good long look at a human being, like a full body scan. Everything they need to evolve. Pond. Good point, Clara. What are you doing here?
Grenades?
Help for what?
Investigation? Who says I'm investigating? Do you think I'm going to start investigating just because some bird smiles at me? Who do you think I am?
Don't be clever, Strax. It doesn't suit you.
I'm the clever one, you're the potato one.
Now go away.
Oi! Shut up. You're not clever or funny and you've got tiny little legs!
Okay, just tell her you're leaving, you're not going up. Leaving. Not going up.
What was that about? Five minutes, where did that come from? You.
That's the way to do it.
Oi. Ow.
No, don't worry. She's currently draining through your carpet. New setting. Anti-freeze. And you're very welcome, by the way.
No, you didn't, because I don't. Because this isn't the sort of thing I do any more. Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to
Sorry, it's just. Didn't know I'd put it on.
Old habits
Yeah, it is, isn't it? It is very cool. Bow ties are cool.
Er, er, she's learnt not to melt. Of course, she's not really a governess, she's just a beast. She's going to eat you. Run.
It's okay. I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we've just been upstairs kissing!
So, any questions?
Vastra, what's happening?
They're made of snow, Strax. They're already smithereens. See, Clara? Our friends again.
Your current governess is in reality a former barmaid called Clara.
Meanwhile your previous governess is now a living ice sculpture impersonating Mister Punch. Jenny, what have you got?
Right, everyone in there. Now. Move it. You, carry her.
I'm not engaging again, I'm under attack.
Shut up.
Strax, how long have we got?
Way, aye, aye. Well done, Straxie. Still got it, buddy.
So there's something here they want.
Exactly.
Because she's a perfect duplication of human DNA in ice crystal form. The ultimate fusion of snow and humanity. To live here, the snow needs to evolve and she's the blueprint. She's what they need to become. When the snow melted last night, did the pond?
Living ice that will never melt. If the snow gets hold of that creature on the stairs, it will learn to make more of them. It will build an army of ice. And it will be the last day of humanity on this planet.
Stay here.
Oi, I told you to stay in there.
You do that a lot.
Who said I like you?
You kissed me.
We need to get her out of here but keep her away from them.
With this. Do I always have to state the obvious?
No danger to you, as long as I get that thing out of here. You, in there, now.
Between you and me, I can't wait to find out.
Right, if you look after everyone here, then I can. Clara!
That was stupid.
I'm allowed. I'm good at stupid.
Mirroring. Random mirroring. We need to get on the roof.
No, I do the hand grabbing. That's my job. That's always me!
Come on, quickly! What are you doing?
Your bustle?
You're going to have to take those clothes off. I didn't mean.
Good.
Who said I've got a plan?
Maybe I'm an idiot.
Are you?
If I've got a plan, what is it? You tell me.
Yes.
Kill us.
So, come on then. Plan. Do I have one?
No, you didn't.
Show me.
Because we'll be dead in under thirty seconds. Do I have a plan?
So?
After you.
My eyes are always front!
Stop it.
No. No one can control clouds, that would be silly. The wind, a little bit.
That's the idea. Keep her away from the snow. So. Barmaid or governess, which is it?
Well, we can't chat after we've been horribly killed, can we?
Clever staircase. It's taller on the inside.
Super dense water vapour. Should keep her trapped for the moment.
I have done for a long time now.
I'm not sulking.
That's no more a box than you are a governess.
It's called the Tardis. It can travel anywhere in time and space. And it's mine.
Go on, say it. Most people do.
Okay, that is a first.
It's a ship.
Best ship in the universe.
Another first.
Souffls?
You followed me, remember? I didn't invite you.
I never know why. I only know who.
Me. Giving in.
I do. Remember this. This right now, remember all of it. Because this is the day. This is the day. This is the day everything begins.
Clara! Clara!
Water vapour doesn't stop ice. I should've realised.
Let her go. Let her go now! Now!
No. Clara!
Nooooo!
No, not in here.
She's going to be fine. I know she is. She has to be.
It was my fault. I am responsible for what happened to Clara. She was in my care.
None. Because she's going to live.
Hey. Hello.
And I know you're going to live.
I never know how. I just know who.
If I do, will you come away with me?
Well then. Merry Christmas.
I have in my hand a piece of the Ice Lady. Everything you need to know about how to make ice people. Is that what you want? See you at the office.
Yes. And don't you think, after all this time and everything I've ever done, that I am owed this one?
It was my fault.
Big fella here's been very quiet while you've been out. Which is only to be expected, considering who he really is. Do you know what this is, big fella?
A map of the London Underground, 1967. Key strategic weakness in metropolitan living, if you ask me, but then I have never liked a tunnel.
Just stripping away the disguise.
Of course it sounds like a child. It is a child. Simeon as a child. The snow has no voice without him.
How long has the Intelligence been talking to you?
But the snow doesn't talk, does it. It's just a mirror.
It just reflects back everything we think and feel and fear.
You poured your darkest dreams into a snowman and look, look what it became.
It's a parasite feeding on the loneliness of a child and the sickness of an old man. Carnivorous snow meets Victorian values and something terrible is born.
Oh yes, and what a plan. A world full of living ice people. Oh dear me, how very Victorian of you.
Ah, ah, ah. Are you sure?
Good. I'm glad you think so, since your entire adult life is about to be erased. No parasite without a host. Without you, it will have no voice. Without the governess, it will have no form.
You've got nothing left to mirror any more. Goodbye.
That's not possible. How is that possible?
But you were just Doctor Simeon. You're not real. He dreamed you. How can you still exist?
Argh!
Argh!
The snow mirrors, that's all it does. It's mirroring something else now. Something so strong, it's drowning everything else.
There was a critical mass of snow at the house. If something happened there
It's not raining. It's crying. The only force on Earth that could drown the snow. A whole family crying on Christmas Eve.
We saved the world, Clara, you and me. We really, really did.
No more cloud. Not now.
It rained.
No, I shouldn't think so. It learned to survive beyond physical form.
The Great Intelligence. Rings a bell. The Great Intelligence.
I never knew her name. Her full name.
Souffl girl. Oswin. It was her.
It was souffl girl again. I never saw her face the first time with the Daleks, but her voice, it was the same voice.
The same woman, twice. And she died both times. The same woman!
Something's going on. Something impossible, something. Right, you two stay here. Stay right here. Don't move an inch.
Shouldn't think so!
To find her. To find Clara. Ha ha ha!
Clara Oswin Oswald. Watch me run.

Leave this planet or I'll stop you.
The world is in your hands.
Here comes trouble! How're you doing, Ricky boy?
Buy me a drink first.
But worth it.
I told you, you don't need a passport.
Oi!
Are you saying I'm not handsome?
The rift was healed back in 1869.
But perfect for the Tardis, so just park it here for a couple of days right on top of the scar and
And space!
Yeah.
Should take another twenty four hours, which means we've got time to kill.
It's called a chameleon circuit. The Tardis is meant to disguise itself wherever it lands, like if this was Ancient Rome, it'd be a statue on a plinth or something. But I landed in the 1960s, it disguised itself as a police box, and the circuit got stuck.
Yeah, on street corners. Phone for help before they had radios and mobiles. If they arrested someone, they could shove them inside till help came, like a little prison cell.
I like it, don't you?
Ricky, let me tell you something about the human race. You put a mysterious blue box slap bang in the middle of town, what do they do? Walk past it. Now, stop your nagging. Let's go and explore.
I don't know. Cardiff, early twenty first century and the wind's coming from the east. Trust me. Safest place in the universe.
You're lying through your teeth!
How could you not know it was there?
And I was having such a nice day.
Excuse me. Who's in charge?
Right, here's the plan. (pause) Like he said. Nice plan. Anything else?
Ready.
Yup.
Hello, I've come to see the Lord Mayor.
No, just an old friend passing by. Bit of a surprise. Can't wait to see her face.
Just go in there and tell her the Doctor would like to see her.
Just the Doctor. Tell her exactly that. The Doctor.
She's climbing out of the window, isn't she?
Slitheen heading north.
Margaret!
Mickey the idiot.
I could do this all day.
You tried to kill me and destroy this entire planet.
So, you're a Slitheen, you're on Earth, you're trapped. Your family get killed but you teleport out just in the nick of time. You have no means of escape. What do you do? You build a nuclear power station. But what for?
And it just so happens to be right on top of the rift.
This station is designed to explode the minute it reaches capacity.
Oh, but she's clever.
Fantastic.
Couldn't have put it better myself.
How'd you think of the name?
I know, but how did you think of it?
Blaidd Drwg.
Bad Wolf.
Everywhere we go. Two words following us. Bad Wolf.
Nah, just a coincidence. Like hearing a word on the radio then hearing it all day. Never mind. Things to do. Margaret, we're going to take you home.
Raxacoricofallapatorius.
fallapatorius.
Not my problem.
Like I'd give you the secret, yeah.
Don't worship me - I'd make a very bad god. You wouldn't get a day off, for starters. Jack, how we doing, big fella?
But we can use it for fuel?
Then we're stuck here overnight.
Nothing, just.
I didn't butcher them.
I didn't. What about you? You had an emergency teleport. You didn't zap them to safety, did you?
Sorry. It is a bit funny.
Depends what it is.
Is that what you want, a last meal?
Strong enough.
You won't change my mind.
There are people out there. If you slip away just for one second, they'll be in danger.
Margaret, would you like to come out to dinner? My treat.
It's not a date. What's your name?
Nice to meet you, Blon.
Suppose not.
Pleasure.
Only what I've seen.
Yes, I did.
That's better. Now then, what do you think? Mmm, steak looks nice. Steak and chips.
I don't make the law.
What else can I do?
But then you'll just start again.
You've been in that skin suit too long. You've forgotten. There used to be a real Margaret Blaine. You killed her and stripped her and used the skin. You're pleading for mercy out of a dead woman's lips.
I don't believe you.
I believe you.
It doesn't mean anything.
You let one of them go, but that's nothing new. Every now and then, a little victim's spared because she smiled, because he's got freckles, because they begged. And that's how you live with yourself. That's how you slaughter millions. Because once in a while, on a whim, if the wind's in the right direction, you happen to be kind.
Can you hear that?
No, listen, shush.
Don't think you're running away.
It's the rift. The rift's opening!
What the hell are you doing??
It's the rift. Time and space are ripping apart. The whole city's going to disappear!
Never mind Cardiff, it's going to rip open the planet.
I might've known.
Of course, opening the rift means you'll pull this ship apart.
It's not just any old power source. It's the Tardis. My Tardis. The best ship in the universe.
The heart of the Tardis. This ship's alive. You've opened its soul.
Look at it, Margaret.
Look inside, Blon Fel Fotch. Look at the light.
Don't look. Stay there. Close your eyes!
Now, Jack, come on, shut it all down. Shut down! Rose, that panel over there, turn all the switches to the right.
Nicely done. Thank you, all.
No, I don't think she's dead.
She looked into the heart of the Tardis. Even I don't know how strong that is. And the ship's telepathic, like I told you, Rose. Gets inside your head. Translates alien languages. Maybe the raw energy can translate all sorts of thoughts.
Here she is.
Regressed to her childhood.
She can start again. Live her life from scratch. If we take her home, give her to a different family, tell them to bring her up properly, she might be all right!
That's her choice.
She's an egg.
We're all powered up. We can leave. Opening the rift filled us up with energy. We can go, if that's all right.
How's Mickey?
Do you want to go and find him? We'll wait.
Off we go, then. Always moving on
We'll just stop by and pop her in the hatchery. Margaret the Slitheen can live her life again. A second chance.

Help me up.
Help me into the Tardis, Jo.
All right, Jo.
The first thing we've got to do is get out of here.
Telepathic circuits. Sending a message to the Time Lords. I must tell them to. I must, I
Help me off with this.
Must lie down, Jo.
Must rest for a while. Must rest. I must rest, Jo.
Now, Jo, now listen to me. I'm liable to sleep for quite some time. Now, if anything happens, anything at all, record it in the log. Record it in the log.
Yes.
In the log, up there in the locker.
Jo! Jo, careful!
Jo! JO: Doctor?
Jo!
Jo? Jo, where are you?
Jo? Jo?
That's odd. The atmosphere outside is breathable and yet the automatic oxygen supply is on.
I'll just have to use the emergency supply.
All the circuits are in order. The door must be held from the outside. I must get it open. I must get that door open. Got to get the door, got to get that door open.
That's it. Must get it open. (falls to the floor) Must get it open. Must get, must get, must get.
Thank you. Thank you very much. How did you find me?
Is she all right?
Oh, I'm sorry, it's just, just that I thought I knew you.
Where are you from?
Skaro! Yes, of course, you're Thals!

Oh, many years ago. During the Dalek war.
Yes.
Well, I can assure you that I was.
By travelling through the barriers of time. If you must know, I was with the Thal group when they broke into the Dalek city.
Yes. Barbara, Ian and Susan.
The Doctor.
That's right.
Now you listen to me, young man. You may have saved my life, and I'm grateful, but that does not give you the right to subject me to an inquisition!
What?
What are you doing?
Now? Why, what would have happened?
Ah, that's nice.
Oh.
Tell me, what's the name of this planet?
Is it inhabited?
Any intelligent life form?
Mmm, I'd very much like to see one of them. I mean, I'd very much like to come into contact with one of them.
You said just now that you were on some sort of mission. May one ask what it is?
As you wish. I'm on something of a special mission myself.
Well, whatever it was you came here to do, it must be pretty important.
How many are there of you?
Oh, only three left.
Well, you could make that four if you'd let me help you. Five with Jo Grant.
You still don't trust me?
Yes, I see your point. But I am on your side, you know?
Yes, never felt better.
That's good.
Understood.
Spiridons?
What's this? Some kind of weapon?
Daleks!
Motive power nil. Total loss of vision. Sensor plates not functioning, and weaponry deactivated.
Yes, well I've had cause to. This one's something new. I've never come across Daleks that have mastered invisibility before.
Yes, a terrifying advantage. Have you any idea how they do it?
I see.
No, don't do that. No, most Daleks have an automatic distress call. Even when they're deactivated, the transmitter may keep functioning.
Taron seems very cautious.
Oh? Who is Miro.
Oh, I'm sorry. And Taron, who's he?
Oh, do you think so? I thought he seemed to be doing rather well.
Well, what do you think he should do?
How many Daleks are there, do you know?
Tell me about these creatures that live here, the Spiridons. Are they invisible at all times?
Are they working with the Daleks?
Mass exterminations followed by absolute suppression of the survivors. I know.
Fascinating.
Mmm.
Oh, how?
Vaber!
Hang on! Just hang on! I got it! Quickly, your hand. Let go! Let it go! Let it go.
Oh, it's all right. Nothing much. Just that some sort of tentacle tried to make a breakfast of our friend here.
My pleasure. Made an interesting little object lesson.
Well, just that it shows the need for continued caution, I think.
There's a considerable difference between courage and reckless stupidity, you know.
Unless they change direction, they're bound to find us.
Thank you.
But Jo Grant's inside your ship. I've got to do something.
No! Wait! Wait. Somebody's still in there.
No! No!
Jo.
Codal. So, they captured you too, did they?
Well, they're all right as far as I know. How are you?
That's good.
Oh, I expect they're saving us for interrogation. They'll want to know what we're doing on this planet. You know, what you did back there, leading the searchers away from us, was very courageous.
Oh, I don't know. I think you're doing yourself rather an injustice there. If you hadn't acted the way you did, we'd have all been captured. They give medals for that sort of bravery.
And do you think they're any the less brave because of that?
Well, forgive me if I'm wrong, but aren't you a volunteer?
Then you must have known what you were getting into?
Ah, you, my friend. You may be a very brilliant scientist but you have very little understanding of people, particularly yourself. Courage isn't just a matter of not being frightened, you know.
It's being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway, just as you did.
Right, well, after that little tutorial on bravery, let's see if we can find a way of getting out of here.
Yes, escape. Well, let's take a look in our pockets and see if we can come up with something that might prove useful. Come on. Turn 'them out. Sonic screwdriver.
Fancy hankie.
Yes, that's right. She'd gone to fetch help for me. The Daleks
No, they murdered her.
No, that's hopeless. If there's one thing the Daleks are very good at making, that is locks.
Well, we'll just have to start our escape when the door's already open.
Yes, exactly. So, we're not trying to deal with a door, we're trying to deal with a Dalek.
How. That's a very good question. How. Well, there must something here that could prove useful.
Come on, come on. We've got to think of something.
On the contrary, my friend, the Daleks don't intend to let us rot down here, you know.
A tiny motor with an electric power source. That's it. Yes. Yes, I'll dismantle the circuitry, reverse the polarity and convert to a low power receiver transmitter with a positive feedback.
Correct, and if we can jam them
It should give them quite a brainstorm. Give me your screwdriver.
Hmm?
No, I'm afraid not, Codal. You see, the Daleks armour acts as a sort of shield, so we've got to get in very close. In any case, the effect will only be temporary.
Well, if we're lucky, long enough to get away. That is, if
If it works.
Oh, well, that's it. That's the best that I can do. There's only one thing we need now.
A Dalek to try it out on.
Come sit here. Now remember what I told you. Get in close so that it can't use its blaster, right?
Now!
Hold on! Hold it!
Mind yourself. Hold on to it! Hold on to it!
Hold it!
Had quite an effect.
Not any more, I'm afraid. You know, for a man who abhors violence, I must say I took great satisfaction in doing that. Right, let's get on. We may be out of the cell but we're a long way from being free.
Get your gun.
Back! Back!
Back to the lift!
Back to the lift!
Well, it's not going up. They must be operating it by remote control. Well, there's only one thing for it, we'll have to go down.
That was close.
Presumably that's their intention. Still, we haven't much alternative, have we? Let's try another level.
Thank you very much.
I know it's not the moment to ask how you got in there, but I'd be fascinated to know how.
Push it up! Use your knife. Right, now lever it down, lever it down. Right, now push! That's it!
Doors are closing!
You must! Pull!
Come on. Put your leg here.
Out of here! Quick! Out! Come on, get him out of here!
Come on.
Come on, hurry up. The door's going to close. Come on through. Come on, Marat! Marat, come on! Marat!
Come on, Marat!
Marat!
Right, now cover your eyes.
Never underestimate the Daleks, Codal. They won't let a little matter of a metal door delay them for long.
Yes?
Oh. I don't know whether I've locked the Daleks out or ourselves in.
Well, if it wasn't for the fact that it doesn't make sense, I'd say it was a gigantic refrigeration unit.
Yes.
What's this?
Right, that's it then.
You're probably right. Nevertheless it does lead up to the surface, doesn't it?
Well, it's pretty obvious they'd do something of the sort.
Nothing. When faced with the inevitable, don't waste precious time by resisting it. Now, what would you say the tensile strength of this material is?
Huh. That's precisely what we are going to do. Come with me, Taron. I want to show you something.
Yes, exactly, but if we can turn the refrigeration unit up to maximum, the updraft will be hotter and even more powerful. Now look at this.
Exactly. And if we can trap enough of it, we might be able to rise with it.
I've no idea. We haven't got much choice. TARON: Let's get on with it.
Oh no.
Give it time, Taron, give it time.
It's lifting! It's beginning to lift! Hang on tight! Hang on!
It's hard to tell. Let's hope we're high enough to be out of range.
Yes, we are out of range. That's a relief. You all right, Rebec?
Miles, I should think. Don't forget we started at the lowest level of the city. Should be a long, slow haul.
You know, after this, I think I must take up hot air ballooning. It really is most exhilarating.
Ah, cheer up, my dear. Just you hang on tight. We're perfectly safe.
Well, its rate of ascent doesn't seem much faster than ours. We should reach the surface before it can catch up with us.
The whole thing's going! Get on the side! Hang on!
Right!
Yes, well, I think we ought to postpone the celebrations until we're in a slightly safer area. Come on.
Jo!
Jo, you were on that Thal spaceship. I saw it destroyed.
But you were.
Well, it's a long story and there were a few moments that were a trifle worrying
You know Codal and Taron, don't you?
I don't think you've met Rebec.
Yeah, but
Yes, I know that
All right, all right, Jo
Jo! Jo! Jo! Please? Look, will you excuse us for a moment? My friend has rather a lot to tell me about.
But, Jo, why on earth didn't you stay in the Tardis? We'd have been safe there.
On a planet full of Daleks? Well, surely I warned you?
Did I?
Oh, I'm sorry, Jo. I'm afraid I wasn't myself.
Well, I told them about the Dalek spaceship leaving the Ogron planet and told them to send the Tardis after it.
They've got an army based here, Jo, the mightiest army of Daleks there's ever been.
Well, evidently that was only part of their plan, to make their conquest easier perhaps. With an army this size, we now know they intend to invade the galaxy anyway unless we can stop them.
And our Thal friends. Oh dear. Perhaps a female shoulder to cry on might come in handy.
Give it a try, will you?
The load getting a little heavy?
Oh, why? Just because you've found out that you're not made of stone?
Then they should have sent a machine, shouldn't they.
Good, because the business of command is not for a machine, is it? The moment that we forget that we're dealing with people, then we're no better off than the machines that we came here to destroy. When we start acting and thinking like the Daleks, Taron, the battle is lost.
Well done, Jo. If those two are all right, we at least have a chance.
Then we must find shelter.
You know, this planet never ceases to amaze me. First we find a gigantic refrigerator and now night storage heaters. It really sounds quite luxurious.
Oh, that's nice. Right, let's get going. Jo, where did you hide the bombs?
(sotto) What are those animals?
(sotto) That's good. At least we can see them now. Did you notice anything peculiar about the Daleks, Jo?
Only that their movements seem to be slower.
Yes, but the reason. The reason is the important thing.
Yes, yes, of course.
Come on, Jo. Come and keep me company.
What?
He doesn't stand a chance.
If that's what you want.
Have you still got your guns with you?
That's good. Keep them handy, will you? Look around you.
I've no idea, but whatever they are, they're moving in closer.
Yes, but they don't stay scared for long, do they?
Well, if they come in ones and twos, we might manage to beat them off.
I'm going to try something.
Don't just stand round there, get yourselves torches. They're frightened of flame.
We'll just have to hope that supply lasts till morning. We've got to keep that fire going at all costs!
Oh, I was just thinking about Vaber. What on Earth possessed him to go rushing off like that?
Plan, what plan?
What? But that's the worse thing he could possibly do.
On the contrary, you'd be bringing their army to life.
No ageing process, no degeneration. An army of Daleks in cold storage until they're needed.
Yes, that's about it. And the moment that temperature rises, the Dalek army's going to be on the move. Now we've got to find the others and warn them.
A Spiridon!
You sure?
Well, please accept my thanks, Mister Wester. I owe you a very great deal.
Except, presumably, the Daleks?
Well, thank you for warning us. We'll do all that we can to help you.
Well, we'll wait till it's full light. If they're not back by then, we move out without them.
Well, first of all we've got to stop the Daleks releasing their bacteria. Second, we've got to make sure their army stays inactive, and third, we've got to generally put an end to their chances of invasion of other planets.
(sotto) I haven't the faintest idea.
Where on earth did you get those?
Well done. Have you got the bombs?
Now, wait. We can't go on running forever. It's time for a change of tactics.
No, I agree, so let's stop for a moment and use our intelligence, shall we?
Well, to take any effective and permanent action, we've got to get inside that city.
Well, I do have a plan, but you'll have to trust me.
Well, first of all, we've got to make sure that a Dalek patrol finds us. Somebody must go out, show themselves and then lead them back here.
Thank you, Latep. Now try and lead them around for a bit before you bring them back here. We'll need a little time to get ourselves ready.
Jo!
Yes, all right.
Taron?
I noticed this this morning. Have you seen them before?
Yes, and hyper-cold. Yes, it's an odd phenomena, the water on this planet. It sustains sub-zero temperatures and yet remains semi-liquid.
The Daleks are vulnerable to extremely low temperatures and they hardly function at all at sub-zero levels.
Yes, it's a good feeling, isn't it? When the hunted become the hunters.
Right, you all set?
Good.
Come on, Jo!
(sotto) All right, I'll try and draw them off that way.
Taron! Taron, get ready!
Get out of its line of fire!
Pull it!
Well done. Well done, everybody! Now, come on, Taron. We've got work to do.
Keep out of their angle of fire. They may still be dangerous. Right, now lift up the top section. Are they dead?
Right, get that one up onto the bank.
You all right, Rebec?
Latep, you're sure you know the way to the ventilator shaft?
I'm sorry, Jo. No, it must be a two-pronged attack to double our chances of success. Have you got the bomb? Whichever group gets there first must detonate that bomb in one of the tunnels near the cooling unit. Block off the Daleks completely. Now, whatever you do, don't damage the refrigeration unit. It's absolutely vital that that continues to function.
More gentle persuasion?
Right, put it on.
Well, Jo, do I pass?
And to you.
All right, Rebec?
Okay.
Right, off we go.
Presumably they're preparing the bacteria.
That's Wester!
(sotto) If they open that hermetically sealed door even a fraction of an inch, the bacteria will escape and destroy everything including themselves.
(sotto) Let's try and get to the lower levels.
The cloak! Come on, over it!
Get going!
Get it out! Come on!
This way!
Come on! Come on! They're right behind you!
This way! This way! In you go.
Out, quick!
Well, Rebec, it seems you stopped being a Dalek just in time. DOCTOR: Come on, in you get. Come on, Taron, quick.
Come on, in you get. Come on, Taron, quick.
Down to the arsenal.
He's right, you know. One bomb won't destroy them all. The most we can hope for is to stop that army getting into action.
(sotto) Okay, come on.
Look, see what you can find in the cooling chamber act as a barricade. Block off that corridor as best you can.
I know we can't stop them but it might hold them up for a bit.
There you are, Rebec. The greatest Dalek invasion force ever assembled.
That's about it. Right, let's go and help the others with the barricade.
That should hold them for a while. Rebec, stay near. At the slightest sound of the Daleks breaking through, give us plenty of warning. Come on, you two.
Any sign of Jo and Latep?
Blast! I was hoping there'd be a way of locking these controls into the on position. As soon as this refrigeration unit is switched off, those Daleks will be on the move.
No. Then we'll have to use my other plan. Come on. Let's us know as soon as you see Jo and Latep.
Well, it should hold them for a little while yet. Now, don't worry. Come on.
Yes?
Thank you, Taron. Come on, we haven't much time.
Hello?
Well, it looks promising. How deep is it?
Well, that's it then, although it does need a bit of clearing.
Yes, the temperature has risen quite considerably.
In a minute, they'll all be fully active. Come on. Here.
That should be wide enough.
Thank you, Taron. Look, I've got an idea that these catwalks lead to some sort of loading area on the surface. Check it out, will you?
Right, get the bomb.
Where is it?
Is it damaged?
Can you fix it?
Get on with it.
Good, good.
Well, this whole area is simply honeycombed with ice tunnels. Now, a bomb put in the right place could so weaken those walls that the pressure of the ice would burst through the walls and flood this entire chamber.
That's the theory.
Yes, but it would centuries to melt them out.
Well done, Jo.
Taron, you and the others get started. We'll set the bomb.
Set it to detonate in thirty seconds.
Off you go.
Twenty seven, twenty eight
It failed! Come on, let's get out of here.
The ice volcano!
Out, everybody, out!
Yes, of course.
As a matter of fact, there is.
Throughout history, you Thals have always been known as one of the most peace loving peoples in the galaxy.
Yes, well that's what I mean. When you get back to Skaro, you'll all be national heroes. Everybody will want to hear about your adventures.
So be careful how you tell that story, will you? Don't glamorise it. Don't make war sound like an exciting and thrilling game.
Tell them about the members of your mission that will not be returning, like Maro and Vaber and Marat. Tell them about the fear, otherwise your people might relish the idea of war. We don't want that.
Thank you, my dear. Well, you'd better get aboard, I think.
I'm not sure about them. Goodbye, Rebec.
Taron?
Good luck.
If that what she wants, no.
Thank you, Latep.
Right, shall we go and find the Tardis?
Come on, run!
They're coming! Now cover your face and hands as best you can! Come on!
Jo, come on! Come on!
Jo, look. That's Skaro.
Any regrets?
But Jo, that's only one little world. There's so many hundreds of others to see.
That one? But, Jo, that's Earth.
Home it is, Miss Grant.

What are you doing here?
We?
What do you want?
Really? In here? Are you sure?
(aside) One of their pupils, not the police, then.
Why were you were spying on her? Who are you?
Your hearing must be very acute. I didn't hear anything.
You imagined it.
Young man, is it reasonable to suppose that anybody would be inside a cupboard like that, hmm?
I wonder why I've never seen that before. Now isn't that strange. Very damp and dirty.
Have to be cleaned. Hmm? Oh, I'm afraid it's none of my business. I suggest you leave here.
Yours leaves a lot to be desired.
There's nothing in there.
Afraid? Oh, go away.
Very well.
Oh, am I? I don't think so, young man. No, I don't think so.
Don't you think you're being rather high-handed, young man? You thought you saw a young girl enter the yard. You imagine you heard her voice. You believe she might be inside there. It's not very substantial, is it?
I'm not hindering you. If you both want to make fools of yourselves, I suggest you do what you said you'd do. Go and find a policeman.
Insulting. There's only one way in and out of this yard. I shall be here when you get back. I want to see your faces when you try to explain away your behaviour to a policeman.
Close the door!
Close the door, Susan. I believe these people are known to you.
They must have followed you. That ridiculous school. I knew something like this would happen if we stayed in one place too long.
And what's wrong with it?
Perhaps.
I don't discuss my private life with strangers.
You don't deserve any explanations. You pushed your way in here uninvited and unwelcome.
Oh dear, dear, dear dear. This is very
It's stopped again, you know, and I've tried hmm? Oh, you wouldn't understand.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed to find a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but I think it'll serve.
What is he talking about now?
You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed? You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smaller sitting rooms.
But you've discovered television, haven't you?
Then by showing an enormous building on your television screen, you can do what seemed impossible, couldn't you?
Not quite clear, is it. I can see by your face that you're not certain. You don't understand. And I knew you wouldn't. Never mind. Now then, which switch was it? No. No, no. Ah yes, that is it. The point is not whether you understand. What is going to happen to you, hmm? They'll tell everybody about the ship now.
Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know.
Quite so.
Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the Red Indian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought it an illusion, too.
Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted.
Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don't enjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the fourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off from our own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall get back. Yes, one day. One day.
No.
You still think it's all an illusion?
Your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance.
I can't stop you.
And by tomorrow we shall be a pubic spectacle, a subject for news and idle gossip.
My dear child, of course they will. Put yourself in their place. They are bound to make some sort of a complaint to the authorities, or at the very least talk to their friends. If I do let them go, Susan, you realise of course we must go, too.
There's no alternative, child.
It's out of the question.
Now you're being sentimental and childish.
Very well. Then you must go with them. I'll open the door.
Let me go.
Get back to the ship, child. Hold it.
Layer of sand, rock formation. Good.
Oh, yes, undoubtedly. I'll be able to tell you where presently. Zero? That's not right. I'm afraid this yearometer is not calculating properly. Hm! Well, anyway, the journey's finished. (to Ian) What are you doing down there?
Yes, look up there. They don't understand and I suspect they don't want to. Well, there you are. A new world for you.
Yes, that's the immediate view outside the ship.
You really are a stubborn young man, aren't you?
They are saying I'm a charlatan. What concrete evidence would satisfy you?
Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about?
No.
Not until I'm quite sure it's safe to do so. Well, yes, good. Yes, it is, it's good. Excellent, excellent. You've got the radiation counter there. What's it read?
Splendid, splendid. Well, I think I'll take my Geiger counter with me in any case. So, you still challenge me, young man?
You're so narrow-minded, aren't you? Don't be so insular.
Yes, we've gone back in time, all right. One or two samples and I shall be able to make an estimate. With rock pieces and a few plants. But I do wish this wouldn't keep letting me down. However, we can go out now.
Yes, quite so.
That is quite correct. But your tone suggests ridicule.
Really? Where does time go, then?
(to Barbara) You're not as doubtful as your friend, I hope?
If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you?
Now, see for yourself.
Well I've no more time to argue with you. I must get some samples, Susan.
(exiting, muttering) Oh, dear, it's disgusting really.
It's still a police box. Why hasn't it changed? Dear, dear, how very disturbing.
Where's my, where.
I can make fire for you. Let me go and I'll make all the fire you want. You don't have to be afraid of me. I'm an old man. How can an old man like me harm any of you?
(searching his pockets) My matches. Where are they? I must get back. Must get back to the ship.
Take me back to my ship and I will make fire for you. All the fire you want.
I have no matches. I cannot make fire. I cannot make fire!
If he dies, there will be no fire.
All right.
We should use our cunning. I hope you can get yourself free, Chesterton. I can't. The stench in here. The stench. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I'm desperately sorry.
Look at that. Look at it. (skulls)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's all my fault. I'm desperately sorry.
Look at those. Look at them. (the skulls)
Oh, it's hopeless, hopeless. Even if we do get free, we shall never move that stone.
Well you obviously are.
No, no, don't waste time. Try those bones, they may be. They're sharper, perhaps.
We must all take it in turns and try and cut his hands free.
No, no, we've got to free you first. You're the strongest, and you may have to defend us.
Susan, you have a go. My arms are tired.
And don't think of failing.
Well, try and remember, if you can, how you and the others found your way here. Concentrate on that please.
Fear makes companions of all of us. That's right.
Fear is with all of us, and always will be. Just like that other sensation that lives with it.
Your companion referred to it. Hope. Hope, that's right.
There will be no fire.
Stop. Just a minute, let me get my
Just a moment.
I know. I know that. But I must get. Breathe. I must breathe.
There's no need for that. Don't be so childish. I'm not senile. Just let me get my breath for a moment.
Yes. I'm not so young, you know.
I'm all right. Don't keep on looking upon me as the weakest link of the party.
What nonsense.
Oh, sheer nonsense, child. Imagination.
I'm hot with all this exertion.
I expect so.
Do you think I want to?
You seem to have elected yourself leader of this little party.
Just so long as you understand I won't follow your orders blindly.
Aren't you a tiresome young man!
Oh, sheer imagination.
I won't allow myself to be frightened out of my wits by mere shadows, that's all.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
It must have just been killed. By a larger animal, too.
Susan! You stay here with me.
Silence! We're going back to the ship.
What are you doing? They must be out of their minds.
What exactly do you think you're doing?
One minute ago we were trying desperately to get away from these savages.
I'm not a doctor of medicine.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, child.
You're trying to say that everything you do is reasonable, and everything I do is inhuman. Well, I'm afraid your judgement's at fault, Miss Wright, not mine. Haven't you realised if these two people can follow us, any of these people can follow us? The whole tribe might descend upon us at any moment.
And what about the old woman who cut our bonds? You understand?
You're not going to take him back to the ship?
Do you think so? These people have logic and reason, have they? Can't you see their minds change as rapidly as night and day? She's probably telling the whole tribe at this very moment.
Get your hand off me.
Well, I, I was going to get him to draw our way back to the Tardis.
You don't expect me to carry him, do you?
Oh, very well.
This knife has no blood on it. I said, this knife has no blood on it.
It is a finer knife than yours.
This knife can cut and stab. I have never seen a better knife.
This knife shows what it has done. There is blood on it. (to Za) Who killed the old woman?
(to Kal) You killed the old woman.
Is this your strong leader? One who kills your old women? He is a bad leader. He will kill you all. Yes, all. (to Ian) Follow my example.
Drive him out. Out.
Don't struggle.
This place is evil.
We are making fire.
Don't stop.
Do you understand? We are making fire for you.
He is the least important because we can all make fire.
Give him a chance. Give him a chance. Let him show the tribe fire, establish himself as leader, then he'll let us go.
When are you going to let us go, hmm?
Quench the fire. Take the fire away from them. Scaring them, somehow.
Yes.
Yes, it's matching up.
Oh, how I wish.
You know I can't do that. Please be reasonable.
You see, this isn't operating properly. Or rather, the code is still a secret. When you put the right data, precise information to a second of the beginning of a journey, then we can fix a destination, but I had no data at my disposal.
Well of course I can't. I'm not a miracle worker.
Well, I got you away from that other time, didn't I?
It's the only way I can answer you, young man. Now. Now we shall see.
It could be anywhere. Dear, dear, dear, dear. It's no help to us at all. Well, I suggest before we go outside and explore, let us clean ourselves up.
Now what does the radiation read, Susan?

Tegan, Tegan, Tegan.
There isn't any need to be.
It's your mind's way of coping with the experience. You've suffered a great deal.
No, he couldn't. The Mara during the process of its becoming. It had to be trapped between modes of its being.
Well, you're completely free of it now, Tegan. For you, the Mara is dead forever.
Indeed.
Warp ellipse cut out?
And what's the probability of that?
I'm afraid it's much more serious than that.
There's a chance something's on a collision course with the Tardis.
Well, there's a chance of anything. Statistically speaking, if you gave typewriters to a tree full of monkeys, they'd eventually produce the works of William Shakespeare.
Now, you and I know that at the end of the millennium they'd still be tapping out gibberish.
And you'd be tapping it out right along side them. I only asked you a simple question.
We can't. We've converged with the warp ellipse.
Hold this steady.
I'll try and materialise on board the ship. Hold tight!
I have a weird feeling the warp ellipse will be travelling for a very long time. Possibly through infinity.
Amazing.
There's a length of flight indicator. This ship's been in orbit three thousand years.
Mmm. Transmat terminal.
Well, someone certainly left the ship, almost six years ago.
Earth.
The ship's orbit takes it within range of Earth for six years.
Any time. Come on, let's get back to the Tardis.
Quickly.
The Tardis won't dematerialise.
I wonder.
I might have known.
The transmat beam, it's been operated. The signal is interfering with the Tardis.
Well, the capsule and the Tardis must be dimensionally very similar, and the beam's still functioning. It's supposed to cut out when the capsule completes its journey.
I hope so.
Ah.
In a manner of speaking. It's on Earth.
If these readings are correct, it's 1983 on Earth.
Well, the capsule originally left the ship six years ago.
Yes. I wonder what it's been up to all that time. Come on, back to the Tardis.
Who are you?
This is Turlough.
The transmat capsule.
Seven, eight. All set.
Earth, via the transmat capsule.
Well, it worked one way. Once I've disconnected the beam jamming the Tardis, you should follow me through to Earth.
You'll be safer in the Tardis.
All right, why not. See you on Earth.
Come on.
It's a pity those things don't have a wider range. Still, at least we're here in one piece. Transmat capsules can do very nasty things to organic structures if they're not properly maintained.
Done it.
Well, that shouldn't have happened.
Not with the dead reckoning alignment in the coordinates. This is 1983?
Then it should be here.
I hope so. Now, what did I do wrong?
Brigadier. Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge Stewart.
Brigadier?
I'd forgotten.
I've regenerated.
What would you say if I told you I was looking for my Tardis?
What about our time together with UNIT?
So you do remember.
Is there somewhere we could talk?
An undercover operation, is it, Brigadier? I mean, I hardly expected to find you at a boy's school.
Your quarters?
Quite.
Brigadier, I need your help. I've lost the Tardis.
And you don't remember me?
Oh, there's much more at stake than a breach of security. I've lost my Tardis, you've lost your memory. I'd be surprised if the two events weren't connected.
By the way, how's Sergeant Benton these days?
And Harry Sullivan?
Do you ever see anything of Jo Grant?
My assistant, Jo Grant.
Sarah Jane?
Liz Shaw you'll remember, of course.
Are you all right?
Perhaps it was a yeti, Colonel Lethbridge Stewart.
One lump or two, Brigadier?
It's hardly your fault, Brigadier.
Exactly.
The mental block, there must be some reason for it. Some trauma, some shocking experience, maybe some induced effect.
No, no, of course not. So, if there was a way of tracing how far back the inhibition goes, you could perhaps get some treatment.
Well, no.
Absolutely.
Brigadier
When did you leave UNIT, Brigadier?
And you teach?
Well, Brigadier, much as I appreciate your company, I've still got to find my Tardis.
Yes, well, just at the moment I'd settle for half a Tardis, and I'm very worried about Nyssa and Tegan.
What's the matter?
Oh, Tegan's after your time, Brigadier. She's travelling with me in the Tardis.
It is Tegan.
Your Tegan, my Tegan, it's the same person.
So, Tegan, Nyssa and the Tardis, they're all here.
Or rather, they were, if you see what I mean.
I must have miscalculated the offset. The Tardis came through in the right place, but the wrong time zone.
Now, it's vitally important you remember exactly what happened.
Very much in the present, Brigadier. You never did understand the interrelation of time.
You have in your memory the information I need to track down the Tardis and communicate with Nyssa and Tegan.
What worries me is the level of coincidence in all this. Almost as if some cosmic influence. Still, that won't get me the Tardis back. Now, Brigadier, we've got to establish the precise time all this happened.
Well, don't worry. Just relax. Think yourself back.
June the seventh, 1977. Well done, Brigadier. Come on.
He's trying to get away in the transmat capsule. That is, if he can repair the beam transmitter.
It could be done, given time.
Tegan is absolutely right. I am not in the Tardis.
You tell me, Brigadier.
Don't you see, Brigadier? The Tardis came to Earth in 1977 and so did the transmat capsule, carrying someone from that ship in space.
Indeed. And what did you think?
You were there.
You must. I need the information to protect Nyssa and Tegan.
That experience could be the reason for your nervous breakdown.
Now. Come on. We've got to get back to the capsule before Turlough works out how to operate it, or I may never get the Tardis back.
Quickly!
Reflect the beam back off the ship.
That's right.
Always the optimist, Brigadier.
By the way. Yours, I think.
Turlough, would you check to see if the transmitter's functioning? Tegan and Nyssa can use the beam as a beacon. If all goes well, the Tardis should reappear. Ah. Brigadier, quickly, think. Did you go into the Tardis with Tegan and Nyssa?
Of course it matters. Can you imagine what would happen if you walked out of the Tardis in 1977 and met yourself in 1983?
It's not ridiculous, Brigadier, almost certainly catastrophic.
Obviously. You'd exist twice over. And if the two of you met, you'd short out the time differential. Don't you see? The Blinovitch limitation effect? Oh dear. As Tegan would say, zap!
Oh no.
Thank you, Brigadier. The problem is now strictly academic. I cannot even return to the ship.
Unless I can assemble some equipment for tracking the Tardis, and soon.
Indeed.
What did you say?
Where?
Brigadier, where is it?
Come on. There isn't a moment to lose.
It isn't working.
Hopefully.
That's it.
It must be on the ship. I'm a fool. I should have realised.
Yes. Come on, the capsule.
You're forgetting this. The Tardis is on board the ship, and this will home in on the Tardis. Come on.
Good of you to come and see me off, Brigadier.
The transmat could be dangerous.
If you insist.
Turlough could be useful.
It still exists, but if you're so concerned about Turlough, set an example and stay behind.
Come on.
The creature will have left the Tardis by now. He'll need his own life support systems.
I don't remember that. Turlough, find the Tardis and stay with Nyssa and Tegan. Brigadier, I want you to come with me.
A metamorphic symbiosis regenerator.
Used by Time Lords in cases of acute regenerative crises.
It must have been stolen from Gallifrey.
Someone on this ship has been trying to regenerate.
It would explain the mutilation. Severe instability.
Or undead, Brigadier.
Extend its life.
I don't know, but you can be sure it's for no good reason. Ah. Brigadier, look at this.
Connections to the regenerator. Eight of them.
Somewhere.
There have been some very cunning modifications.
Oh, quite right. It could do very nasty things to a genuine Time Lord.
We should get back to the Tardis, Brigadier.
Right.
Er, wait here.
Where's Turlough?
And the Brigadier, but I've lost both of them.
You mean he's here with you as well?
How could you be so stupid!
He also insisted on coming with me.
Precisely. Come on, we've got to find them.
Better check the laboratory. Tegan, you stay here in case the Brigadier come past, in which case, stop him. Come on.
Brigadier, thank goodness you're all right. One of you, anyway.
It was you who stole the regenerator from Gallifrey.
And you modified the machine and created endless life for yourself.
Ah, you induced a perpetual mutation.
How were you able to come to Earth?
It's the result of your own criminal ambition.
Fools who tried to turn themselves into Time Lords. It all went disastrously wrong.
For what it's worth.
No.
I can't!
Don't you understand? If I did, it would be the end of me as a Time Lord.
I can only regenerate twelve times. I have already done so four times.
Don't you see? Eight of them, eight of me.
It's the only way to end their mutation.
With this equipment, yes.
You have the regenerator, the facilities of the laboratory. Continue your experiments, find how to reverse the process.
I cannot do what you ask.
I must.
I don't know.
You see, Brigadier, thanks to your imperfect memory there is now a Lethbridge Stewart some six years your junior at loose in this ship.
Well, I hope so, because I've got to get the Tardis away from here.
There isn't time to think, Brigadier.
Well, you're perfectly all right in 1983. Obviously your 1977 self came to no physical harm.
Stay here, all of you.
Turlough, listen very carefully. We have a problem with the Brigadier.
The two time zones. The Brigadier did go with Tegan and Nyssa. There are now two Lethbridge Stewarts on this ship.
Now, I will take the Brigadier in the Tardis back to 1983 Earth.
You must find the other Brigadier and take him to the transmat capsule. You'll be quite safe, the mutants won't harm you.
It will. The capsule is locked into the Tardis' homing device. It will transmat to the centre of the Tardis. I wired the device myself.
Now, when you arrive, whatever you do, stay in the capsule. Don't let the Brigadier out until I give you the word. Now, quickly.
I'm afraid so.
Sometimes you have to live with the consequences of your actions. Now, let's get away from here.
It takes a remarkably cunning set of the coordinates to clear a warp ellipse.
This is a temperamental old thing, but I'm getting remarkably good at sorting
Not at all. We're on course for the Brigadier's school. You see, there was a problem with
I don't know.
Mawdryn? That's it! They've been contaminated.
No, don't touch them. The transfiguration can be controlled.
Stop. That's it. Travelling through time is accelerating the degeneration.
Well, more than that. We're going back to where we started. I just hope it induces a proportional remission.
Are you two all right?
You were infected when you carried Mawdryn into the Tardis. The journey to his ship would have made it worse.
Well, it shouldn't be. I can only assume their constant experimenting to correct their error brought about a viral side effect.
I don't know.
That won't work. I've got to programme a temporal deviation to escape the warp ellipse.
I wonder. If I reverse the polarity of the neutron flow
Oh, no.
Oh yes, it is.
We're travelling in the opposite direction out of the ellipse. It's having a reverse effect.
Someone's trying to operate the transmat capsule. Must be Turlough taking your other half to the centre of the Tardis.
Only when the Tardis is clear of the ship. Until that happens, the transmat can't take place. The capsule will return to its terminal.
It's no good. I can't get clear of the ship without hurting Nyssa and Tegan.
Take me to your laboratory.
You will activate the energy transfer, Brigadier. It will take several moments for the charge in the machine to build up. You can read off the countdown to the moment of exchange. Are you all right?
Activate, Brigadier, now.
No, Brigadier, get out of here!
Are you all right?
A massive discharge of energy exactly synchronising with the moment of transfer.
I don't think so.
It's all right, old friend.
Nyssa, I want you to take the Brigadier back to the Tardis, right to the centre, and keep him there until I give you the all clear. You'll be quite safe.
Amazing. The Brigadier's timing. A millisecond either way and
At the moment of transfer, the power didn't come from me.
Well, from the Tardis, really. The two Brigadiers just shorted out the time differential.
Yes, that's right. Zap.
You're as good as new.
I am a Time Lord.
They would have travelled for the rest of time, Tegan. Death was all they wanted. Come on, we must get the Brigadier back to 1977.
Come on.
The ship is dying with the mutants.
Yes. Hurry.
One has to move with the times. How are you feeling?
There we are, 1983. Back to school, Brigadier.
Goodbye.
Turlough. He left in the capsule.
I think you already have.

Jo! Jo! Jo!
Jo.
Oh. Oh, I must have been dreaming.
Yes. Volcanoes and earthquakes.
Thank you. I enjoyed that.
Oh, no. No, that'll have to wait. No, this is far more important. It might make all the difference the next time he turns up.
The Master, of course. Jo, now listen to me. I want you to find out as quickly as possible if there have been any volcanic eruptions or severe earthquakes recently. It doesn't matter where. Anywhere in the world.
Believe me, this is no matter for jokes.
Does it say anything about a crystal?
Mmm.
It was in my dream, Jo. There was a large crystal, shaped like a trident.
Mmm?
No, not now, Jo. I'm busy.
Oh?
Thera. It doesn't mean a thing to me.
Oh, let's forget all about it, Jo, shall we? I just had a nightmare, that's all.
What?
Yes, I heard what you said, but you said Atlantis. Why Atlantis?
Give me that map, Captain Yates.
Of course. Of course.
Jo, get me the Brigadier, will you?
Yes, now.
Hello, Brigadier? It's the Doctor here. Now listen to me. I want you to put out a world wide warning. Alert all your precious UNIT HQ's, not that it'll do any good.
The Master. I've just seen him.
In a dream. Not half an hour ago.
Priority Z one hundred and forty four, I suppose?
Look, I tell you, Brigadier, there is grave danger.
Well, I'm not sure, but in my dream I quite clearly saw
No, I can't go anywhere at the moment. I'm far too busy.
No, certainly not, Jo. I shall need you here with me.
Transmission Of Matter Through Interstitial Time.
Extraordinary. I could have sworn I'd told you. It's a time sensor.
Do you? Well, what's it do then?
Mmm hmm?
Well done, Jo. You're learning. Exactly what you need if you happen to be looking for a Tardis.
Or any other time machine, for that matter. So, if the Master turns up again
As you so rightly say, Bingo.
No, no. You just keep your eye on those dials.
Well of course it's working. Now make a note of the readings, will you?
Thank you.
Oh, that's Venusian feet.
Oh yeah, much larger. Always tripping over themselves, the Venusians. Good, that's good.
Mmm?
I certainly didn't. why?
That's impossible unless
Another Tardis!
Now, I put it somewhere in that sector there. Anything between fifty and a hundred miles from here.
No, not unless he switches his Tardis on again.
If we were a bit nearer and in Bessie.
Do stop wiffling, Jo, there's a good girl. We're not out on a pleasure jaunt, you know?
Only, if it is the Master, we can't run the risk of losing him. You just keep your eye on the time sensor.
Yeah?
What's the bearing?
Well, that's Venusian miles. In Earth miles, that's be about seventy two point seven nine. Let's take a look at the map. Well, we're about here. That should put us somewhere around there. A village called Wootton.
TOM-TIT? Well, if the Master's behind that. What time's the demonstration?
We've got to stop it. Hang on tight, Jo.
Nonsense! It's perfectly safe. My reactions are ten times faster than yours. Bessie's no ordinary car, remember?
See what I mean?
Well, the brakes work by the absorption of inertia, including yours.
Right, come on, Bessie, old girl. It's up to you now.
Right, Jo. Jo?
Oh, good grief.
Cut the power!
Then reverse the polarity!
Reverse the temporal polarity!
Who is this?
Twenty five? This man's eighty or more.
On the contrary, Jo, I think we're just in time.
Well, what he needs at the moment is rest. We'll get him to the hospital later. He must have been a pretty tough youngster.
Well, lucky for him. Otherwise the shock of the change would have finished him off.
Yes, he'll survive.
No, it was more than that.
Well, that's more like it, Jo, but it still isn't the answer, even if the metabolic rate had increased a hundredfold.
Well, of course it is. Even if it wasn't, the change in him would have taken seven or eight months, not eight seconds.
And that is?
Congratulations, Brigadier. I think you've provided the explanation.
The passing of time. That's the only possible answer. Stuart's own personal time speeded up so enormously that his whole physiological life passed by in a moment. But why? How did it happen?
Thascales. Really, the arrogance of that man is beyond belief.
Perhaps a classical education would have helped you, Brigadier. Thascales is a Greek word.
Right, Jo.
No, no, let him talk. Who did you see, Stuart? Answer me.
Look, answer me, Stuart. Who did you see?
Be quiet, both of you. Now answer me. Who did you see? Answer me!
Kronos! Yes, of course. I should have known. Doctor Ingram, I want you to come with me. I want you to tell me everything that you know about that machine of yours.
No, no, you stay here with Stuart. Phone me immediately he starts talking again.
Brigadier, don't hang about. I have a job for you too, you know.
Any trouble?
Good, good.
Because I must find out whether I'm right, that's why. Now where's the crystal?
The crystal of Kronos. So I am right.
Well, it'll be difficult to accept, I warn you.
Well, luckily you are already familiar with the idea of stepping outside of space-time.
And I've lived with it for many long years. I've been there.
Yes, I have. Strange place it is, too. A place that is no place. A dangerous place where creatures love beyond your wildest imagination. Kronovores, time eaters. They swallow a life as quickly as a boa constrictor can swallow a rabbit, fur and all.
I am. The most fearsome of the lot.
Yes, exactly. And what's more, one of those children in the legend was Poseidon, the god of Atlantis.
Well, yes and no. Extraordinary people, the Atlanteans, you know. Even more extraordinary than their cousins in Athens. Once reality became unbearable for them, they would invent a legend to tame it.
Quite so. Kronos, a living creature, was drawn at a time by the priests of Atlantis, using that crystal as its centre.
It is, and your friend the professor, is trying to use that crystal, as it was used four thousand years ago, to capture the Kronavore.
Not just danger to our world, Sergeant, or even our galaxy, but to the entire created universe.
There are two things I don't quite understand, though. One is the massive power build up that you had, and the second is the strength of the signal that I received on the time sensor.
Yes, indeed it does. The strength of the signal was far too strong for an apparatus as crude as this. However. Ah.
Yes. Well, I thought it would be around here somewhere.
This, Sergeant, is the Master's Tardis.
Logically, it just shouldn't happen.
Yes, indeed it did. So, there's only one thing left for us to do. Wouldn't you agree, Sergeant?
Switch on, and take a look for ourselves.
It's reading ten already.
Sergeant, now you're a strong young man. Go in there and pick up that crystal, will you?
It's perfectly safe at this low level. Believe me.
I do.
No, it isn't, you know. You can see it isn't.
No. No, of course you can't. And do you know why you can't shift it? Because that crystal isn't really here at all. It's made the jump through interstitial time. It must to be linked to that other crystal all those thousands of years ago. Or rather it is the other crystal.
Where do you think? In Atlantis, of course.
All right. Tell her that I'm on my way. You'd better stay here, Sergeant.
Coming, Ruth? Er, Doctor Ingram?
Go on, old chap. Go on, you're doing fine.
Why did you say Kronos?
How did you know?
It's a race memory. We all have them.
Later, Jo, later. Go on, Stuart, what else?
I'm sorry, Stuart. I just don't know. But I promise you that we'll do everything we possibly can to help you.
Rest. That's all you need at the moment, until your body recovers from the shock.
Are you sure he said he was from Atlantis?
Brigadier, wait!
A massive feedback of time. Jo, it's too late. Kronos is coming.
Just as I thought. They've run right into trouble. Jo, you stay here.
She'll be all right now she's outside the limit.
There's really no time to explain now. Benton, take the chair. Everybody inside. Quick.
Thank you.
Nothing at all. There's nothing to be done except wait.
Speaking personally, I'd love a cup of tea. How about it, Stuart?
A great deal. For instance, you, Brigadier, you were caught in a hiatus in time. Being without becoming. An ontological absurdity.
Well, you wouldn't be aware of it, of course, because your time had slowed down too.
Yes, so it would seem. After all, it did make a crack in time, didn't it?
Yes, exactly. We're bound to experience all kinds of freak side effects.
Correct.
No, thank you. Jo?
Well, you stand right under a fountain, you don't necessarily get wet, do you?
Me? Collecting.
Well, he must be stopped.
Because we can't even find out what he's up to without the Tardis. A bottle. I need a bottle.
No, no, that won't do. One with a narrow neck. A wine bottle.
Yes, that'll do nicely.
Fine. And the cork?
Well done.
Delaying tactics, Brigadier. A small fly in the Master's metaphorical ointment.
Do give me a fork, Jo, will you?
Right. So far, so good.
You're a philistine, Brigadier. It's not meant to be anything. It just is. I hope.
No, certainly not. It's a time flow analogue.
The relationships between the different molecular bonds and the actual shapes form a crystalline structure of ratios.
Patience, Brigadier, patience. Now then, here goes.
Oh dear.
Well, it doesn't work.
Thank you. Tea! Yes, of course. Tea leaves.
Tea leaves.
Right, here we go.
Well, it's just like jamming a radio signal, Jo. We used to make them at school to spoil each other's time experiments.
Ah, well. It was fun while it lasted.
Believe me, Brigadier, this is no kind of a joke. This is deadly serious.
Well, don't you see? Roundheads? Horsemen in armour? The Master's using that crystal to bring them back in time.
Because it would be suicide to go anywhere without the protection of the Tardis.
We'd better go and fetch it. Come on. Come on, Jo. Brigadier, are you coming?
Do buck up, Lethbridge Stewart.
Mmm?
Never. Why?
Oh, no.
Listen.
Oh yes, it can. Displaced in time, but that's real enough. That's a V1.
A V1, a doodlebug, a buzzbomb. The Germans used them towards the end of the Hitler war.
Jo, out of the car. Get down.
Jo, can you spare me a moment?
Oh, don't worry, Captain. We'll soon have her on her feet again.
Right, Jo, I want you to keep a close eye on this. As soon as you see the slightest reaction, you let me know.
It's very low.
He must be testing before take off. The power drain would have been enormous. Brigadier?
The Master seems to be on the move again.
No, no, there's no time for that now. I'll have to take the Tardis off from down there. I'll use the time sensor as a homing device and put my Tardis inside his. Then wherever he goes, I'll go with him.
Well, goodbye, Lethbridge Stewart.
I'll make contact as soon as possible.
We?
Nothing I can say to dissuade you?
Oh.
Yeah?
Oh, just a spot of redecoration, that's all. Now, Jo, you realise that what I'm about to do is going to be appallingly dangerous.
All right, but you've been warned.
Thank you. Right. Now then, come over here and look at this.
Now, the two Tardis's are operating on the same frequency, you see? Now here comes the tricky part. You see this?
This is the time setting. Now it's critical to a billionth part of a nanosecond, do you see?
Now hold this. (the time detector) If it's infinitesimally low, we'll miss it entirely and goes whistling off to heaven knows where. But if it's too high, even by a fraction of a moment, whumph! Time ram.
Yes. You see, the atoms making up this Tardis would occupy precisely the same space and time as the atoms making up the Master's Tardis.
Yes, well of course it is. So what do you think would happen?
Yes, exactly. Extinction. Utter annihilation. Now do you still want to come?
Glad to have you aboard, Miss Grant.
Ah ha. Yes. Yes, so far, so good.
Well, that's the curious thing. No time at all. We're outside time. Of course, it always seems to take a long time but that depends upon the mood, I suppose.
No, no, no, hers. No, the Tardis's.
It depends what you mean by alive, doesn't it. You take old Bessie, for instance. Right, coming in to land now, Jo.
Steady.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Still, that was always on the cards. I suppose.
Yes, quite. Very curious effect that. I wonder how it happened? Jo, switch on the monitor, will you? Let's see where we are.
Well, that's strange. No, of course. We're seeing through the TOM-TIT gap into the time vortex. Jo, you wait right here.
Good grief. Jo, come out here a moment, will you?
No? Follow me.
Well, it's perfectly simple, Jo. My Tardis is inside the Master's.
Exactly. They're both inside each other. Yeah, I should have suspected that.
Three guesses?
Right first time!
We're on our way, Jo. The Master's taken off for Atlantis.
It's because the Tardis is operating out of phase, that's why.
That's calmed her down a bit. She's very temperamental when she's roused, isn't she.
Sorry about your coccyx, Jo, but these little things are sent to try us.
Coccyx. Your tailbone.
Well, I thought we might have a little chat.
One step outside my Tardis and that would be the end of me, wouldn't it?
You've noticed. Well, well, well.
Do you think that I haven't thought of that too? You're as trapped as I am. You couldn't even open that door of yours unless I wish it.
Do you really think I care what happens to me at the moment? Don't you realise that your plans could ru
He's not even listening. He's turned the sound off.
We've got to make him listen. It's our only chance of stopping him.
No, not if I can help it.
If he's turned his sound receiver off, I must make myself heard without it.
If the thraskin puts his fingers in his ears, it is polite to shout. That's an old Venusian proverb.
Thraskin? Oh, it's an archaic word, seldom used since the twenty fifth dynasty, the modern equivalent is plinge.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Jo, I've just told you. It means thraskin.
Testing, testing, testing. One, two, three, four, five, testing.
Yes, and he can't turn me off, can you? You've got to listen to me now.
Obviously, you've not as yet been able to bring Kronos through, otherwise you wouldn't be going to Atlantis, so perhaps there's still time to make you realise the folly of your
Inyups senupwat. Neas nees nig datdat sig. Ilshnimuwat ijnilguin nyup nyp
Il shneel nukcusnok drashtarnik dag. Of all the low, underhanded tricks!
English.
Yes, but backwards.
Well, he's picking up my words even before I've spoken them and feeding them back to me through the Tardis's telepathic circuits, making them come out backwards.
Yes, of course. How else do you think they communicate? Well, that decides it. I've got no option. Now listen to me, Jo. When I go out there, I want you to
What else can I do?
Well, I've got to risk it. He's got to be stopped, but that's no reason to put you into any danger. Now once I go out of that door, I want you to close it, all right?
Yes, and you'll be safely locked in. Now, you're not to open that door for anybody or anything until I say so.
Jo, you'll do as you're told! It's your job, remember?
Yes, I know, Jo, I know. Now go and open that door.
Won't you introduce me?
Greetings to you, Krasis. Any friend of the Master's is an enemy of mine.
Yes, I most certainly have.
You're risking the total destruction of the entire cosmos.
You're mad! Paranoid!
Jo. Jo, are you in there?
Thank heavens you're alive.
I'm nowhere, Jo. I'm still in the time vortex. The Tardis is relaying my thoughts to you.
What other voices? Oh. Oh, those are my subconscious thoughts. But I shouldn't listen to them too hard if I were you. I'm not all that proud of some of them.
Oh, you can't, Jo, but luckily the Tardis can. That's why she's put us in touch.
Well, go to control panel number three.
Now, lift the little lid marked Extreme Emergency.
The one with the red handle inside?
All right, Jo. Pull it.
Hello, Jo.
There we are, Jo. On our way to Atlantis.
No, not entirely, but the time sensor will lead us to where the Master's Tardis is.
No, I hope not. Not this time. But we'll soon find out.
Well, well, well. Isn't it a small world.
Yes, so it would seem.
We've come here to warn you that
Good afternoon. Now where have I seen that face before? Can't think of anything to say?
This is Jo, Jo Grant, your Majesty.
You'll be all right.
Nevertheless, he did save our lives, your Majesty.
Well, why didn't you destroy the crystal?
Yes, of course. It's just like the Tardis. It has its being outside time and its appearance is here.
Well, if wisdom is to seek the truth, I am, yes.
Yes, but who is the guardian?
Well, it's a harmless enough ambition, I should have thought?
He's the minotaur.
It doesn't matter. Please go on.
What?
Sorry to hold you up like this, Krasis, but I need that key.
Jo? Jo? Jo? Jo, where are you?
Toro!
Look out, Jo!
I'm afraid he's dead, Jo. The crystal! It's the crystal of Kronos!
There you, Jo. That's what all the fuss has been about.
Well, cheer up, Jo. Now that we've found the crystal, the Master's little game is at an end.
That's where you're mistaken, Krasis. And if you value your own life, you will take me to see the King. Now!
Does he really?
What happened to King Dalios?
Then he's still alive?
You don't mean to say that you still intend going ahead with this
I wouldn't count on that.
Any luck?
Well, we'll just have to play it by ear, won't we.
Well, the whole of creation is very delicately balanced in cosmic terms, Jo. If the Master opens the floodgates of Kronos' power, all order and all structure will be swept away, and nothing will be left but chaos.
I felt like that once when I was young. It was the blackest day of my life.
Ah, well, that's another story. I'll tell you about it one day. The point is, that day was not only my blackest, it was also my best.
Well, when I was a little boy, we used to live in a house that was perched halfway up the top of a mountain. And behind our house, there sat under a tree an old man, a hermit, a monk. He'd lived under this tree for half his lifetime, so they said, and he'd learned the secret of life. So, when my black day came, I went and asked him to help me.
Well, I'm coming to that, Jo, in my own time. Ah, I'll never forget what it was like up there. All bleak and cold, it was. A few bare rocks with some weeds sprouting from them and some pathetic little patches of sludgy snow. It was just grey. Grey, grey, grey. Well, the tree the old man sat under, that was ancient and twisted and the old man himself was, he was as brittle and as dry as a leaf in the autumn.
Nothing, not a word. He just sat there, silently, expressionless, and he listened whilst I poured out my troubles to him. I was too unhappy even for tears, I remember. And when I'd finished, he lifted a skeletal hand and he pointed. Do you know what he pointed at?
A flower. One of those little weeds. Just like a daisy, it was. Well, I looked at it for a moment and suddenly I saw it through his eyes. It was simply glowing with life, like a perfectly cut jewel. And the colours? Well, the colours were deeper and richer than you could possibly imagine. Yes, that was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen.
Yes, I laughed too when I first heard it. So, later, I got up and I ran down that mountain and I found that the rocks weren't grey at all, but they were red, brown and purple and gold. And those pathetic little patches of sludgy snow, they were shining white. Shining white in the sunlight. You still frightened, Jo?
That's good. I'm sorry I brought you to Atlantis.
Thank you.
Dalios! Dalios!
Is the Master responsible for this?
What is it?
Dalios! We won't fail you, Dalios.
Quite above himself, isn't he.
What happened to the rest of the council?
Are they alive?
Then satisfy my curiosity now. Are they indeed alive, or are they dead like King Dalios?
The King is dead, Madame.
And you were responsible for his death!
No, stop him! Stop him!
He'll never obey you. Don't you understand yet what you've done? He's uncontrollable!
Jo! Jo, come back! Jo! Jo!
Come back, Jo! Come back! Jo! Come back.
Don't worry, Jo.
I'll soon sort him out for you.
By making you see reason, and making you destroy that crystal.
Ah, but there's one card that you've forgotten.
The trump card. I can stop you whenever I please.
Am I? How about time ram?
The two Tardis's are operating on the same frequency, and our controls are locked together. See for yourself.
You know what'll happen if that control goes over the safety limit, don't you. Tell him, Jo.
Do you?
Top of the class. Extinction, total annihilation, for you, the Tardis and the crystal.
Oh yes, of course. But by then, Kronos will be free, and the universe will be saved.
What?
Very well. Goodbye, Jo.
To give you one last chance.
But Jo, there may be another way.
Don't do it!
Jo. Are you all right?
Dead? What are you talking about? You're no more dead than I am.
And I suppose we're all in heaven?
Yes. Yes, it's fascinating, but somehow I don't think we're in heaven.
Well, that's just it. I don't know myself. You shouldn't have put us into time ram, Jo. In any case, I was just about to do it myself.
Now look, Jo, I. No, not really.
Greetings.
You know me?
Well, you must forgive me, but I can't quite place you.
Where exactly are we?
Yes, the time ram.
Well, what now?
In the Tardis.
Thank you.
Mighty Kronos, may I ask one last favour of you?
His life. His freedom.
Yes, I know. But would you allow us to deal with him in our way?
Don't thank me. You're coming back to Earth with us.
No! No! Kronos, stop him! Stop him, Kronos!
Jo, would you condemn anybody to an eternity of torment? Even the Master?
No. Well, neither would I. Even though he was responsible for the destruction of Atlantis.
Yes. Right, Jo, we're about to land back in Cambridge. Just think. It all happened three thousand, five hundred years ago.
What's going on here?
It seems to be working a bit too well.
It's done its job. Everything's now back to normal.
A very good question, Brigadier.

Hmm?
You're a little late, Peri. It's about a billion years since there was any sea on Androzani Minor.
Come on. Well, well, well. The old place hasn't changed at all. Still nothing but sand.
What?
Almost, anyway. It's fused silica. And I'm not a pain. Here's some more. Now, why would anyone come here?
These patches were fused by the rocket pads of a spacecraft. Too small for interstellar travel, so it obviously came from the twin planet of Androzani Major. The interesting question is, why?
Hmm. Sarcasm is not your strong point, Peri. If I were you I'd stick. Ah-ha! What have we here?
A monoskid. You can see the deep furrow where it left the ship then the shallower one when it returned.
No, no, no. You can see where the light track sometimes crosses the heavy one. So, someone came here with a heavily laden monoskid, unloaded it somewhere and then returned to the ship.
Er, one moment. Looks as if the tracks lead to those caves over there.
Ah, blow holes.
Now we're near you can see they're not caves, they're blow holes.
Not to a speleologist. And not if you're stuck in one of those things at high tide.
It's a figure of speech. You see, the core of this planet is superheated primeval mud. When its orbit takes it close to Androzani Major, the gravitational pull
Hmm. Presumably why the planet was never colonised. Androzani Major was becoming quite developed the last time I passed this way.
I don't remember. I'm pretty sure it wasn't the future.
I tried keeping a diary once. Not chronological, of course, but the trouble with time travel is one never seems to find the time.
Hmm? Oh, natural phosphorescence. There's a crystalline material in these walls. It's polished smooth as glass.
Be careful not to slip. Oh.
Keep still. All right, give me your hand. Come on, up.
It's not edible, by the smell of it. It's probably quite harmless.
Yes, well, don't fall into any more, hmm?
Does it offend you?
Safety precaution. I'm allergic to certain gases in the praxis range of the spectrum.
If the gas is present, the celery turns purple.
I eat the celery. If nothing else, I'm sure it's good for my teeth.
Gas carbines.
Poison volatisers. Nasty little objects, aren't they. There are enough hand weapons here to equip a small army.
I was wrong. This dice is still warm.
Boots coming this way. Quickly, over here.
Surrender.
Couldn't we have a chair? It's been a rather strenuous day.
May I ask who you are, sir?
Well done, sir. I suppose you started in the ranks.
Sir.
Couldn't put it more plainly. Exactly how do we cooperate?
Thank you.
Sorry.
Well, I am generally known as the Doctor. My young friend here is known as Peri, that is, Perpegillium Brown.
You know, if we could just sit down and talk about this little misunderstanding in a civilised manner. My young friend here has been complaining of pains in her legs. You can see for yourself she's suffering from some sort of urticaria.
Come to that, I don't feel too well myself.
Tempers getting a little frayed, are they?
And you are?
And we are to address you as sir?
You take orders from a civilian? Weren't you telling us you command Federal forces here?
We're quite innocent, you know. This is all a mistake.
Afraid not.
Doesn't sound any more enticing than any other form of death.
There was something very funny about that Major.
Chellak said they were fighting android rebels.
Yes, do try and speak English, Peri, hmm?
Yes, that's another odd thing. He had us paraded up and down in front of him, then once he'd seen us he seemed to lose all interest. I find that rather insulting.
I've really no idea. I'm sorry I got you into this, Peri.
Yes, I should never have followed those tracks. Curiosity's always been my downfall. How's your rash, by the way?
Me too. That fungus obviously had some very toxic properties.
No. It's like a graveyard.
Morgus said that Spectrox was the most valuable substance in the universe. I wonder what it can be?
Ah, not quite. It's going to worry me until I find out what it is.
Nothing special. We're innocent, we've had no trial, we've had no opportunity to defend ourselves. In short, this is a mockery of justice.
Ahem.
Sharaz Jek, I presume.
Thank you.
No.
We travel a lot.
Really. Well of course it would be fascinating to stay and talk, but actually once we've rested, if you could just point us towards the surface?
What is the matter?
Try touching your toes. That's it. And again.
Salateen? We've not met him yet. Where's he chained up?
Thank you.
What do you say, Peri? We can go on nature walks, have picnics and jolly evenings round the camp fire.
Thank you.
He means it will seem like forever.
Well, now we know why Spectrox is the most valuable substance in the universe.
Until the army take it away from you.
Exactly. This General is working to a plan. I've seen his operations board.
So, they've already sealed you off to the north.
Oh, what's five years when you're having a good war?
And a raving egoist. Said my mind was nearly the equal of his. Incredible conceit.
Not just Morgus, probably one amongst a vast majority. Ah, Salateen. I'd know you anywhere. I'm the Doctor, this is
Yes, well, I've been looking forward to this meeting.
Well, fellow prisoners. How long have you been here?
That's right. You see, you're an old lag, Salateen. You know the ropes.
And you probably know the best way out of here.
You mean you don't, or you won't tell us.
Do you detect a certain coolness?
Kill you? Ow!
Cramp, same as you had.
A Spectrox nest? If you mean a large fuzzy, sticky ball
Oh, marvellous sense of humour. Try not to get hysterical. What do you mean, we're dying?
What's the cure?
What is a Spectrox nest?
We haven't seen any bats.
Well, don't keep us in suspense.
What else? You said, for a start.
This delightful process you describe so graphically, how long does it all take?
Can't waste any more time here.
How do these belt plates work?
Yes, probably they emit some low frequency magna waves or even a neutrino pattern keyed to the android's spectrum length.
Something.
Nearly perfect.
What happens now?
Well, if you have to go to arbitration, I have had some experience.
Emotional sort of fellow.
What happened?
More of a tennis player than a cricketer.
I see. Well, Peri, I think it's time we were toddling along.
Well, let's take a look.
Hmm. The androids are programmed to kill humans. Well, my physiology is quite different. The question is, will it know that?
Sorry, Peri, no alternative. Just keep back.
Hello.
What a clever little android you are. Now, we'll just cut your solenoids.
Won't hurt a bit.
It's all right, you can come out now.
Yes, well, never mind. It's all over now. Ah, what have we here? This might be useful if we come across any more androids.
To find the queen bat.
We'll collect some oxygenators from the Tardis. Come along.
First of all, we need to find our way to the Tardis.
Peri? Peri, where are you? Peri! Salateen! Peri! Peri!
Life often springs these little surprises.
I don't know. Maybe they just liked my face?
I wish I knew.
I don't know. We got into a shoot-out with one of your androids and then she disappeared.
I think she's with Salateen.
If they have, it's round two to the army, I'd say.
What's that?
My legs are going numb. I suppose that's stage three.
I believe it's called Spectrox toxaemia.
Yes.
Why don't you leave me here to die?
Are you afraid of intruders?
Something wrong with his face, or mine?
Ah, I thought I recognised the voice.
I'm not acting for anyone. I was just passing through. I happened to get mixed up in this pathetic little local war.
I am telling the truth. I keep telling the truth. Why is it no one believes me?
How do you know it was faked? Maybe they were just bad shots.
Autohold, off. That's it. Now, vertical descent pattern.
Ah, Stotzy, have you had a good rest?
Sorry, seems to be locked.
Stotzy, we'll be touching down in a couple of minutes, or more likely crashing down. You see, I'm a bit out of practice with manual landings, so if I were you, I'd find something firm to hang on to!
Why?
Not a very persuasive argument actually, Stotz, because I'm going to die soon anyway. Unless, of course
Unless, of course, I can find the antidote. I owe it to my friend to try because I got her into this. So you see, I'm not going to let you stop me now!
Sorry, Peri. I can't make it.
Not enough time.
Oxygen. No time. I must find Peri.
Jek, how is she?
I know.
Come on, Peri.
That's more like it.
No, no, Peri, don't give up. You mustn't give up!
Celery. It's a powerful restorative where I come from. Unfortunately, the human olfactory system is comparatively feeble. Jek, you know this cure Professor Jackij discovered?
It's her only chance. Jek, do you know where the queen bats are?
I'm going down. Now, show me the route.
I can store oxygen for several minutes, Jek. Now, you must do everything you can to keep her temperature down until I get back.
Thank you.
It's not your lucky day, either.
Peri? Peri, can you hear me? Open your mouth. You must drink this.
Is this death?
Peri, I see Professor Jackij knew his stuff. Good old Jackij.
Contains an anti-vesicant, I imagine. Interesting.
What?
Finished. Only enough for you.
Too late, Peri. Going soon. Time to say goodbye.
I might regenerate. I don't know.
Feels different this time.
Adric?
You're expecting someone else?
That's three I's in one breath. Makes you sound a rather egotistical young lady.
Change, my dear. And it seems not a moment too soon.

No, nothing to speak of. The counter's hardly reading anything. Shall we take a look?
Oh, but I have.
Well, at the moment it's temporarily hors de combat.
Yes, I don't think, I don't see why not. There's nothing, no danger about. Come on. Let's go and have a look.
What?
Well, let's go outside and have a look.
No, impossible in this temperature. Besides, it's too warm.
Oh, no, no. Not at the moment, child. However inviting that water looks, we don't know what sort of creatures might be lurking beneath its surface.
I say, what do you make of this, Chesterton? Fascinating.
Yes, it is, isn't it. Yes. Glass instead of sand, eh? Intriguing, intriguing, my boy.
Or was the glass put here deliberately, and if so, why, hmm?
Sea of acid. Astonishing. You know, in all my travels I've never come across anything like this before. However, Susan wasn't harmed, anyway.
Yes, and if you'd had your shoes on, my boy, you could have lent her hers. You mustn't get sloppy in your habits, you know. Good gracious.
Under acid, more likely.
Oh, yes, it has occurred to me. Let's see what it is. Help me get this top off.
Yes?
See that crack along there? It's where the acid must have seeped in.
Use that, use that.
Yes, and whatever it was wore it, is similar to a human being, hmm?
Yes, well, I think we ought to go back to the ship and try and find Susan. She should have caught up with us by now. Come along.
Good! Now perhaps we might learn who it is that uses these strange ships. Anyway, lets get back to the ship and find Susan. Later, perhaps, a little visiting, I think.
Oh, wretched child. Now where's she got to, I wonder?
Yes, sand here and glass on the beach. I'm beginning to think that sea of acid is a defence barrier.
Yes, it would seem so.
Yes, yes.
Yes, now before you two get carried away, I think we'd better go and find Susan, hmm?
Excellent. Now I suggest we go different ways and meet back at the furthermost point, which is probably round the corner there somewhere. Off you go, off you go now.
Yes, yes. From what Susan has described, he was wearing a suit similar to the one we found on the beach.
No, no. The man wearing the monk's habit lives in this building.
Yes, with one difference, which is puzzling but revealing. They died, and we're only prisoners.
I shouldn't worry too much about that. That young schoolmaster friend of yours is very resourceful. Whilst he's free, our chance of rescue is still good.
Yes, yes. I want to know more about this planet. Your technology, you say, reached its peak over two thousand years ago?
I see. And in that case it was possible to eliminate evil from the minds of men for all time.
When they're replaced it would mean that your machine is irresistible and you can overcome and control the Voords again.
I'm coming, child. Don't rush, I'm coming. Well, don't just stand there, come along, come along. Keeping me waiting.
What?
I don't know. I don't know. There's no substance here. Have a look round the side, child. Go along.
Is it a circular barrier?
No, of course, there wouldn't be. The molecules would be at their weakest. Ha! It's fascinating, Chesterton. Yes, I've got it, I've got it. You know, I think a force barrier has been put up around the ship.
I know we have no choice, but this whole affair is outrageous. Blackmail, pure and simply blackmail.
And another thing. If you think I'm going to travel across that acid sea in one of these primitive submersibles, you're very much mistaken.
Oh, really.
Oh don't be ridiculous, my boy. This is a perfectly acceptable method of travel. Very compact and very neat, sir, if I may say. Yes.
Oh, how exhilarating.
Yes, I can't imagine why Barbara left of her own free will.
It seems there's only one conclusion. What ever it is that's behind that door must have taken her by force.
No, no, no, no. Don't let us be precipitous.
Very well, but I say I'm sure it's a mistake.
Oh, sensuous and decadent, but rather pleasant. I say, is that a pomegranate?
Extraordinary.
It's all most remarkable.
Truffles. I do believe they're truffles. Well, well.
So is his kitchen. Delicious.
Susan.
Susan, I will not have you take advantage
Well, er, yes, perhaps, but I'm afraid it's not quite as easy as giving Susan a dress out of that.
Well, perhaps, if I had to choose, a well equipped laboratory with every conceivable instrument. Yes. Yes.
Hmm. Well, we shall look forward to that.
Charming young man. Yes, charming. I think a study of this culture is going to prove very, very fascinating. Oh, dear me. I'm tired, you know.
Most refreshing.
Look at these exquisite glasses, Chesterton.
Now, now, child. Don't take it all. We must leave some for Barbara when she wakes up.
What's the matter, hmm?
No, there's nothing there. I only mentioned it because I have rather a sore spot here myself.
I don't think she's properly awake. Susan, get me a glass of that fruit juice, will you?
Here, drink this.
Now you've broken it.
This is going to test our host's patience, you know. It's one of a set.
What's happened to her?
Ah, here comes Altos. Now perhaps he can convince you.
Yes, yes, well, naturally we're all glad that she's going to be all right, so if there's nothing more we can do for her, I suggest we get a look at the laboratory, hmm?
I think I shall find considerable scope here.
What? Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. A simple toy. I'm sure that will amuse you. Ah, now this might be helpful.
Yes, if I can have instruments like these, I might be able to overcome the fault in the time mechanism aboard the ship.
Seeking their revenge, are they? Poor creatures.
We're all meeting here. She's bringing Sabetha and that young man Altos. I questioned him and there's no doubt about it. He's one of Arbitan's couriers.
Yes. He's going with you, certainly. By the way, I found these travel dials. Those repellant brain things didn't appreciate their significance, fortunately.
I will explain it all in good time. Ah, here are the others.
No, wait. Now, we have one key and there are three more to find.
Good idea.
Well, we must presume something has happened to your friend Eprin.
Ah, yes, the place you mentioned, yes. The highly civilised society. Now then, I've decided to adopt his plan.
Yes, precisely. I shall try and find out what's happened to your friend Eprin. If he's alive, make contact, then we can all meet again.
Yes, Altos has shown me how to adjust mine.
No. I think it better if you travel with the main party, child.
Yes, yes, I know, Susan, but don't you see it's better if we split our forces. You see, it's a very dangerous situation and the sooner we get on with it, the better. For my part, I know you'll be well looked after. And as for me, well, I'm going to a well-ordered society and I think it's the best and speediest way, really.
No.
Say five days.
No, I hope not. Put these on, please.
Oh, of course I will. And you see that you take good care of Susan.
Thank you, my dear. Now off you go.
Goodbye, my child.
Now, quickly. You must go and follow her.
I quite agree with you, my boy.
Yes, so am I, dear child. So am I. However, we have some important work to attend to. Excuse me. Chesterton, you and I must have a talk.
I am that man.
Yes, I have studied some, my Lord.
Thank you.
My Lords, I cannot defend a man when I have not considered every aspect of the case. I must have time to examine witnesses, read statements and to prepare my case.
Thank you, my Lord.
Thank you.
We shall see.
I've been starting and studying their laws ever since I heard that Eprin had been murdered.
Oh, yes, I had met him and arranged to take the micro-key, but something must have happened. That's why he tried to take the key earlier than we'd arranged.
Yes. He must have told his plans to someone else and that someone else killed him and took the key.
Yes, we shall need every minute of that. Now, we must all take a task on. Murder, I gather, is very rare here. Now, I want both of you to go to the library and find out all the case histories you can. Facts and figures.
Yes, yes, quite. Now, off you go, both of you, and meet me back here in three hours.
Well, you, my child, and Barbara, can be my detectives. And you, my friend.
Trust me.
Oh, come now, Tarron. We're not dealing in magic, you know. It's obvious to me the key must have been taken from this room.
Then would you mind telling us what happened after the alarm bell went, please?
Precisely, and I rather gather when we discover its location we shall also discover the real identity of the murderer.
Mister Tarron, I wonder if you'd mind leaving us alone for a few moments. We'd like to discuss the aspects of this case.
Thank you.
Yes, well, hmm.
What?
Oh, well, elementary, elementary.
All in good time, my child. The important is I believe I know who did the killing.
You see, Tarron never doubted that Chesterton was guilty. A grave error. Yes, a very grave error.
Precisely. But someone did it, and we also know there was a third man in the room. How he got in here we shall know in a moment. Now let us assume he was hiding. Yes. Behind this door. Now, Barbara, you imagine that you are Chesterton for a moment. Come here. Now please, you look into the room, you see a body on the floor. What do you do?
Good. Right, now let me see you do it. There's a weapon beside the body. Do you examine it?
Good. Then you look up in front of you and you see exactly what you came here for, the micro-key. Unbeknown to you, the third man comes out of hiding, creeps up behind you, and you are struck down, so. Now, he could take what he came here for. He opens the case, lifts the key, the alarm bell sounds. Now, he only has a few seconds so he conceals the key, runs to the door, opens it, gets out and then closes it. But he can't go any further because already the security guards and officials are on their way. So he decides to pretend that he is first on the scene!
Yes.
Yes, he went in, killed his colleague, heard Chesterton in the hall, hid behind the door and the rest we know.
My dear child, this is only a theory. We must have proof.
If Tarron were to know that now, his case against Chesterton would be complete. I can't prove at this very moment that Chesterton didn't hide in its present location.
I have a little errand for you, and I think you will find it very, very interesting.
My Lords, let me begin by saying that the murderer is without any doubt in this chamber. The trouble is, he's not under arrest, but my young friend here is.
I can, my Lord. You will know his identity in a moment. I will now call my first witness. Thank you.
This, my Lords, is a reproduction of the stolen micro-key. Do you recognise this, young lady?
And do you know where it is now?
Then please tell the tribunal where its present location is.
Where did you get it?
Is he here?
Then please point him out to us.
And so you see, my Lords, when Sabetha was showing the court the micro-key, it wasn't in actual fact the one that was stolen from the vault.
Yes, my Lord, and we returned to find the last one. Then they would all be returned to Arbitan.
Oh, come now. Surely you don't think that he's still guilty? I admit that I resorted to a subterfuge when Sabetha accused Ayden of taking the key, but I think the results justifies the means.
Yes, my Lord.
I beg the indulgence of the tribunal, and ask for time to produce new evidence.
Hmm? Oh, it's you.
Yes, and you did an even better job for the prosecution, my man.
Yes, yes.
Goodbye.
Leave? I can't leave now. I must find new evidence and re-open the case.
Perhaps not, perhaps not. However, child, you're safe and well. I wish I could say the same thing about Chesterton.
I hope so. I sincerely hope so. Well? Well!
Ah. Then you can stay the execution.
Impossible!
What else did he say?
Collect the key. Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Yes, yes. You understand? The villain that planned all this, the one who planned this whole affair, is now planning to collect the key! What a wonderful opportunity it gives us to catch him red-handed. And to release Chesterton!
You!
It had to be. I knew it all along. Until we knew the culprit, the information was no good.
You should read Pyrrho, my boy. He founded Scepticism. A great asset to your business.
Reading? What are you talking about? I met the man.
There was no point in keeping them here, so I thought it might cheer Arbitan up to know that we'd been successful.
Ah, is that the authorisation?
All we need now is the wrist strap you impounded from Chesterton.
Our means of travel.
Show him.
Well, one of them might have waited for me. However, I suppose I'd better join them.
Goodbye, my friends.
What on earth are you doing, dear boy? You frightened the life out of me.
Yes, the forcefield's been lifted, and I peered in for a moment or two. Now, everything appears to be all right.
Yes, well, come along, come along. You're all running around here like a lot of scared chickens.
I'm here! My dear Chesterton, sometimes you drive me round the bend. I don't know
Yes, and I think it's time now to go back to the ship.
Here, and don't part with it until you're absolutely sure it goes into the right hands.
And you accompany me, my dear, will you?
Yes, yes.
So when Yartek gets the final key, his power will be absolute.
And our impulse to leave this planet would be destroyed.
You heard about Arbitan?
Give me the key. We must have it destroyed.
What! You gave it away?
My dear boy!
There's not a moment to loose. Come on!
To the moving wall!
About where you are, Susan.
Somewhere here. Somewhere here. There's a small stone. It moved under my hand.
Yes, my child. Chase the others up, will you?
I'm glad to have this moment alone with you, Sabetha. I want to speak of your father. You know, he was a very wise and brilliant man, and I know how you felt when you learned of his death.
No, no, I wouldn't say that. His work will go on, only not quite in the same way. But I don't believe that man was made to be controlled by machines. Machines can make laws, but they cannot preserve justice. Only human beings can do that. Now I only hope that you'll carry on his good work, please. Goodbye. Bless you, my child.
Susan!

DOCTOR is asleep in his chair)
Hmm? Whats the matter? What is it? What is it? Oh good gracious me! Dont tell me I went off to sleep.
Oh!
Deep in the arms of Morpheus, hey my boy? Well, I feel a bit sticky. I must go and have a wash.
Oh, my dear, Im so glad youre feeling better.
Oh, the. Oh my dear, Im so sorry.
What? Oh, I say, I must never allow this sort of thing again now, must we? No. Well, all we have to do is to turn the power off.
Yes, er, excuse me, materialised, I think, is a better word. Well now, lets have a look and see whats doing. Yes, the air's very good. The temperature. Yes, wherever we are, I think its nice and fine. (Yawns) Oh, do pardon me. Forgive me, Im so sorry. Yes. Well, I must say, this looks most promising. Now, lets have a little look shall we?
Yes. It does somewhat. Might be a cave, oreven perhaps underground.
Oh. It doesnt necessarily mean anything my dear Barbara. We can, of course, always travel throughsolid matter in flight and all, again, we can, we can take off again quite easily. No, I do think we ought to step outside and have a look. I will too. Susan, er
Hmm? Yes, yes, yes, my dear. Of course, yes, yes, how silly of me. Yes, number four switch.
Very good, very good. You wont, of course, try to do that during transit, will you?
No, it doesnt my dear. No, no. But I do know that smell.
Yes, yes, more or less. Oh, have a look round, I should, but dont go too far away. Remember we havent had much luck with these caves during our travels.
Oh, I think Im going to have a nap.
Remember I can hear what youre saying. Pick up that stone for me, would you?
Yes.
Thank you.
Oh, my writing gets worse and worse. Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Well, undoubtedly weve landed on the planet Dido. How remarkable. Well, I must say. itll be rather nice to meet these friendly people again after all these years. Fancy landing back here again. I wonder if I were to tell Ian that it was deliberate, whether hed believe me or not? Oh no, of course, I was asleep. Oh, pity, pity, pity.
Chesterton! Chesterton! Where are you, my dear boy? Oh, I cant, oh, I cant see anything.
Chesterton! Oh, my dear fellow, are you all right?
Where is she?
Steady, steady, steady.
Come on, come on, get your breath back. Now, now then, you all right?
well, let's try and look for her, shall we?
Be careful now, be careful. Oh, good gracious, the whole roofs fallen in!
Oh, I hope we shant get another fall. I dont think the Tardis is likely to
What are you talking about, my boy?
With hands and feet like claws?
Well, this is the planet Dido. Ive been here before, I know them very well.
Theyre very friendly people.
Yes.
Oh dont for heavens sake start scratching there. Try and find another way out. This thing, was it armed?
With a big head, resembling a spanner?
Yes.
Yes, that may account for this.
When I was here last time, if I remember rightly, theyd just perfected this thing. Its a ray, used in construction work.
Now look here, what about Barbara, are you all right? Are you capable?
Come along. Dont just sit there, my dear boy, stand up, stand up. Come along, thats it, mind your head. Its only dust. No bones broken.
Yes, its a pity I didnt get that degree, isnt it? Excuse me.
Really. Very friendly people.
Now look here, you take yourself off there and try and find Barbara.
Come along and be careful.
But why? What could have happened to changed them? I wonder.
Oh, I cant understand it. I just cant understand it. Violence is totally alien to people on this planet.
No, no, no, my dear Chesterton, no. All the more reason for people on this planet to hate death and destruction. My dear boy, when I was here before, the, what, the total population amounted to, a handle of people. Merely a hundred.
Yes, exactly. All the more reason for holding onto life. Peace, friendship, happiness. This means everything to the people here.
Me? Carry on? My dear fellow, it was you that stopped.
Whats that, my boy, What? Whats that?
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! I say, look, have you noticed the ledge? Its narrowing out.
Wait, wait.
Point the torch, shine it down there. You see that? Its quite a chasm.
My dear boy, if I pressed myself any harder against this thing I would be doing myself an injury.
Well, its not me, is it. Shine the torch down there!
What
Isnt it sufficient that itits down there and were up here? Hmm?
Oh. Very good, yes. Very intelligent reasoning. So good I might have said the same thing myself.
Well, now, be careful.
Yes.
What?
Chesterton, it's oil. Its got oil on it.
Come back here. Theyve trapped you into pulling this thing out.
Dont go any further!
Take your coat off, my boy, and throw it over the blades.
Right. Now swing yourself round.
Come on, come on, come on.
Ive no idea. Ive never seen it before in my life.
Yes, quite so. Weve got to get this thing back in its place.
Yes, never mind about all that. Come on, give me a hand. Barbaras still outside. She might be in grave danger.
There you are. I think thats got it back. Watch!
Yes, I think youre right. Chesterton!
Oh, right. Look, theres a door.
Now that must lead somewhere.
Yes, but therell be no time to open that. No, come on, let's go the obvious way.
Go on, go on.
Just so long as nobody starts creeping up behind us.
What was that?
What is it?
Barbara!
My dear Barbara!
Oh, Ive never felt better in my life!
Thats better, thats better. Now blow your nose and wipe your face. Thats it. I dont like saying it, my dear, but you do look a bit of a mess, you know.
Now, now, now. Its going to be all right. Were not going to jeopardise your safety or your rescue. Now, first of all, Id like to have a talk with this Mister Bennett of yours.
Will you take me to him?
Yes.
Now, Vicki.
Vicki, my dear. Sit down. You dont mean that, do you? Well, do you? Mmm? Good, good. Now, Ive listened to all youve said and Ive thoroughly understood. Were here to help you. This is all were going to try to do. You know, were not going to ruin things for you.
Yes.
I think I agree with Bennett, at least about Koquillion. But dont you think theres just a chance, just a little chance that my ideas might prove the better ones? Hmm? Good, good. Now, Ill go and have a talk with Mister Bennett and I promise you, Ill listen to everything he says. Hmm?
Splendid.
Yes, well now, I dont think you need to wait, my dear. You go back with Ian and Barbara. Hmm?
Oh, now, now, now, You mustnt be like that. Youre not giving her much of a chance, are you? Shes nice, you know. Youll like her.
Yes, well, so might I have done!
Hmm?
And Barbara has, I suppose. Ay? You know she was frightened, frightened for your safety. She thought you were going to be hurt. Good gracious me, you mustnt behave like that. Now, look here, I think the best thing for you to do is to pop along back there, dont you, hmm? Eh? You must believe what Barbara did, try and understand my dear, and why she did it. Just for me, eh?
Mister Bennett?
I want to talk to you. Oh dear.
What have we here? Tape recordings for what?
Silly child, silly child.
Intercom systems, tape recordings. Now, I wonder what else, hmm?
Yes, I see, an easy way to get out of a locked room.
Come in. Come in, wont you? Ive been waiting to talk to you.
This used to be the Peoples Hall of Judgement. Fitting, in the present circumstances dont you think, hmm? Mister Bennett, may I remind you that masks and robes such as you are wearing are only used on absolutely ceremonial occasions, hmm?
Yes, I had hoped that you would continue. This elaborate plan must have been conceived for some reason. What, hmm?
Get rid of the other crewmembers and blame their deaths on the Dido people, hmm?
You destroyed a whole planet to save your own skin. Youre insane.
If that happened, your guilt would have been hidden forever, hmm?
Oh, Barbara, Ian. Were back in the ship, eh?
Yes, thats, they left me outside.
Oh, er, two strangers. Yes, Bennetts dead. Bennett was Koquillion, you know.
Yes.
The girl, Vicki, now. Did you, did you bring her?
Where?
Oh, I must get some fresh air. Yes, I want to have a talk with that child.
Yes, now dont fuss especially, Im quite all right, my boy. Im quite all right.
Thats about what happened, and thats all.
My dear. My dear, why dont you come with us, hmm?
We can travel anywhere and everywhere in that old box as you call it. Regardless of space and time.
And if you like adventure, my dear, I can promise you an abundance of it. Apart from all that, well youll be amongst friends. Hmm? Well? Now, suppose I leave you here for a moment to think about it, hmm?
Yes?
Yes, yes, yes, I can see that weve all reached the same decision. Now, I suggest we try and get the answer from the child, hmm? Vicki? Vicki, my dear, come in.
They have their planet back to themselves again. And somehow I dont think they will allow that rescue ship to land. Well.
No, Chesterton, no, it wasnt the reason. We shall be materialising quite soon. Perhaps we shall be able to get a rest this time.

I bring proof of courage and comradeship. What is this ship and why are you here? Identify yourselves by species and planet of origin.
Handles?
Handles? Argh. Handles?
Every ship I go on, they just shoot at me. Handles, I said, put me on a ship. I didn't say, put me on a Dalek ship.
Don't put me on a Dalek ship when I'm holding a broken bit of Dalek!
Ow!
Use your head.
It's not like you've got a lot of alternatives. They're all here. Daleks, Sontarans, Terileptils, Slitheen. And they're not even fighting, they're just parked. Why?
Yes, yes, the message, the message. Even I can't translate it. I mean, why is everyone here if they don't understand it?
Well, you know, I'm OCD. What's their excuse? What does this message mean?
Oh, no. And remind me I've got to patch the telephone back through the console unit. This is getting ridiculous.
Okay?
No, no. No, no, no, no. No, not now. Remind me later.
I don't know. Just later. Just pick a time.
I don't know. Just any old time. When you think I've forgotten.
Just pick a random number, express that number as a quantity of minutes, and when that time has elapsed, remind me to patch the telephone back through the console unit.
How those Cyber-evenings must fly.
Hello, the Tardis.
Ding dong. Okay, brilliant. I may be a bit rusty in some areas, but I will glance at a manual.
Oh, that was quick. It's a roller coaster this phone call.
Well, I hope you're nicer to the next one.
So?
Yeah, I did that once and there's no easy way to get rid of an android.
Yeah.
Handles, that's a new ship. Okay, we'll take the Tardis this time.
Sorry, missed that last bit. Got to dash.
Okay, don't be alarmed, I come in
Peace. No.
Argh! Sorry.
I'm being shot at by Cybermen!
Argh! Yeah, why not?
Clara!
Why? What is it? What's wrong?
Yes, I am naked. I wondered if you'd notice.
Because I'm going to church.
Better?
Hologram clothes, projected directly onto your visual cortex.
Everybody's naked underneath.
Hello, the Oswalds. Hello! Merry Christmas. Hello, hello.
Hello, handsome. Anyone for Twister?
Excuse me a moment. Listen, I've got an idea to break the ice. Why don't I project my clothes hologram onto their visual cortexes too?
Yes, and I'm starting to think it may be causing tension.
Eh? Sorry.
Oh, that's never going to work, is it?
I think a decent vet would give it an even chance.
An app?
Most certainly not. It doesn't do turkey. Nothing does turkey. You'd need a time machine. What?
You can't keep using the Tardis like this.
Missed birthdays, restaurant bookings. And please, just learn how to use iPlayer.
Yep, exposure to the time winds. It'll either come up a treat, or just possibly lay some eggs.
Oh, just a bit of a Cyberman. He'll get us to the church on time.
The organics are all gone, but there's still a full set of data banks. Found it at the Maldovar market.
Right, cool. Go on then. Okay, tell us, what is the planet? Go on.
Okay, in your own time, dear. Don't rush.
It's shielded. Even the Tardis can't break through it.
What did you say?
What are you talking about? Gallifrey? What do you mean?
You see that? Gallifrey is my home. I know it when I see it. That is not Gallifrey.
It's not Gallifrey. Gallifrey is gone.
Even if it survived, it's gone from this universe. That is not my home.
It can't be.
Papal Mainframe. It's like a great big flying church. The first ship to arrive. They are the ones who shielded the planet. They can get us down there.
Tasha Lem, the Mother Superious.
Oh, she's inviting us aboard.
Because I asked her. Swallow this.
Your hologram projector. You can't go to church with your clothes on.
I know. Relaxing, isn't it?
The Church of the Papal Mainframe, security hub of the known universe.
Yep. Keeping you safe in this world and the next. I venerate the exaltation of the Mother Superious.
Loving the frock.
Tash, this old thing? Please, I've been rocking it for centuries.
Clara, this is Tasha Lem, the Head of the Church of the Papal Mainframe. Tash, ho, ho, ho, ho. This is my, my associate, Clara Oswald. Miss Clara Oswald.
It was Tasha who shielded the planet. But you could sneak me down there, couldn't you, Tash?
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Clara. Well, quite a lot of it. Probably about half. Maybe a smidge under. Actually, Clara, would you mind waiting out here, please?
Yes, quite. No, stop it.
Well.
That altar looks like a bed.
Yep.
Feel?
What?
Right. What's the signal? Where's it coming from?
Right. Anyone been for a look?
Daleks, Cybermen, one of that lot, could break through your defences.
I do.
Are you okay?
When do I? Don't answer that.
What?
What can I do with a key? You, in, now.
The Tardis doesn't work by remote. Fine. If it makes you feel any better, there we are.
Okay, don't worry. There's a heat loss filter in your hologram shell. It'll kick in, just give it a moment. So, sweet little town covered in snow, half the universe in terror. Why? Why?
What?
What is it?
Okay, just stand back please, Clara.
Clara, step away from it!
Clara, keep looking at it. Don't look away. Don't even blink!
There is a Weeping Angel under the snow. It looks like a statue, isn't a statue. Can you get your foot out?
You're not wearing a shoe.
Okay, pull hard. One, two, three!
Keep looking at the. At all of them.
Quantum locked lifeform. It can only move if it's unobserved.
Same as everybody else. Must've got past Tasha's shield.
Keep looking!
I just need to bring the Tardis down.
No, but it can home in on the key.
She took one of them.
The old key in the quiff routine. Classic.
Okay, homing in on the mysterious message. Ooo yes, I like that. The mysterious message.
Yep. Clever plan to get us past the shield.
Yeah, tiny bit bored.
No, they're just delicate. Right, setting us down near the signal source. I'm going to turn the engines on silent. Don't want to make a fuss.
Why?
I know.
Now, what do we make of this place? It's two o'clock in the afternoon. Must be very short days here. The message is coming from that tower.
Hello! Hello, there. Right, we're a couple from the next town. My name's probably Hank or Rock, something like that.
Shut up. Hello, good to meet you. Nice snow.
I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. I stole a time machine and ran away and I've been flouting the principal law of my own people every since. That wasn't quite what I was meant to say!
Used to what?
I'm wearing a wig! No, ah, I see. Yes, of course. It's a truth field. Oh, that is so quaint. I haven't seen a truth field in years. I'm wearing a wig.
Doesn't that make life a bit difficult?
This town, what's it called?
It's July.
I don't know. How can an island be called Easter? Maybe it's just nice here. I almost hate to find out what's wrong.
There you are. What took you so long?
I knew. I always knew it wasn't over.
A split in the skin of reality.
A tiny sliver of the 26th of June, 2010. The day the universe blew up.
I rebooted it, put it all back together.
Well, it was my Tardis that blew it up in the first place. I felt a degree of responsibility. But the scar tissue remains. A structural weakness in the whole universe. Whoa! And someone's trying to get through it from outside our universe, from somewhere else. Of course. Of course. It makes sense.
Yes. If you were trying to break through a wall, you'd choose the weakest spot. If you were trying to break into this universe, you'd choose this crack, because. No. If you were trying to break back into this universe. (to Handles) You said Gallifrey. Why did you say Gallifrey?
No. I said it was in another universe. The message is coming through here. The truth field is too, at a guess. If it's the Time Lords. If it's the Time Lords.
Seal of the High Council of Gallifrey. Nicked it off the Master in the Death Zone. (Five Doctors) There is an algorithm imprinted in the atomic structure. Use it to decode the message.
It's a question. Why can't you just say it's a question?
The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.
A question only I could answer. A truth field to make sure I'm not lying. If I give my name, they'll know they've found the right place and that it's safe to come through.
Er, you need to take this to the Tardis and put it in the charger slot for the sonic.
Hell. All hell, that's what happens if the Time Lords come back. There's half a universe up there already, waiting to open fire. Now please, go to the Tardis and just do as I say.
Mother Superious, there is only one thing I need from you. This planet, what's it called?
If they return, they will come in peace.
They're asking for my help!
No, this planet is protected.
So, you lot, a quick word, thank you. Spot of news. Christmas has a new sheriff. Hello, everyone. I'm the Doctor.
There you go, Barnable.
Working fine. Nice action. Don't leave it out in the rain again.
Fixed the wheels and the antigrav.
Yeah, may have gone a bit far. Now then, what do we have today? Don't you move one step further. Wooden Cyberman. Nice. Like it.
Low tech, doesn't set off the alarms upstairs.
Only bit of tech allowed in. Got in before the truce. Now, I just sent an instruction to your firearm to reverse the polarity and fire out the back end. Now, as we're standing in a truth field, you will understand I cannot be lying. If you like, you can scan my screwdriver, verify that's the signal I sent.
Yes. I probably should have mentioned this doesn't work on wood. You send your friends up there a message from the Doctor. You tell them the Doctor stays.
Next.
And there's me arm-wrestling a Draconian. I remember that.
Christmas is defended.
You've got to be the drunk giraffe. You've got to commit! Don't be cool, guys. Cool is not cool.
And what's the dance we're doing?
The drunk giraffe. Yeah, it is. Merry Christmas. Give me a hug. Bring it in.
How's your father's barn?
Shush, they'll all want one.
Well. Where have you been for three hundred years? Ha!
It's my ship.
It's my Tardis. That's how I got here in the first place.
What are you doing here?
Well, you were in the time vortex. She must have extended the force field. No wonder. No wonder she's late, dragging you around.
I saved you.
I'm furious with you!
The turkey isn't done yet.
Oh, never stops. Come upstairs. It's almost time.
Dawn. The light here lasts only a few minutes. You don't want to miss it.
Well, it's a standoff. They can't attack in case I unleash the Time Lords, and I can't run away, because they'll burn this planet to stop the Time Lords. Hey, after all these years, I've finally found somewhere that needs me to stick around. A town called Christmas. Could've been worse. Right, there you go, buddy. Comfy?
How's that, is that better?
You just take it easy, buddy. He's getting old. I do my best for him, but I just can't get the parts, you know. Hey, I know the feeling.
I have a supplier. The pink ones are best.
Hey, don't you worry, Handles. you're just dreaming. The sun's coming up very soon. You just hang on in there.
Hey, Handles. Come on. Come on. One more dawn, you can do it. You've got it in you. Come on, just hang on in there.
Handles, what is it? What's wrong?
Come back. Handles? Handles. Oh. Thank you, Handles, and well done. Well done, mate.
What do you think of my new place? I come up here once a day for a few minutes, to remind myself of what it is I'm protecting.
Because if I hadn't, I'd have buried you a long time ago.
Ha! Everyone gets stuck somewhere eventually, Clara. Everything ends.
Have you been paying attention? I'm an old man now.
No, not for ever. I can change twelve times. Thirteen versions of me. Thirteen silly Doctors.
Ha. Are we forgetting Captain Grumpy, eh? I didn't call myself the Doctor during the Time War, but it was still a regeneration.
Well, number ten once regenerated and kept the same face. I had vanity issues at the time. Twelve regenerations, Clara. I can't ever do it again. This is where I end up. This face, this version of me. We saw this planet in the future, remember? All those graves, one of them mine.
I can't.
Ha! You think I'm just going to fly away, abandon everyone?
There is no one else to protect it.
Every life I save is a victory. Every single one.
Clara, I've been having that argument for the last three hundred years, all by myself.
Ah. Yes, well, that made it easier to stay. True.
Ah. Look who's woken up.
I'll be right up.
Nah, don't bother. I've got me motor back.
Yeah, well, the sun's gone down.
Everything ends, Clara. And sooner than you think.
Hmm. Are you guarding my Tardis, Barnable?
Oh, come on. You know me.
No, she's against ageing.
Confessional priests. Very popular. Genetically engineered so you forget everything you told them.
There you go.
Where are the pink ones?
It can't end, either.
Well, I did come to Trenzalore, and nothing can change that now. Didn't stop you trying though, did it?
So that's who blew up my Tardis. I thought I'd left the bath running.
The destiny trap. You can't change history if you're part of it.
Totally married her. I'd never have made it here alive without River Song.
They attacked here?
Why didn't you call me? I could have helped.
No.
No! No, no, no. Tasha, no, please, not Tasha. No. Fight it. Tash, fight it!
You shouldn't even know who I am.
Bet she never told you how to break through the Trenzalore forcefield, though. She'd have died first.
Well, you'd better kill me, then. Go on. But before you do
I'm a tough old bird. I'll be ages dying. Way enough time to answer a question. And, oh dear, what happens then, boys?
Fine, go on, kill her. Kill her! See if I care. But tell me, what you are going to do next?
You see, Tasha, that's what I'm talking about. That is a woman! I always knew you were a bit spineless, you and your pointless church. Why did I ever rely on you? Never trust a nun to do a Doctor's work.
And she's back!
You never could resist a row.
Well, you'd better ask nicely.
Right, get us back to the Tardis. Can you do that?
Fight it.
Listen to me. You have been fighting the psychopath inside you all your life. Shut up and win. That is an order, Tasha Lem.
Then this isn't a siege any more, it's a war. It's all up to you now. Fight the Daleks, inside and out. You can do it, I know you can.
Tasha, please. Please. Thank you.
It's done.
Your turkey. Either that or its woken up.
Go on, then.
Do you know, I've even got Christmas crackers.
Clara Oswald, I will never send you away again.
Yeah, smells great.
It's a reminder. Besides, I might leave tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the day after that.
Barnable?
Were you always so young?
Ah.
Merry Christmas.
Ah! Is there a joke? Ha?
Is it a knock knock one? Those are best.
Well, read it. Go on.
I don't get it.
Oh, all right, Barnable. Are you Barnable?
It's okay, Barnable, don't worry. I have got a plan. Off you pop.
I haven't got a plan, but people love it when I say that.
Oh, I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens, take the credit. That's generally how it works.
Not this time, though. This is it.
Yes. We saw the future, Clara. This is how it ends.
Ha.
I could have once, when there were Time Lords. Not any more.
No. You're going to stay here. Promise me you will.
I'll be keeping you safe. One last victory. Allow me that. Give me that, my impossible girl. Thank you. And goodbye.
The trouble with Daleks is, they take so long to say anything. Probably die of boredom before they shoot me.
Sorry I'm a bit slow. I may not be at my best right now.
Yes, I'm dying. You've been trying to kill me for centuries, and here I am, dying of old age. If you want something done, do it yourself.
You still can't work up the courage to shoot me, can you? You're still worried I've got something up my sleeve. Well, you knock yourselves out, boys. I've got nothing this time.
Sorry, what did you say? Did you mention the rules? Now, listen. Bit of advice. Tell me the truth if you think you know it. Lay down the law if you're feeling brave. But, Daleks, never, ever tell me the rules!
Oh, look at this. Regeneration number thirteen. We're breaking some serious science here, boys. I tell you what, it's going to be a whopper!
You think you can stop me now, Daleks? If you want my life, ha, ha, come and get it!
Love from Gallifrey, boys!
Hello.
Ha! It's started. I can't stop it now. This is just the reset. A whole new regeneration cycle. Ooo.
Taking a bit longer. Just breaking it in. Oh. Oh. Gah.
It all just disappears, doesn't it? Everything you are, gone in a moment, like breath on a mirror. Any moment now, he's a-coming.
The Doctor.
Yep, and I always will be.
But times change, and so must I.
Amelia?
The first face this face saw. We all change, when you think about it. We're all different people all through our lives. And that's okay, that's good, you've got to keep moving, so long as you remember all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this. Not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me.
Hey
Kidneys! I've got new kidneys. I don't like the colour.
We're probably crashing. Oh!
Stay calm. Just one question. Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?

Ah, smell that Atlantic breeze. Nice and cold. Lovely. Martha, have you met my friend?
Gateway to the New World. Give me you tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath free.
Well, there's the genuine article. So good, they named it twice. Mind you, it was New Amsterdam originally. Harder to say twice. Now wonder it didn't catch on. New Amsterdam, New Amsterdam.
Work in progress. Still got a couple floors to go, and if I know my history, that makes the date somewhere around
You're getting good at this.
I think our detour just got longer.
Herbert Hoover, thirty first President of the USA, came to power a year ago. Up till then New York was a boom town, the Roaring Twenties, and then.
Yeah. Whole economy wiped out overnight. Thousands of people unemployed. All of a sudden, the huddled masses doubled in number with nowhere to go. So, they ended up here in Central Park.
Ordinary people lost their jobs. Couldn't pay the rent and they lost everything. There are places like this all over America. No one's helping them. You only come to Hooverville when there's nowhere else to go.
Come on. (to Solomon) I suppose that makes you the boss around here.
So, men are going missing. Is this true?
But what does missing mean? Men must come and go here all the time. It's not like anyone's keeping a register.
And you're sure someone's taking them?
So the question is, who's taking them and what for?
What do you mean? What sort of accidents?
Oh, no, no, no. I'm volunteering. I'll go.
And if we don't come back up?
So this Diagoras bloke, who is he then?
How'd he manage that then?
Whoa!
Shine your torch through it. Composite organic matter. Martha? Medical opinion?
No, it's not. And I'll tell you something else. We must be at least half a mile in. I don't see any sign of a collapse, do you? So why did Mister Diagoras send up down here?
Well, we're right underneath Manhattan.
Looks like it.
Solomon, I think it's time you took these two back. I'll be much quicker on my own.
Do you think they're still alive?
This way.
It's all right, Frank. Just stay back. Let me have a look. He's got a point, though, my mate Frank. I'd hate to be stuck down here on my own. We know the way out. Daylight. If you come with us
Oh, but what are you?
No, it's real. I'm sorry. Now listen to me. I promise I can help. Who did this to you?
Actually, good point.
Yeah, I noticed that, thanks. Well then, Martha, Frank, Solomon.
Eh? Er, basically, run!
This way!
It's a ladder! Come on!
I've got you. C'mon! Come on!
No!
We've got to go back down. We can't just leave him.
Yeah. It might, might just help if you put that down.
Listen, ahwhat's your name?
Tallulah.
Right. We can try to find Laszlo, but he's not the only one. There are people disappearing every night.
Look, listen, just trust me. Everyone is in danger. I need to find out exactly what this is.
Because then I'll know exactly what we're fighting.
Perfect. It's the capacitors I need. I'm just rigging up a crude little DNA scan for this beastie. If I can get a chromosomal reading, I can find out where it's from.
Oh, I'm just sort of passing by.
No. Sorry.
Good luck.
That's it. We need to heat you up.
This is artificial.
Genetically engineered. Whoever this is, oh, you're clever.
Fundamental DNA type four six seven dash nine eight nine. Nine eight nine. Hold on, that means planet of origin. Skaro.
Where is she? Where's Martha?
Martha!
They've taken her.
No, no, no, no, no way. You're not coming.
There's nothing you can do. Go back.
Tallulah, you're not safe down here.
This way.
Shush.
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They survived. They always survive while I lose everything.
It's called a Dalek. And it's not just metal, it's alive.
Does it look like I'm kidding? Inside that shell is a creature born to hate, whose only thought is to destroy everything and everyone that isn't a Dalek too. It won't stop until it's killed every human being alive.
Every second you're down here, you're in danger. I'm taking you back right now.
Where's Martha? What have you done with her? What have you done with Martha?
Can you remember your name?
What happened to you?
Who did?
The Daleks. Why?
Do you know what happened to Martha?
Laszlo, can you show me where they are?
If I don't stop them, they'll kill everyone.
Shush.
And the others?
Why? What for?
Look out, they're moving!
I'm not coming. I've got an idea. You go.
Just keep walking.
Yeah, well, you can kiss me later. You too, Frank, if you want.
Evolution?
Ask them.
I don't exactly want to get noticed. Ask them what's going on.

You could leave all that stuff here, you know. We do have literally acres of room.
Sorry. Stopped listening a while ago. Okay. Er, same time you left, same place-ish.
These readings are very er, ishy.
Uh huh?
Well. Well, I wonder what caused this? I don't think we're bigger, are we?
And a hundred and twenty miles from where we should be. Impressive.
No. This is impressive.
This is annoying. The Tardis never does this. This is huge! Well, not literally huge. Slightly smaller than usual. Which is huge.
Your house isn't going anywhere. And neither is mine until I get this figured out. Could you not just let me enjoy this moment of not knowing something? I mean, it happens so rarely. Look, I don't think this is dangerous, but I wouldn't like you to get squished accidentally. Anyway, I need you to help me find out what's caused this.
Now, that wasn't me, was it?
Oh, that can't be good.
Could be.
[OC]: Exactly where I was.
Yes. Oh.
Yes, I am.
And, no, it's not adorable. It's very, very serious.
No. I'm exactly the same size. It's merely the exterior dimensions that have changed.
Stop laughing. This is serious.
Well, plainly I can't. Something nearby is leeching all the external dimensions.
Possibly. Oh, who am I kidding? Probably. Sensors are down and I can't risk taking off with it in this state. Clara, I need you to pick up the Tardis. Carefully. It should be possible. I've adjusted the relative gravity.
Clara, it's always lighter. If the Tardis were to land with its true weight, it would fracture the surface of the Earth.
I've managed to get a rough fix on the source of the dimensional leeching.
It's roughly north west. That way.
Now, listen! You're going to need these.
No, it does not, so don't get any ideas.
And listen, stick this in your ear.
Can you hear me?
Nanotech.
I just hacked your optic nerve.
I see what you see.
Yes, I'm dizzy. But nothing useful.
No time to fraternize. Come on, get rid of him.
Don't you dare.
Of lies.
Why, Doctor Oswald, you are hilarious.
[OC]: Could we get back to work, do you think?
Oh, he's a bright one, hang on to him.
Ooh, now you're talking. I love a good locked room mystery.
Hello, barely sentient local.
How do you sleep at night?
Missing people, tiny Tardis, what's the link?
Clara, look, I think that we can manage on our own from now on.
He's a pudding brain.
Worse than that, he's a fluorescent pudding brain.
Do you know, I think that you were wrong about this lad. I think that he could be very useful. Vital local knowledge.
Yes. So try not to scare him off.
Clara, this is the
Scaring off that we were talking about.
Clara, local knowledge is leaving. Do something!
I didn't mean that!
You really do throw your companions in at the deep end, don't you?
Yes, it's a lovely thought. Which is why I set the sonic to scan for that as soon as we entered. Pleased to meet you.
Well, of course he might have been squashed under a policeman's shoe by now.
Do you know, I don't think that statement's ever been truer.
Yes. Whatever it was, it just drained a massive amount of energy
From inside the Tardis.
I don't know, but that's the least of my problems. Just get us out of there.
I mean this is just embarrassing. I'm from the race that built the Tardis. Dimensions are kind of our thing. So why can't I understand this?
Clara, I need more info. Where else have people disappeared?
Clara, I think that your shrink
Ray theory was wrong.
It just struck me. Locked room mysteries. Classic solution number one, they're still in the room. Classic solution number two, they're in the walls.
I can hear you, you know.
What am I missing? The Tardis should be able to detect anything in the known universe. The known universe. This universe.
Clara, wait, go back.
Back, back, back. That mural.
That is a nervous system
Scaled up and flattened. I think we've found PC Forrest. What's left of her, at least.
The mural in the flat. That wasn't a desert at all. It's a microscopic blow up of human skin.
Whatever they are, they are experimenting. They're testing. They are, they are dissecting. Trying to understand us.
Trying to understand three dimensions.
Fascinating. Clara, they're in the walls!
Keep away from them. If they touch you, you're finished.
Clara, the window!
Nice. Not technically lying.
This explains everything. They're from a universe with only two dimensions. And, yes, that is a thing. It's long been theorised, of course, but no one could go there and prove its existence without a heck of a diet.
And what long story are you going to tell Danny, huh? Or haven't you made it up yet?
Excellent lying, Doctor Oswald.
I meant to me. You told me that Danny was okay with you being back on board the Tardis.
Yeah, because he doesn't know anything about it.
Congratulations. Lying is a vital survival skill.
And a terrible habit.
Yeah, of course I am.
What? Oh, right, blowing out that window's possibly affected the earpiece. Take it out and sonic it.
Look, Clara. Talk to me, talk to me!
Clara, the mural. Clara, it's the mural! Over there, look, the mural! We've found the missing people, they're in the walls!
Act normal, but get everyone out.
What? It takes quite a lack of imagination to beat psychic paper.
Clara, stop him.
They're wearing the dead like camouflage.
Clara, get them out of there!
I agree.
We'll have to think of a better name for them than that.
Clara, this is a
Vital stage. This little group is currently confused and disorientated
But pretty soon a leader is going to emerge. You need to make sure that leader is you.
Well done.
Ah, welcome to my world. So what's next, Doctor Clara?
What?
In a manner of speaking. It's true that people with hope tend to run faster, whereas people who think they're doomed
So that's what I sound like.
Right, here's something that might help you. Do you remember the graffiti from the estate? Footprints, tyre treads?
Well, I don't think it was graffiti. I think that that is
How those creatures saw us.
The impressions we make in two dimensional space. That was them reaching out, attempting to talk.
At which point they moved into flattening and dissection. Trying to understand. Trying to emulate. But here's the big question. Do they know they're hurting us?
That's a very good question. Why don't we ask them?'
We need to find a way to communicate.
Because their idea of language is just as bizarre as their idea of space. Even the Tardis is confused.
I know a race
Made of sentient gas who throw fireballs as a friendly wave. I know another race with sixty four stomachs who talk to each other by
Disembowelling.
My point being that in a universe as immense and bizarre as this one, you cannot be too quick to judge.
Perhaps these creatures don't even understand that we need three dimensions to live in.
They may not even know that they're hurting us.
No. I really hope that.
It would make a nice change, wouldn't it? Okay. Let's start with pi. Even in a flat world they would have circles. I don't mean edible pie, I mean circular pi. Which I realise would also mean edible pie but anyway.
They're responding. The Tardis is translating now.
It's a number. Fifty five.
Tenth Fibonacci number. Atomic number of caesium.
We don't know that.
Two two. Twenty two.
Clara, be careful.
I know. I did see.
Give me a minute. I'm working on it.
You can't apply human logic. You're dealing with creatures from another dimension.
Clara, I might be able to help with that door.
Give me five minutes.
I think I've figured out a way to restore three dimensions. At least on a small scale, say
Door handles.
We're not calling it a de-flattener.
This should be able to restore dimensions. You see what I've called it?
No. Twodis. It's called the Twodis. (sigh) Why'd I even bother? Well, give it a go, then.
Clara, I don't know how, but they're doing it again. They're leeching the Tardis!
They've changed frequency. This time it's different.
Of course. The next stage. 3D.
I've boosted the output.
Absolutely.
Clara, stop. Use it again. It can reverse the process.
They have a new ability. Of course they have. Now they're 3D, they can restore dimensions.
Clara, do you want the good news or the bad news?
The good news is I've come up with a theoretical way to send them back to their own dimension.
And that's the bad news. The Tardis doesn't have enough dimensional energy to pull it off.
Apparently these things can pump it out as fast as they can steal it.
I don't know. My shields have gone. Structural integrity is failing. Another blow like that and I've had it.
Er, I'm on the train lines. And there's a train coming. Of course there is. Short-term re-materialisation? Not enough power. Teleport? Not enough power. Re-route the heart of the Tardis through - not enough power! Not enough power!
Clara, there is no power. The Tardis couldn't boil an egg at the moment. Listen, do what you can to get those people out of there.
You're stronger than you know.
Ha! Di di di.
I don't know if you can still hear me out there, but the Tardis is now in siege mode. No way in, no way out. I managed to turn it on just before the train hit. But there's not enough power left now to turn it off.
No, no, no. What are you doing?
Life support failing. I don't know if you'll ever hear this, Clara. I don't even know if you're still alive out there.
But you were good! And you made a mighty fine Doctor.
I tried to talk. I want you to remember that. I tried to reach out, I tried to understand you, but I think that you understand us perfectly.
And I think you just don't care. And I don't know whether you are here to invade, infiltrate or just replace us.
I don't suppose it really matters now. You are monsters. That is the role you seem determined to play. So it seems I must play mine.
The man that stops the monsters. I'm sending you back to your own dimension. Who knows? Some of you may even survive the trip. And, if you do, remember this. You are not welcome here. This plane is protected. I am the Doctor.
And I name you The Boneless.
Apparently. Are you okay?
And a lot of people died.
It wasn't a fire, those weren't trees, those were people.
I bet you wouldn't.
Yes, a lot of people died and maybe the wrong people survived.
We did. You did.
Balance?
Largely so other people don't have to.
You heard that, did you?
Yes.
Ah! The return of the fluorescent pudding brain.
I know. Your last painting was so good it saved the world. I can't wait to see what you do next.
Is that PE?
Talk to soldier boy.
You were an exceptional Doctor, Clara.
Goodness had nothing to do with it.

Oh, on target, it seems. You changed your mind about going home.
Of course.
I believe you. I'm just a little doubtful about how resolute you'll remain.
Yes, indeed. Aboard the Tardis it always does.
Earth.
I promised to show Tegan a little of her planet's future. We're almost there. You could let her know.
It's my own fault. I should, er, I should have changed it for a Type 57 while I had the chance.
Oh, yes. Very close to Earth, in orbit above the atmosphere belt.
Er, slight hiccup in our time zones. We're too far advanced. I'm sorry.
It's a robot weapons system. It seems to be scanning us.
Reset the coil cut-out.
Sentinel Six, could you repeat your instructions, please.
Sentinel Six, we have no hostile intentions. Our presence here is purely temporary. All we need is a bit of time to alter coordinates.
Well, it's obviously thinking it over.
Don't panic, Tegan. Now look, just push this. Almost there.
Sentinel Six, we are unarmed.
Sentinel Six, we need just a little more time then we will be on our way.
We're out of control.
Not if I can perform a materialisation flip flop.
Stage one.
Yes, well, I admit it was close.
Still in the same time zone.
I think so. Let's find out.
Or submarine. There's no motion. It could be on the seabed. Come on.
Yes, of course. A Sea Base.
Oh, thank you.
Ah ha. That, Turlough, was the all clear.
No, no, it's a Sea Base. A rather special kind of undersea military colony. Help me get this open, would you? Armed with the sort of missiles that kill life but leave everything else intact.
Very probably.
Around 2084.
Absolutely nothing, Tegan. There are still two power blocs, fingers poised to annihilate each other. Hexachromite.
Hexachromite gas. It's part of a sealing compound for undersea structures. It's lethal to marine and reptile life. I thought they would have banned it by now.
No.
Er, yes, yes, the bridge. Repairs to the Tardis will take some time. Better they're done with the Captain's permission.
Well, if I remember rightly, the command centre's at the top of the structure.
No, wait!
This.
Yes, it has to be done in sequence. It's what's called security. We must find someone in authority and quickly. Come on.
Security screen.
Well, they've sealed off the area. Back to the Tardis. We'll be safer there.
This way.
They're between us and the Tardis. Come on, back this way.
You didn't read what it said outside?
Try and start a diversion.
That's it.
I've hotted things up a bit. I've set the reactor on overload.
Oh, I shouldn't think so. They've got a couple of hours to sort out what I've done.
And in the confusion, we can slip back to the Tardis.
When I say run, run. Run!
I'm so sorry.
You'll live.
What have you been eating?
Yeah, so did I for a moment. Where's Turlough?
Yes, all right. First I must get you back to the Tardis.
Yes, all right.
Come along, Tegan.
Good. Now, you must stay outside, Tegan.
Shush.
My peace of mind. Please, Tegan, don't argue. Now, I don't need to tell you what to do should anything go wrong.
Yes, thank you.
I wouldn't, if I were you. Well, gentlemen, it seems we have a problem.
So it seems. Perhaps it's time for a little mutual trust.
Turlough was telling the truth.
Well, Commander?
Thank you.
When I've repaired her.
No, don't!
Yes. You mustn't attack.
Do so and you'll regret it. I know what that ship is.
I'm telling you you have no defence. That's a Silurian battle cruiser.
The race that ruled this planet long before your species evolved.
Trust me. You must try and make contact with it, find out what they want.
I did try and warn you.
It's a particle suppressor. They turned your energy beam back on you. They could have blown this base apart. They certainly have enough reason to.
A long time ago. I let them down then, it seems I'll do so again.
They're honourable. All they ever wanted to do was live in peace.
Commander.
You can't fight them.
Inform your people. Let them know what's going on down here.
Friend or enemy, it's a distinction that's lost on the Silurians, I assure you. To them you're all the same. Ape-descended primitives. An evolutionary error they obviously mean to correct.
Let me go with them. I know the Silurians. If I can talk to them, we may be able to avoid bloodshed.
Look on the bright side, Tegan.
Oh dear.
The Myrka.
I'm afraid the Myrka takes quite a lot to impress.
Tegan!
Are you all right?
Anything damaged?
Turlough, help me!
Keep back. Don't let it touch you.
Bulic, get your people out of here!
You too, Turlough.
Get out!
I'm not leaving you.
Who's talking about dying?
One last try.
Thank you so much.
Brave heart, Tegan.
Get ready. Mind your eyes, Tegan.
Simple. The charge from the Myrka's body blew up the magazine.
Yes, temporarily.
Well, hopefully we can stop it before it does too much damage.
Yes, we all have an Achilles' heel, Tegan, including the Myrka. Now we must hurry. I must speak to Vorshak.
He's right, Commander. Your weapons are useless against it.
The bulkhead wouldn't have kept the Myrka out for long.
If it's any consolation, I may just know how to stop it.
You've got nothing to lose.
After I've dealt with the Myrka.
I need just one person. Someone in authority who can get things done.
It can only be heading for one place.
Yes, the bridge.
Do you have ultraviolet converters on the Base?
Good. Now, will the Myrka have to pass this way to get to the bridge?
Perfect. I need a converter brought here.
Ah. Set it up here.
Now, what do you think. Will the lighting circuit bear maximum converter load?
I'm planning to bring a little sunshine into the Myrka's life.
The Myrka is a creature of the inkiest depths, or it was until the Silurians tinkered with its biology. Anyway, it has little tolerance to light and hopefully none at all to ultraviolet rays.
No, Tegan. Perhaps you should ask it nicely to go away.
Yes, almost.
Look!
Perfect. Almost.
Yes, I think so.
Very wise.
Something wrong?
Here it comes. Now we'll know if my theory was right.
Just a few more feet.
All right, Tegan, close your eyes. Make a wish!
Very. Let's get back to the bridge.
Obvious. Control the Base and the proton missiles
Or destroy it.
The Myrka is dead, Commander.
There isn't time for your petty feuds.
Do you? Before long, the Silurians and the Sea Devils will have control of this Base.
The technology of these creatures predates yours by millions of years. If they intend to fire those missiles, they have the means, I assure you.
I'm going after Nilson.
Let Tegan go. She's of no use to you now. Killing us won't make your escape any easier. You fire, and every Sea Devil in the area will come running.
Tegan, make a wish!
Goodbye.
How do you do? I'm the Doctor. Haven't we met before?
Ichtar.
Yes. I thought he'd been killed.
You do not recognise me now, but we are known to each other.
No, wait, wait, please. In an earlier regeneration you knew me as the Doctor.
I know that you are Ichtar, the surviving leader of the noble Silurian Triad. When we last met I tried to mediate between you and the people of Earth.
May we speak?
So it seems. Why? A civilised race like yours, waging unprovoked war?
Defensive? There's no such thing. When we last met, your supreme wish was to live at peace with the other inhabitants of this planet. Now, why change such an enlightened policy now?
What, by actions such as we've seen here?
There can be no alternative to peaceful co-existence.
Genocide? When everything you Silurians hold sacred forbids it?
You'll trigger the war this Base was designed to fight.
I would do as he says if I were you, Commander.
Alive or dead, they can still use your hand scan, and while there's life there's also hope.
Not so.
If my guess is right, that little piece of Silurian gadgetry will more than make up for the lack of a sync operator unless we're able to do something about it.
Do you intend to explode those missiles in space?
Launching those things will trigger a holocaust. You'll destroy everyone.
To be masters of a dead planet.
I see.
What about us? Are we included in your final solution?
And the rest of these people?
Commander.
Excellent timing. Is Turlough safe?
Lead on.
Impossible. They need him in there.
Not here, not now. We'll come back for him, I promise.
The chemical store.
Shush.
Turlough.
The chemical store.
Watch the doors.
An alternative to this. Something less lethal that will do the job just as well.
Oh yes, all in all they were very forthcoming, really. They intend to launch your missiles and trigger a war to end all wars, between your people, of course.
Hexachromite. It does that to all reptile life.
And kill them?
I sometimes wonder why I like the people of this miserable planet so much. The Silurians and Sea Devils are noble races. They have skills and talents you pathetic humans can only dream about.
No. No, and we must stop them.
Something that will disable rather than kill.
Yes, I hear. What does it mean?
Yes, all right. Turlough, get the grill open. Preston, fetch that pump. We have to feed the gas into the ventilation system.
It'll take some time for the gas to spread throughout the Base.
I hope it won't be necessary at all. If I can get to the bridge in time, I may be able to reason with Ichtar, persuade him to abandon the missile run.
Yes, well, this time I'll have something to back my argument.
Now, I want you all to go back to the Tardis. You'll be safer there whatever happens.
I must go.
You must listen to me.
A waste.
No. No, I must get to the bridge.
Yes, all right. Bring oxygen. We may need it.
It's working, and quickly. I can't bargain with Ichtar if his guards are dead.
No, wait. Your warriors are dying everywhere. Abandon the base.
Abandon the launch! There's still time to save your own lives.
Who will replace you? With you dies the last of the Triad, the custodians of your race. What will become of your people then?
Bulic, turn off the gas!
The missiles are set to fire. How long have we got?
What's the abort procedure?
Well, it must be done at once.
Well, I shall have to try.
Oh, you have a better idea?
No, no, there isn't time.
Tegan, look after the Silurians. Give them oxygen.
Did I succeed?
There should have been another way.

Shush. Something terribly exciting's about to happen.
Mister McGregor.
Mister McGregor. He's chasing Peter Rabbit. He's got a sieve. He's going to pop it on top of Peter!
Atchoo.
Junk? Did you say junk? I don't carry junk.
That's extremely valuable equipment.
Give that to me. Come on, give it to me.
Yes. If I hadn't produced that ball of string to find a way out of the labyrinth, they were going to unravel my scarf, the wretches.
Don't be a philistine.
That jawbone's been about a bit, you know.
Well, that's just a bit of old junk.
Because is doesn't work.
Yes, but it's an awful nuisance.
Yes, yes. Such a bore.
What, to bore?
I was never in distress.
Well, not often. I mean, not what you'd call often. Go on, plug it in.
Switch it off! Switch it off!
That's better. I told you that thing never worked properly.
Well, there's a fault in it then, isn't there. That was no distress call. Was it? Was it?
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.
But shush. We've landed. I wonder where we are? Anyone know?
No idea. Let's find out, shall we? Not you, K9. You stay here. By the way, how did you know about Peter Rabbit?
That's odd.
It's very odd.
This is.
It's an egg.
Yes. Well, part of a shell, anyway. Can't see the rest of it.
Yeah.
If it was a bird.
Semi-metallic.
It's alive.
The shell.
Listen. Can't you hear?
It's the same noise we heard in the Tardis. There must be a transmitter here.
Well, somewhere, somewhere. It stands to reason.
Yes. Stands to reason. Stupid expression, stands to reason.
Why doesn't it lie down to reason? Much easier to reason lying down. Relaxes the cerebellum.)
Yes! It's definitely the shell that's the transmitter. I wonder what it's transmitting, and to whom? Well, I suppose to whatever laid it. Hmm, that's not a very pleasant thought, is it, Doctor.
Curious material. Almost looks as if it. Almost looks as if it were woven.
Ow! That's sharp. Romana. Romana! Romana, would you come here a moment, please? Oh, hello.
Have you seen my assistant? Romana! Romana! Obviously not. All right, I won't bother you then.
Can you get these things off me?
Did you get those things off me?
Thank you very much.
What? And just as we're all getting on so well?
Look, I don't want to stand on protocol or anything like that, but couldn't you at least do the done thing and take me to your leader?
Wait! Are you in charge here?
Thank you very much. You saved my life and I am a doctor. What are those things?
Weeds? What, plant weeds?
Good lord. If I were you, I'd introduce her to geraniums before it's too late.
Oh, just pottering around. I have this insatiable curiosity, you see. Why do you call it the Place of Death?
Ah. Is that so? You know, I've always been fascinated by place names and I trust you'll make an exception in my case.
My commander?
Oh, that commander. Hello, commander.
It's tricky to explain.
Oh, it travels. We travel in it. Look, I'll show you. You'll like it. Come along, Romana.
There was no need to go to all this trouble. All she had to do was make an appointment.
What do you think is going on?
You realise, of course, we're being followed.
Hmm? Nice place you've got here, old chap. Very green.
Yes. Sorry.
Romana? Romana? Where's Romana?
Who were they?
Well, what about Romana?
Do you mind? I've got a terrible itch. Itchy nose. No, no, no, no, no. My nose, not your nose. Come on, come over here. Come on. Put your finger up like that. Now, you scratch my nose. Ooo, other side. That is so good. Atchoo!
Sorry about that, fellows.
Ah.
You know how it is when you get an itch.
No, no, no, thank you. There's no itch any more.
Yes, it was a bit incommodious.
I suppose you could say the yoke's on him, if you were the sort of person who said that sort of thing, which fortunately I'm not. You must be the Lady Adrasta.
Yes! Do you know, I'll tell you something fascinating about that.
Oh, you knew. Well, don't you think you could at least put up a notice?
Do you mean the egg?
Yes.
Well
No, but I'm full of theories about it.
Lady Adrasta, I'd like to talk to you about these things, but at the moment I'm much more concerned about Romana.
No, no, she's not my commander. She's my companion.
You couldn't see a man of my obvious talents in a sub. Oh, no, of course. You're very kind.
Hmm, I wonder what they'll do to her?
No, the bandits.
And if she's not?
Yes. What is this thing?
Extraordinary texture. How long has it been there?
The shell?
Alive and screaming in pain.
Because it can only be detected on very low frequency wavelengths.
Ah. More to the point, for whom is it screaming? Its mummy? By the pyramids, imagine the size of its mummy.
Who are these, the undertakers?
Ah, how do you do?
Why, what would you call it?
A temple. Ha!
Convinced? Pooh.
Well, of course it is, of a sort.
Yes?
No, but it isn't only birds that lay eggs, is it? Fishes do.
Oh, very big ones. Or a big reptile.
Perhaps a gigantic frog.
Er, someone tried to fry the egg?
He's quite right.
Well, to be fair, I did have a couple of gadgets which he probably didn't, like a teaspoon and an open mind.
Where are they taking him?
Yes, perhaps I will, and interesting too, I hope.
Oh, how nice to meet a well-mannered guard.
What's this?
Ah. You have such a way with words.
Look, I don't know what you intend to do with Engineer Doran.
Well, I suggest you think again. After all, he may be a bit of an idiot, but at least he's a conscientious idiot, and even bad engineers are hard to come by on this side of the galaxy.
What's that?
Romana, no!
Everest In Easy Stages.
It's in Tibetan!
Pi-e pa-ha. Do not be afraid.
Dead, poor chap. Doran? Doran? Doran. Doran.
Doran.
Yuk.
Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for saving me from that creature.
Indeed you did, and I am grateful, and your mother was obviously a very fine woman. I'm the Doctor. Who are you?
Organon?
What are you doing down here?
Ah. Well, I guess it could happen to anybody.
What?
Oh, well.
No, I tend to use a police box affair.
Yes. What about your prophecy? Did it by any chance concern the Lady Adrasta?
Yes.
Ooo, a bit rash, wasn't it?
Yes, I can see it might. But the Lady Adrasta?
Vagueness.
Ah.
Me? Oh, from beyond the stars, you know.
Yes.
Me? No, no, no, no, no. I jumped.
Yes. Do you think she's frightened of someone coming from beyond the stars?
No, no, no. I don't think it was me she was expecting. How long have you been down here?
Well, at least the creature hasn't attacked you yet.
Yeah, and lucky to have lamps, too.
Inconvenient commodity to be short of.
Really? Why do you say that?
The only mine?
Ah. A monopoly of metal.
So a continued shortage suits her.
What? Do you know something? I think that's terribly interesting.
How big is it?
Huge? How huge? Hundred feet?
Huge. And that noise it makes.
Singing, crying, growling.
Are you sure of that?
Why? You've been everywhere, have you?
Very pretty, though. Very pretty.
Yes.
No.
It's gone.
No.
No.
No.
Did you examine that thing's skin?
It looked almost like a cerebral membrane.
The membrane that protects the brain.
Yes.
Let's find out, shall we?
Yes. Why not?
I thought you weren't going to come.
Shush. Somewhere up ahead.
What is it?
I don't know. I'll tell you something I'd rather know.
What's that creature doing here? Pure brain a hundred foot across stuck at the bottom of a pit, oozing about and sitting on people. Not much of a life, is it.
Hmm. Perhaps it was born among them.
Shush. Come on.
Shush. I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
A plan? Oh yes, I've got a plan.
I just don't know how to apply it, that's all.
Hello there.
Steady, steady. You're standing on my scarf.
Pure cadmium. That didn't come from this mine.
A nugget of iron. Iron ore I could understand, but pure iron? I wonder where it came from?
Hello. Friend. Friend. It's all right, it's all right. Look, you can see I'm not armed, eh? I won't hurt you. How could I hurt you? I mean, how? You've got beautiful skin. Extraordinary skin. Green veins. Chlorophyll? I wonder. Well, if it's chlorophyll you need, you've come to the right place. Chlorophyll? I wonder. No, don't get frightened. It's all right, it's all right. Shush. Shush.
There. There, that's not so bad now, is it. Good girl. Good boy. You're a problem, you know. You're aware of me, yet you haven't got any eyes. Haven't got a mouth. At least, not one that I can see. Come to think of it, you haven't even got a head. So how do we communicate, hmm? Telepathy?
Hello? I am the Doctor. Friend. Friend.
Hello. I am the Doctor. Friend. Friend. Nothing. Not a thing. How are we going to talk to each other, eh? Why can't we talk to each other? How do you communicate with your own kind?
Steady. Steady, friend. You don't know your own. Easy. Friend. Friend.
What's that? A picture? I've seen that somewhere before.
So that's what you want. Easy, easy, shush. You do want it, don't you? What's it for? Is it a weapon? What is it? Come on. At least say something. Communicate. Give me a sign. I wish I knew how far I could trust you. Still, you haven't harmed me yet. Much. All right, I'll get it for you, but I want you to promise. That's a stupid thing to say. You can't even speak. How can you promise me anything? All right, be good. Stay here. Ah.
Bits of shell. Bits of eggshell. No, no, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right. All right, all right. Look, I'm not going to take them. I'm not going to take them. There you are. I can take a hint. I can take a hint, yeah. If we ever do find your mouth, wherever it is, you've got a lot of explaining to do, my friend. All right, all right, I said I can take a hint. I'm off, I'm off, I'm off. Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.
Hello, everybody.
Yes, I'm fine.
Oh, you shouldn't be worried. Time Lords have ninety lives.
About a hundred and thirty.
What?
Ah. I asked the Creature very nicely. My pleasure, it said.
It is, rather, isn't it.
I was.
Crossed computers.
Computers. It's the symbol of the maternity service on Gallifrey.
I don't know. Why don't you ask it? Incidentally, how did you know with such certainty that creature couldn't talk, eh? What do you know about it? And why do you want it killed so badly, hmm?
No, no, please.
No, I'm afraid for them. Have you any idea what that creature can do?
All right, K9.
Call them back.
You could be sending them to their deaths, you know.
Why?
Thank you.
What a pity you didn't bring your charts. You could have worked it out for yourself.
What is it?
Shush. Lady Adrasta, they've been gone a long time.
Oh, a few hundred yards along the passageway there's a big cave. It was in there.
Hmm. Look, why don't I go?
Maybe it isn't your lucky day.
Have you ever thought of taking up another line of work? I don't think astrology is your forte.
You realise what this means, Adrasta? It means a great green blob several hundred feet long is loose somewhere in these passageways. An angry green blob. A green blob you tried to kill.
No, no, no. Adrasta, you're insane. You have some idea of what that creature can do. Can you imagine? At the moment it's reasonably friendly, but if K9 shoots it.
It'll get very angry.
What, a creature that size? He's only a little dog, you know.
The what?
I thought you said Tythonian.
You've bitten off more than you can chew, haven't you.
No, no, she won't. She won't. She'll refuse, you know. Won't you, Romana?
Did you hear that, Romana? Karela's going to kill you, and you with your hair all messed up.
Oh, so you are. I didn't notice. Here, let me help you.
K9? Ready, fire!
No, Romana, no!
Frightening, isn't it?
What? An evil thing, killing. Why should it want to kill you? It didn't want to kill me, did you, old fellow? Do you know something? I believe he wants to kill you.
Oh, come on. You know it really doesn't eat people, don't you? But you know what it does eat and you haven't been letting it get any, have you. No, you just stuck it in a pit and threw people at it.
Yes, I wouldn't be surprised if it wanted to kill you. I wouldn't be surprised at all.
Don't do it, Romana.
Keep her safe, Romana.
Hello.
What did you say?
I'm not sure.
I don't know.
I don't know. That wasn't me talking.
Look, I know this sounds odd. I didn't say that.
What I just said.
Did you hear what I said just now?
Yes. I didn't say that.
No. I was too busy being frightened and alarmed.
Let's find out, shall we?
Oh, please! You put that very crudely.
Of course! I should have guessed instantly. It's all the fault of that woman Adrasta.
I was just saying, lady Adrasta, that. K9, I thought you were meant to be guarding her.
Yes.
No.
Organon? Goodbye, old man. So sorry about this. Thanks for all the help.
If my deductions are correct, the well-being of two planets is at stake. Erato must not die.
No, wait. That's all you've got on this planet, isn't it? Weeds, weeds, forest and weeds. You scratch about for food wherever you can, but you can't plough the land, can you? You can't do anything until you've mastered the forests and the weeds. And you can't do that without metal.
Do that, and you will hurl this planet back into the dark ages. And for what? To satisfy the petty power cravings of that pathetic woman.
Have a care yourself. Care for your people for a change.
Now, if my deductions are correct.
Erato came here fifteen years ago to propose a trading agreement. Tythonus is a planet rich in metallic ores and minerals. Am I not right, K9?
That was a good guess.
The Tythonions exist on ingesting chlorophyll. Large quantities of it, judging by their size. Now, there's a superabundance of planet life on Chloris, so
Right. But who was the first person he met?
Right. And did she put the welfare of her struggling people above her own petty power? No. She's tipped the ambassador into a pit and threw astrologers at him.
Let's see if Erato agrees with me, shall we?
Well, it's very simple. Why don't you come over here, take hold of the communicator and we'll hear the truth from your larynx.
Come on, just take hold of the communicator.
She's dead.
Erato.
My pleasure.
Yes, yes, of course. Huntsman? See to it. It is a bit claustrophobic down here.
Don't say that.
I don't know. Just don't say it. Not yet.
I did, I did, and I discovered you're going to die of indigestion.
K9.
Good dog. Good dog. Adrasta's engineers should have Erato out of the Pit by now.
Well, yes. Then we should know the truth.
Well, only as much as he wants us to know until he's set free.
Why not?
He has no intention of crushing people.
Nonsense. He just wanted to talk.
Yes, talk, talk. After Adrasta stole his communicator he was just trying any way he could to make contact.
Yes we do. In an egg.
In an egg. When the shell's complete it's a blindingly simple space vehicle complete with photon drive.
Well, of course he's not going to leave it lying round where just anyone could take it. He protected it very carefully.
It was concealed in the pieces he kept hidden in the Pit.
Yes?
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. After he's told us whatever it is.
And before he reaches his space vehicle to escape.
Do remind me to give him back his photon drive.
Yes?
Exactly. Once he guarantees Chloris' safety, we'll let him have it back and then negotiate a proper trading agreement.
Yes.
Well?
Where is it?
Yes, I'm ready to speak to it. I just hope I'm ready to hear what it has to say to me.
Organon? Take this and guard it with your life. I don't want to take it anywhere near Erato until I want to give it to him. All right?
Romana, take the communicator. Right, Erato. Let's hear what you've got to tell us.
Well?
Oh do get on with it.
Shush. Romana, the communicator.
Yes, but now I've set you free, you can contact them all and call it off, yes?
Oh please, no more astrological mumbo-jumbo.
A neutron star.
I know what a neutron star is.
Bad? Chloris' sun will explode and your whole solar system will be destroyed. Is that bad?
Shush.
Ahem. But your machine is in pieces.
How long?
How long!
One hour, seven seconds. And you spin out this vessel from the threads in your own body like you did in the Pit?
And can you produce aluminium?
Erato, a thin shell of aluminium wrapped around a neutron star will minimise its gravitational pull and we can yank it back out of the sun's field.
Well, the Tardis. We can exert short bursts of enormous gravitational pull on the star, slow it up while you weave your eggshell round it, and then let go.
Right.
Erato, you came here for your own good and offered the deal to the wrong person. Will you now condemn an entire planet of innocent people to death?
I know I'm right. Well?
Good. Now this is what I
Oh well, it's a hypothetical question, my dear old thing.
Well, I took the precaution of removing your photon drive. Be a good girl, Romana.
I'm so sorry to butt in and at such a delicate moment, but if you're seriously thinking of taking over Chloris I think there's something you should know. In a very few hours, all that'll be left of it will be a few trillion tons of deep-fried rubble. Now, does that influence your thinking?
Wait! I'm talking about a shell fragment. If Erato doesn't get his ship launched within the hour, Chloris' sun will explode. How does that appeal? Still want to be scrap iron merchants?
Really? Look.
For what? For this heap of scrap iron?
Are you willing to sacrifice your life and the lives of everyone on this planet for wealth?
I thought you'd say that. K9!
Destroy it.
K9?
Good dog.
Now, would you like to tell me where that fragment is hidden?
Erato, can you hear me?
Have we picked up the neutron star yet?
Good.
I don't want to hear them.
Dematerialise now.
This is going to be very nasty.
You in position, Erato?
Gravity tractor beam, activate!
Deactivate tractor beam.
Yes, Erato?
Hold tight, everybody.
That's got it. Erato, get weaving! We're winning, Romana, we're winning.
How much longer, Erato?
Good.
The control circuit. I can't turn off the beam!
We're pulling the star towards us.
Erato, we did it!
What? Seventy four million three hundred and eighty four thousand three hundred and thirty eight? Well, that's extraordinary.
Well, that's my lucky number.
Handsome! Yes, yes, I know, Organon.
Are you in charge here now?
Good, good. Well, we've just dropped in to say goodbye and to give you this. It's from Erato.

Amy, Beaky, this could be the most exciting thing I have ever seen.
Because, assembled Ponds, this is not Earth. This has just been made to look like Earth. The craftsmanship involved. Can you imagine?
I don't know. Something must have yanked us off course. Look at the detail on that cheese plant!
Colonists maybe, recreating a bit of home, like when ex-pats open English pubs in Majorca. No, whoever did this, I am shaking his stroke her hand stroke tentacle.
I don't know. Let's find out.
Blimey, that was a bit quick.
She's threatening me with a chair leg.
I've never been threatened with a chair leg before. No, hang on, I tell a lie.
Oh, you're good. Oh, she's good. Amy, with regret, you're fired.
I'm kidding. (silent) We'll talk. (normal) I take it from the pathological compulsion to surrender, you're from Tivoli.
You with the face, Howie, you said you were surprised to be back in reception.
You, clever one. What's he talking about?
That's quite enough of that.
They're not doors, they're walls. Walls that look like doors. Door-walls, if you like, or dwalls. Woors even, though you'd probably got it when you said they're not doors. I mean, the windows are
Right, big day if you're a fan of walls.
Things? Hello! What kind of things? Interesting things? I love things, ask anyone.
Well, that killed the mood. How did you get here?
Ah.
So, what have we got. People snatched from their lives and dropped into an endless, shifting maze that looks like a 1980s hotel with bad dreams in the bedrooms.
Well, apart from anything else, that's just rude.
We'll pop back to the Tardis, I'll do a planet-wide diagnostic sweep, and then we'll have a sing song.
Okay, this is bad. At the moment, I don't know how bad, but certainly we're three buses, a long walk and eight quid in a taxi from good. Are there any more of you?
Doing what?
Hello. I'm the Doctor.
Well, they certainly didn't mention that in the brochure. Is Joe there? Can I have a quick word?
Well, you've been here two days. What's he waiting for?
But now you're what, cooked?
My room.
You said you'd seen the light now.
I think you should come with me.
Why you four? That's what I don't understand. Aside from all the other things I don't understand.
First, we find the Tardis. Quick thing before we go. If you feel drawn to a particular room, do not go in, and make sure someone else can see you at all times.
Something to add, Joe?
Hello.
Hey! Don't!
You're right. Keep telling yourself that. It's a CIA thing, nothing more.
No. No, I'm sure it isn't, but just in case, let's run away and hide anyway. In here.
Rory, come on!
Come on!
Eek!
Amy, get back. Why haven't they got us yet?
Amy, they're not real.
They should have got us by now. Amy, look at me. Focus on me. It's your bad dream, that's all.
I'm sorry, I just have to see what it is. I just have to see.
Oh, look at you. Oh, you are beautiful. Oh, dear.
I think it's going after Joe.
Leave him alone!
Joe!
Joe! Joe!
DOCTOR; Joe? Joe! Joe. Joe, what happened?
He died.
No! Well, yes, both, actually. I mean, there is no cause. All his vital organs simply stopped, as if the simple spark of life, his loves and hates, his faiths and fears were just taken, and this is a cup of tea.
But how did you make it?
Which is?
You're a Muslim.
Ha! You think this is Hell.
And all these fears and phobias wandering about, most are completely unconnected to us, so why are they still here?
Ha! I like you. You're a right clever clogs. But this isn't Hell, Rita.
Yeah. Sorry.
(reads) Er, my name is Lucy Hayward and I'm the last one left. It took Luke first. It got him on his first day, almost as soon as we arrived.
It's funny. You don't know what's going to be in your room until you see it, then you realise it could never have been
Anything else. I just saw mine. It was a gorilla from a book I'd read as a kid. My God, that thing used to terrify me. The gaps between my worships are getting shorter, like contractions.
Praise him.
What did you just say?
I won't leave you. I promise you. You have my word on that.
Hold it!
Thank you.
No. We stay together.
Your civilisation is one of the oldest in the galaxy. Now I see why. Your cowardice isn't quaint, it's sly, aggressive. It's how that gene of gutlessness has survived while so many others have perished. Well, not today. No one else dies today. Right? Brilliant. Howie, any second, it's going to possess you again. When it does, I'm going to ask you some questions. Please try to answer them.
Howie? Howie. Howie, you're next. We're all dead jealous. So, tell us. How do we get a piece of the action? Why isn't he possessing all of us?
It's as I thought. It feeds on fear. Everything, the rooms, Lucy's note, even the pictures in reception, has been put here to frighten us. So we have to resist it. Do whatever you have to. Cross your fingers, say a prayer, think of a basket of kittens, but do not give in to the fear.
We're going to catch ourselves a monster.
That's quite enough of that.
Nothing personal. I just think we should take things slowly. Get to know each other. You take people's most primal fears and pop it in a room. A tailor-made hell, just for them. Why?
Did you say they take? Ah, what is that word? The guard? No, the warden? This is a prison.
So what are we, cell mates? Lunch? We are not ripe. This is what Joe said, that we weren't ready. So, what, what, you make us ready. You what? Replace? Replace what, fear? You have lived so long even your name is lost. You want this to stop. Because you are just instinct. Then tell me. Tell me how to fight you.
No, no, no, no, no! Rory, watch out!
Stay back!
Pond, bring the fish.
Where'd he go?
Have you found your room yet?
Maybe you're not scared of anything.
You said that in the past tense.
Rita! Brilliant! How are you? Not panicking, are you? Good, good. Because I am literally an otter's toenail away from getting us out of here.
Excellent question. Excellent question. Why what?
Why is it up to you to save us? That's quite a God complex you have there.
I brought them here. They'd say it was their choice, but offer a child a suitcase full of sweets and they'll take it. Offer someone all of time and space and they'll take that, too. Which is why you shouldn't. Which is why grown-ups were invented.
Oh, yeah. And when we get out of this, I'll show you too.
Right down to the smallest detail. Got you, Mister Minotaur.
Of course. Who else?
Oh, you beauty. Come on, big fellow, where are you? Rita, where are you going?
Come on, come on, come on! Come on.
Rita, where are you going? Can you take the phone into the corridor? Will it reach?
You started to praise it, didn't you?
Rita, come back, please. We'll find a way to stop it, I swear to you.
No, no, no, you don't. The creature only wants whoever's praising it.
I'm coming to get you. Block out the fear and stay focused on your belief.
Rita. Rita, please. Let me find you.
Look, Rita. Rita. Go into the room. Lock the door.
No. No, no, Rita.
Rita!
Rita, please! Please! Please.
Okay. It preys on people's fear and possesses them. But Rita wasn't afraid. She was brave and calm. Maybe it's something to do with the people, some connection between the four of you that'll tell me how to fight it.
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
It's not fear. It's faith. Not just religious faith, faith in something. Howard believed in conspiracies, that external forces controlled the world. Joe had dice cufflinks and a chain with a horseshoe. He was a gambler. Gamblers believe in luck, an intangible force that helps them win or lose. Gibbis has rejected any personal autonomy and is waiting for the next batch of invaders to oppress him and tell him what to do. They all believe there's something guiding them, about to save them. That's what it replaces. Every time someone was confronted with their most primal fear, they fell back on their most fundamental faith. And all this time, I have been telling you to dig deep, find the thing that keeps you brave. I made you expose your faith, show them what they needed.
It doesn't want you. That's why it kept showing you a way out. You're not religious or superstitious, so there's no faith for you to fall back on. It wants her.
Your faith in me. That's what brought us here.
It needs to convert the faith into a form it can consume. Faith is an energy, the specific emotional energy the creature needs to live. Which is why at the end of her note, Lucy said
Exactly.
Amy? What are you doing?
I can't save you from this. There's nothing I can do to stop this.
I stole your childhood and now I've led you by the hand to your death. But the worst thing is, I knew. I knew this would happen. This is what always happens.
Forget your faith in me. I took you with me because I was vain. Because I wanted to be adored. Look at you. Glorious Pond, the girl who waited for me. I'm not a hero. I really am just a mad man in a box. And it's time we saw each other as we really are.
Amy Williams, it's time to stop waiting.
I severed the food supply, sacrificing their faith in me. I gave you the space to die. Shush, shush.
It's both, actually. Yeah. Here we go.
Distant cousin of the Nimon. They descend on planets and set themselves up as gods to be worshipped. Which is fine, until the inhabitants get all secular and advanced enough to build bonkers prisons.
No need for any. It's all automated. It drifts through space, snatching people with belief systems and converts their faith into food for the creature.
According to the in-flight recorder, the programme developed glitches. It got stuck on the same setting, the fears from the people before us weren't tidied away.
An ancient creature, drenched in the blood of the innocent, drifting in space through an endless, shifting maze. For such a creature, death would be a gift. Then accept it, and sleep well. I wasn't talking about myself.
No. Real Earth, real house, real door keys.
You showed me a picture of it once and said this is my favourite car.
You haven't seen the last of me. Bad Penny is my middle name. Seriously, the looks I get when I fill in a form, it's
Because you're still breathing.
I mean, you're right, there's still heaps of stuff out there to look at. Do you know, there's a planet whose name literally translates as Volatile Circus? Or maybe there's a bigger, scarier adventure waiting for you in there.
And what's the alternative? Me standing over your grave? Over your broken body? Over Rory's body?
And look after him.

Deadly to humans, maybe.
Oi! If you want aliens, you've got them. They're inside Downing Street. Come on!
I think you will find the Prime Minister is an alien in disguise. That's never going to work, is it?
Fair enough.
Well, now, yes, you see, er, the thing is, if I was you, if I was going to execute someone by backing them against the wall, between you and me, little word of advice.
Don't stand them against the lift!
Hello!
Out, with me!
Who the hell are you?
Nice to meet you.
We need to head to the Cabinet Room.
Harriet Jones, I like you.
One more move and my sonic device will triplicate the flammability of this alcohol. Whoof, we all go up. So back off.
Right then. Question time. Who exactly are the Slitheen?
Yes. I got that, thanks.
Can I have a bit of hush?
So, what's the plan?
I said hush. Come on. You've got a spaceship hidden in the North Sea. It's transmitting a signal. You've murdered your way to the top of government. What for, invasion?
Then something's brought the Slitheen race here. What is it?
So, you're family.
Then you're out to make a profit. How can you do that on a God-forsaken rock?
Is that what I said?
Ah, well! Nice try. Harriet, have a drink. I think you're gonna need it.
Sorry.
Fascinating history, Downing Street. Two thousand years ago, this was marsh land. 1730, it was occupied by a Mister Chicken. He was a nice man. 1796, this was the Cabinet Room. If the Cabinet's in session and in danger, these are about the four most safest walls in the whole of Great Britain. End of lesson.
Installed in 1991. Three inches of steel lining every single wall. They'll never get in.
Ah.
What was his name?
This one. The secretary or whatever he was called.
Sorry. Right, what have we got? Any terminals, anything?
He's too slim. They're big old beasts. They need to fit inside big humans.
That's the device around their necks. Compression field. Literally shrinks them down a bit. That's why there's all that gas. It's a big exchange.
Harriet Jones. I've heard that name before. Harriet Jones. You're not famous for anything, are you?
Rings a bell. Harriet Jones?
Say that again.
Anything. All of it.
Everything's important.
Well, they're just one family, so it's not an invasion. They don't want Slitheen World They're out to make money. That means they want to use something. Something here on Earth. Some kind of asset.
You're very good at this.
Harriet Jones. Why do I know that name?
Dead downstairs, yeah.
Oh, tell your stupid boyfriend we're busy.
Is that Ricky? Don't talk, just shut up and go to your computer.
Mickey the Idiot, I might just choke
Before I finish this sentence, but, er, I need you.
Say again.
Buffalo. Two Fs, one L.
Mickey, you were born in the dark.
Just repeat it every time.
Big Ben - why did the Slitheen go and hit Big Ben?
That lot would've gathered for a weather balloon. You don't need to crash land in the middle of London.
Now then, on the left at the top, there's a tab, an icon. Little concentric circles. Click on that.
The Slitheen have got a spaceship in the North Sea and it's transmitting that signal. Now hush, let me work out what it's saying.
It's some sort of message.
Don't know. It's on a loop, keeps repeating.
Hush!
It's beaming out into space, who's it for?
Mickey, I need that signal.
I'm trying!
Right, If we're going to find their weakness, we need to find out where they're from. Which planet. So, judging by their basic shape, that narrows it down to five thousand planets within travelling distance. What else do we know about them? Information!
Yep, narrows it down.
Narrows it down.
Narrows it down.
Narrows it down.
Narrows it down.
Narrows it down.
Calcium decay! Now, that narrows it down!
Calcium phosphate. Organic calcium. Living calcium. Creatures made out of living calcium. What else? What else? Hyphenated surname. Yes! That narrows it down to one planet. Raxacoricofallapatorius!
Get into the kitchen!
Calcium, weakened by the compression field. Acetic acid. Vinegar!
Just like Hannibal. Mickey, have you got any vinegar?
It's your kitchen.
Anything with vinegar!
And you kiss this man?
What?
He's making it up. There's no weapons up there, there's no threat. He just invented it.
That's why the Slitheen went for spectacle. They want the whole world panicking, because you lot, you get scared, you lash out.
And the Slitheen go nuclear.
You get the codes, release the missiles, but not into space because there's nothing there. You attack every other country on Earth. They retaliate, fight back. World War Three. Whole planet gets nuked.
Profit. That's what the signal is beaming into space. An advert.
At the cost of five billion lives.
I give you a choice. Leave this planet or I'll stop you.
Yes. Me.
There's a way out.
There's always been a way out.
Because I can't guarantee your daughter will be safe.
That's the thing. If I don't dare, everyone dies.
You don't even know what it is. You'd just let me?
Do you think I don't know that? Because this is my life, Jackie. It's not fun, it's not smart, it's just standing up and making a decision because nobody else will.
I could save the world but lose you.
We don't. We stay here.
Use the buffalo password. It overrides everything.
Right, we need to select a missile.
We don't need it. All we need's an ordinary missile.
What's the first category?
That's the one. Select.
You ready for this?
Mickey the idiot, the world is in your hands.
Fire.
Not solid enough. Built for short range attack, nothing this big.
Stop them intercepting it.
Good boy.
Maybe you should have a go.
I thought I knew the name. Harriet Jones, future Prime Minister. Elected for three successive terms. The architect of Britain's Golden Age.
Right, I'll be a couple of hours, then we can go.
You think I can travel
Through space and time and I haven't got a phone? Like I said, couple of hours. I've just got to send out this dispersal. There you go. That's cancelling out the Slitheen's advert in case any bargain hunters turn up.
Good. Put her on a slow heat and let her simmer.
I don't do that.
Tough. I've got better things to do.
Not to me it isn't.
Well, she's not mine.
Well, you can stay there if you want, but right now there's this plasma storm brewing in the Horsehead Nebula.
Fires are burning ten million miles wide.
I could fly the Tardis right into the heart of it then ride the shock wave all the way out.
Hurtle right across the sky and end up
Anywhere. Your choice.
Good lad. Graffiti that again and I'll have you. Now, beat it.
They're just not ready. You're happy to believe in something that's invisible, but if it's staring you in the face, nope, can't see it. There's a scientific explanation for that. You're thick.
Well, not all of you.
Present for you, Mickey.
That's a virus. Put it online. It'll destroy every mention of me. I'll cease to exist.
Because you're right, I am dangerous. I don't want anybody following me.
You could look after her. Come with us.
Got enough stuff?
No chance. He's a liability, I'm not having him on board.
My decision is final.

Canton. Amy. Amy!
Run!
Look behind you.
Look. Look. Canton, look, I tell you.
Why don't you ask her?
These bricks, what are they made of? Where is she?
I'd say zero balance dwarf star alloy. The densest material in the universe. Nothing gets through that. You're building me the perfect prison. And it still won't be enough.
Is there a reason you're doing this?
In a cell.
Good work, Canton. Door sealed?
Are you okay?
Exactly. Whatever they might think we're doing in here, they know we're not going anywhere.
Shall we?
Don't worry. She does that. Amy, Rory, open all the doors to the swimming pool.
So, we know they're everywhere. Not just a landing party, an occupying force, and they 'have been here a very, very long time. But nobody knows that, because no one can remember them.
No idea. But the good news is, we've got a secret weapon.
No, no. It's not Apollo 11. That would be silly. It's Neil Armstrong's foot.
Ha. So, three months. What have we found out?
Not just America, the entire world.
Are you okay?
Better?
As long as there's been something in the corner of your eye, or creaking in your house, or breathing under your bed, or voices through a wall. They've been running your lives for a very long time now, so keep this straight in your head. We are not fighting an alien invasion, we're leading a revolution. And today, the battle begins.
Like this.
(laughs) Nanorecorder. Fuses with the cartilage in your hand. (injects himself) Ow. And it tunes itself directly to the speech centres in your brain. It'll pick up your voice, no matter what. Telepathic connection. So, the moment you see one of the creatures, you activate it, and describe aloud exactly what you're seeing.
[OC]: And describe aloud exactly what you're seeing.
Because the moment you break contact, you're going to forget it happened. The light will flash if you've left yourself a message. You keep checking your hand if you've had an encounter. That's the first you'll know about it.
I did, but even information about these creatures erases itself over time. I couldn't refresh it because I couldn't talk to you.
What does it mean if the light's flashing? What did I just tell you?
Play it.
Keep eye contact with the creature and, when I say, turn back, and when you do, straighten my bow tie.
It's a hologram, extrapolated from the photo on Amy's phone. Take a good, long look.
You just saw an image of one of the creatures we're fighting. Describe it to me.
No. Neither can I. You straightened my bow tie because I planted the idea in your head while you were looking at the creature.
Now then, a little girl in a spacesuit. They got the suit from NASA, but where did they get the girl?
Except they'd probably stay close to that warehouse, because why bother doing anything else? And they'd take her from somewhere that would cause the least amount of attention. But you'll have to find her. I'm off to NASA.
Children's homes.
Amy.
How do you know?
Repeated memory wipes fry your head eventually. Find out what you can, but don't hang around.
Got to go. Got company.
Don't worry, I've put everything back the way I found it. Except this. There's always a bit left over, isn't there?
I told you. I'm on a top secret mission for the President.
I sent him a message.
(silent) Sorry.
Thank you. Bye, bye.
You have to tape everything that happens in this office. Every word, or you won't know if you're under the influence.
Thing. A clever thing. Now, no more questions. You have to trust me and nobody else.
Okay, gun down. I've got it.
Er, it defaults to live. This is current. Wherever she is right now, this is what she's saying.
She can't hear you. I'm so sorry. It's one way.
Okay. Who and what are you?
Rory, listen to that.
The Silence?
Who was she? Why put her in here?
Including the telephone network?
But why phone the President?
Purchased on earth. Perfectly ordinary stationery. Tardis blue. Summoned by a stranger who won't even show his face. That's a first, for me. How about you?
That's not really what I asked.
What are the Silence doing, raising a child?
The only way to save Amy is to work out what the Silence are doing.
And every single thing we learn about them brings us a step closer.
Of course, it's possible she's not just any little girl.
But?
Incredibly strong and running away. I like her.
Yes, I know. But how? Anyway, I have the strangest feeling she's going to find us.
Because that's what the Silence do. Think about it. They don't make anything themselves. They don't have to. They get other life forms to do it for them.
Superparasites, standing in the shadows of human history since the very beginning. We know they can influence human behaviour any way they want. If they've been doing that on a global scale for thousands of years.
Then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the Moon?
Because the Silence needed a spacesuit.
Why?
She'll be safe for now. No point in a dead hostage.
I can track that signal back. Take us right to her.
Because then what? I find her and then what do I do? This isn't an alien invasion. They live here. This is their empire. This is kicking the Romans out of Rome.
I know. I was there.
Personal question.
Do you ever remember it? Two thousand years, waiting for Amy? The last Centurion.
You're lying.
Of course you are. Not the sort of thing anyone forgets.
Oh, interesting. Very Aickman Road. I've seen one of these before. Abandoned. I wonder how that happened? Oh, well I suppose I'm about to find out. Rory, River, keep one Silent in eyeshot at all times. Oh, hello. Sorry, you were in the middle of something. I just had to say, though, have you seen what's on the telly? Oh, hello, Amy. Are you all right? Want to watch some television? Ah. Now, stay where you are. Because look at me, I'm confident. You want to watch that, me, when I'm confident. Oh, and this is my friend River. Nice hair, clever, has her own gun, and unlike me, she really doesn't mind shooting people. I shouldn't like that. Kind of do, a bit.
I know you're team players and everything, but she'll definitely kill at least the first three of you.
Seven? Really?
Stop it.
Yeah? Well, maybe I will.
Yes. Right. Sorry. As I was saying, my naughty friend here is going to kill the first three of you to attack, plus him behind, so maybe you want to draw lots or have a quiz.
Or maybe you could just listen a minute. Because all I really want to do is accept your total surrender and then I'll let you go in peace. Yes, you've been interfering in human history for thousands of years. Yes, people have suffered and died, but what's the point in two hearts, if you can't be a bit forgiving, now and then? Ooo, the Silence. You guys take that seriously, don't you? Okay, you got me. I'm lying. I'm not really going to let you go that easily. Nice thought, but it's not Christmas. First, you tell me about the girl. Who is she? Why is she important? What's she for?
Guys, sorry, but you're way out of time. Now, come on. A bit of history for you. Aren't you proud? Because you helped. Now, do you know how many people are watching this live on the telly? Half a billion. And that's nothing, because the human race will spread out among the stars. You just watch them fly. Billions and billions of them, for billions and billions of years, and every single one of them at some point in their lives, will look back at this man, taking that very first step, and they will never, ever forget it.
Oh. But don't forget this bit. Ready?
You've given the order for your own execution, and the whole planet just heard you.
And one whacking great kick up the backside for the Silence. You just raised an army against yourself and now, for a thousand generations, you're going to be ordering them to destroy you every day. How fast can you run? Because today's the day the human race throw you off their planet. They won't even know they're doing it. I think, quite possibly, the word you're looking for right now is oops. Run! Guys, I mean us. Run.
Don't let them build to full power.
Helping.
That's really rude.
You can let me fly it.
Safe? No, of course you're not safe. There's about a billion other things out there just waiting to burn your whole world. But, if you want to pretend you're safe, just so you can sleep at night? Okay, you're safe. But you're not really. Canton. Until the next one, eh?
Canton just wants to get married. Hell of a reason to kick him out of the FBI.
I'm counting on you.
I should warn you I don't answer a lot of questions.
Oh, Dicky. Tricky Dicky. They're never going to forget you. Say hi to David Frost for me.
You could come with us.
Okay. Up to you. See you next time. Call me.
Have I forgotten something?
Right. Okay. Interesting.
We haven't.
Oh, look at the time. Must be off. But it was very nice. It was, it was good. It was er, unexpected. You know what they say. There's a first time for everything.
Rory, I'm going to need thermocouplings. The green ones and blue ones.
So.
You're okay?
After effect of the Silence. Natural enough. That's not what I was asking. You told me you were pregnant.
Why?
No, why did you tell me?
Hmm. Did you tell Rory?
Amy, why tell me and not Rory?
What's a timehead?
A timehead.
So, this little girl. It's all about her. Who was she? Or we could just go off and have some adventures. Anyone in the mood for adventures? Because I am. You only live once.

Behold, Rio.
No? Ooo, feel that, though. What's that?
Ground feels strange. Just me. Wait. That's weird.
Blue grass. Patches of it all around the graveyard. So, Earth, 2020-ish, ten years in your future, wrong continent for Rio, I'll admit, but it's not a massive overshoot.
Can't be.
It is. It's you two.
Ten years in your future. Come to relive past glories, I'd imagine. Humans, you're so nostalgic.
Er, no, best not. Really best not. These things get complicated very quickly, and oh look. Big mining thing. Oh, I love a big mining thing. See, way better than Rio. Rio doesn't have a big mining thing.
Let's go and have a look. Come on, you two, let's see what they're doing.
Restricted access. No unauthorised personnel. Hmm.
What did I break? Sonicking and entering. Totally different.
You're sure Rory'll catch us up?
What about now? Can you feel it now?
The ground doesn't feel like it should.
Good thought, but no, it doesn't. Hear that, drill in start-up mode. Afterwaves of a recent seismological shift and blue grass.
No, that's recent. What's in
Here? Hello.
Ministry of Drills, Earth and Science. New Ministry, quite big, just merged. It's lot of responsibility on our shoulders. Don't like to talk about it. What are you doing?
Where are you getting these readings from?
Why's there a big patch of earth in the middle of your floor?
Good. Right. You all need to get out of here very fast.
What's your name?
Look at the screens, Nasreen. Look at your readings. It's moving.
Shouldn't think so. It's shifting when it shouldn't be shifting.
The ground, the soil, the earth, moving. But how? Why?
Doubt it, because it's only happening under this room.
It knows we're here. It's attacking. The ground's attacking us.
Under the circumstances, I'd suggest, run!
Stay back, Amy. Stay away from the earth.
Amy!
Stay away from it.
I've got you.
Never.
Stay calm. Keep hold of my hand. Don't let go. Your drill, shut it down. Go. Now!
Amy, try and stay calm. If you struggle, it'll make things worse. Keep hold of my hand.
I'm not going to let you go.
Stay calm. Now, hold on till they can just shut down the drill.
Amy, concentrate. Don't you give up.
No. Amy! Amy, no!
No! No! No! No! No. No! No. No. No. No. (etc etc)
She's gone. The ground took her.
It's not quicksand. She didn't just sink. Something pulled her in. It wanted her.
You said the ground was dormant. Just a patch of earth, when you first saw it this morning. And the drill had been stopped.
But when you re-started the drill, the ground fought back.
I'm not saying that, and it's not ridiculous, I just don't think it's right. Oh, of course. It's bio-programming.
Bio-programming. Oh, it's clever. You use bio-signals to resonate the internal molecular structure of natural objects. It's mainly used in engineering and construction, mostly jungle planets, but that's way in the future and not here. What's it doing here?
Excuse me, I'm making perfect sense. You're just not keeping up. The earth, the ground beneath our feet, was bio-programmed to attack.
Stop you drilling. Okay, so we find whatever's doing the bio-programming, we can find Amy. We can get her back. Shush, shush, shush. Have I gone mad? I've gone mad.
Shush, shush. Silence. Absolute silence. You've stopped the drill, right?
And you've only got the one drill?
You're sure about that?
So, if you shut the drill down, why can I still hear drilling? It's under the ground.
Hacking into your records. Probe reports, samples, sensors. Good. Just unite the data, make it all one big conversation. Let's have a look. So, we are here and this is your drill hole. Twenty one point zero zero nine kilometres. Well done.
Why here, though? Why'd you drill on this site?
The blue grass? Oh, Nasreen. Those trace minerals weren't X marking the spot, saying dig here. They were a warning. Stay away. Because while you've been drilling down, somebody else has been drilling up.
Oh, beautiful. Network of tunnels all the way down.
You only saw what you went looking for.
Heat signals. Wait, dual readings, hot and cold, doesn't make sense. And now they're moving. Fast. How many people live nearby?
Grab this equipment and follow me.
That noise isn't a drill, it's transport. Three of them, thirty kilometres down. Rate of speed looks about a hundred and fifty kilometres an hour. Should be here in ooo, quite soon. Twelve minutes. Whatever bio-programmed the Earth is on its way up, now.
You saw the readings.
No, no, no.
Energy signal originating from under the Earth. We're trapped.
Not now, Rory. Energy barricade, invisible to the naked eye. We can't get out and no one from the outside world can get in.
Er, no. Those energy patterns would play havoc with the circuits. With a bit of time, maybe, but we've only got nine and a half minutes.
Get everyone inside the church. Rory, I'll get her back.
She was taken. Into the Earth.
I tried. I promise, I tried.
I'll find Amy. I'll keep you all safe, I promise. Come on, please. I need you alongside me.
Yes. If we move quickly enough, we can be ready.
Me.
Yes. But I need you to trust me and do exactly as I say from this second onwards, because we're running out of time.
Thank you. We have eight minutes to set up a line of defence. Bring me every phone, every camera, every piece of recording or transmitting equipment you can find.
Every burglar alarm, every movement sensor, every security light. I want the whole area covered with sensors.
Right, guys, we need to be ready for whatever's coming up. I need a map of the village marking where the cameras are going.
Oh, that's all right, I can't make a decent meringue. Draw like your life depends on it, Elliot.
Good lad.
Resources. Every little helps. Meals on wheels. What've you got here, then. Warmer in the front, refrigerated in the back.
What are those?
No, no weapons. It's not the way I do things.
Oh, Ambrose, you're better than this. I'm asking nicely. Put them away.
Look at that. Perfect. Dyslexia never stopped Da Vinci or Einstein. It's not stopping you.
Two phase plan. First, the sensors and cameras will tell us when something arrives. Second, if something does arrive, I use this to send a sonic pulse through that network of devices. A pulse which would temporarily incapacitate most things in the universe.
Lovely place to grow up round here.
I was the same where I grew up.
Yeah.
So much.
Yeah.
No, they're scared of me.
No question.
How're you doing?
Shutting out light from within the barricade. Trying to isolate us in the dark. Which means
It's here.
Any time you want to help.
It doesn't do wood.
Oi, don't diss the sonic.
See if we can get a fix.
It's deliberate.
Nothing. We've got nothing. They sent an energy surge to wreck our systems.
It's coming through the final layer of Earth.
I did.
He said he was going to get headphones.
Ambrose, don't go running off!
What happened?
Get him into the church now.
I don't think so. They've taken three people when they could've just killed them up here. There's still hope, Ambrose. There is always hope.
I don't know. I'll find Elliot, I promise. But first I've got to stop this attack. Please, get inside the church.
Cold blood. I know who they are.
Defending the planet with meals on wheels.
Sounds like they're leaving.
I don't think so. Now both sides have hostages.
So, I think I've met these creatures before. Different branch of the species, mind, but all the same. Let's see if our friend's thawed out.
Very sure.
Venom gland takes at least twenty four hours to recharge. Am I right? I know what I'm doing. I'll be fine.
I'm the Doctor. I've come to talk. I'm going to remove your mask.
You are beautiful. Remnant of a bygone age on planet Earth. And by the way, lovely mode of travel. Geothermal currents projecting you up through a network of tunnels. Gorgeous. Mind if I sit? Now. Your people have a friend of mine. I want her back. Why did you come to the surface? What do you want? Oh, I do hate a monologue. Give us a bit back. How many are you?
Really. No. Last of the species. The Klempari Defence. As an interrogation defence, it's a bit old hat, I'm afraid.
No. You're really not. Because I'm the last of my species and I know how it sits in a heart. So don't insult me. Let's start again. Tell me your name.
How long has your tribe been sleeping under the Earth, Alaya? It's not difficult to work out. You're three hundred million years out of your comfort zone. Question is, what woke you now?
The drill.
Do we have to say vermin? They're really very nice.
Extraordinary species. You attack them, they'll fight back. But, there's a peace to be brokered here. I can help you with that.
Doesn't give you automatic rights to it now, I'm afraid. Humans won't give up the planet.
You underestimate them.
One tribe of homo reptilia against six billion humans? You've got your work cut out.
Tell me where my friend is. Give us back the people who were taken.
I'm not going let you provoke a war, Alaya. There'll be no battle here today.
Not while I'm here.
I'm going to go down below the surface, to find the rest of the tribe, to talk to them.
They're not aliens. They're Earth-liens. Once known as the Silurian race, or, some would argue, Eocenes, or Homo Reptilia. Not monsters, not evil. Well, only as evil as you are. The previous owners of the planet, that's all. Look, from their point of view, you're the invaders. Your drill was threatening their settlement. Now, the creature in the crypt. Her name's Alaya. She's one of their warriors, and she's my best bargaining chip. I need her alive. If she lives, so do Elliot and Mo and Amy, because I will find them. While I'm gone, you four people, in this church, in this corner of planet Earth, you have to be the best of humanity.
No dissecting, no examining. We return their hostage, they return ours, nobody gets harmed. We can land this together, if you are the best you can be. You are decent, brilliant people. Nobody dies today. Understand?
No, sorry, no. What are you doing?
Sort of, but you're not coming with me.
I don't have time to argue.
It'll be dangerous.
Oh, for goodness sake. All right, then. Come on.
Welcome aboard the Tardis. Now, don't touch anything. Very precious.
Everything. I'm hoping, if we're going down, that barricade won't interfere.
Did you touch something?
I'm not doing anything. We've been hijacked. I can't stop it. They must've sensed the electro-magnetic field. They're pulling the Tardis down into the Earth.
Looks like we fell through the bottom of their tunnel system. Don't suppose it was designed for handling something like this.
Oh, a lot more than twenty one kilometres.
Don't know. Interesting, isn't it?
Not every day. Every other day.
We're looking for a small tribal settlement probably housing around a dozen Homo Reptilia? Maybe less.
Yeah.
Ah.
Maybe more than a dozen. Maybe more like an entire civilisation living beneath the Earth.

Yes, you're the very next thing on the list.
Clara, I'm under attack from four and a bit battle fleets
In case you think I'm slacking.
Yes, that's possible, actually. You were too long in the spider mines.
It's possibly a Love Sprite. Sucks your brain (boom) sucks your brain out through your mouth, hence the name.
Don't worry, it's just hungry.
Describe the four most interesting stars you can see.
Colour of whisky, smaller one blinking?
Great! I thought asphyxiation would kill you first. Can you see a nebula? Can you see a nebula in a sort of wing-shape? Bit green at the end?
Great, I've seen it too. I wondered where it was.
Oh, not a word about my spot-on materialisation skills.
Huh? Oh, yeah. Well, I lured their attackers halfway across the  universe and drained their weapons banks. Not to mention, I also saved a school teacher from having her brains devoured and being  asphyxiated in deep space. So, now, if you don't mind, I'm going to go outside and wipe my boot on the grass.
Nothing. But the Velosians will be ready for them this time. It's the  best I could do, Clara. I'm not actually the police, that's just what it says on the box.
We're time travellers. We tread softly. It's okay to make ripples, but not tidal waves.
Don't say that.
No, no, not Vikings. I'm not in the mood for Vikings.
No, I'm not. Do you want to know why?
On my face, right now, more advanced technology than your species will manage over the next nine million years.
Clara?
We're going with the Vikings.
I do have a plan.
Well, only because you were looking worried.
I do have a plan.
Never seen her before in my life.
I don't know. Nothing, probably. Too much time travel, it happens.
People talk about premonition as if it's something strange. It's not. It's just remembering in the wrong direction.
We meet the boss man and we do the usual.
Replace him.
To the primitive mind, advanced technology can seem like magic.
Yeah. It's in my pocket somewhere.
Magic.
I am very, very cross with you. I am very disappointed. I have taken human form to walk among you.
Do you not recognise the sign of Odin?
Oh, and you would know that how, exactly? Have you met Odin? Do you know what Odin looks like?
Do not believe this foolish trickery!
It's supposed to do that.
Stay still. Stay very, very still.
He hasn't even got a yo-yo.
Shh. No, this is a harvest. The strongest, the fittest. The weak and young, they'll leave behind.
We have to not get chosen.

(sotto) Clara.
Clara! Clara!
Oh, stop it! All of you, stop it right now. Homo sapiens, you're an intelligent species. Stop lying to yourselves.
Yes, I am a false Odin. That's exactly right, I lied. The big fella in the sky, he lied too. You all know it. Because what's the one thing that gods never do? Gods never actually show up!
Clara?
Clara! Clara! Clara!
I'm not a hugger. Ahh! Let's hug!
I looked them up in my two thousand year diary.
They are called the Mire.
They are one of the deadliest warrior races in the entire galaxy
But they're practical. They get what they want and go. You persuaded them to go, didn't you? I knew that you would.
One of them, yes. Why?
What bad luck? You haven't had any bad luck. You're fine.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. With a whole day to spare! So leave! Hop it, take off! Into the woods, split up, hide.  Hang about there for a week, come back home, make puddings and babies. That's basically what you do, isn't it?
Yes, you can. Just pick a  direction. Fly like a bird, run like a nose. That's probably a Viking  saying, I haven't checked that.
Really? Well, I don't know if you remember, but they actually took away all your fighters. So, what are you? Farmers, fishermen, web designers. Maybe not that last one.
Okay, tell me this. How many people here have actually held a sword in battle? By a show of hands? Mmm hmm. Yeah, baby.
The Mire are coming for each and every one of you. (throws the  sword down again) So what you going to do? Raise crops at them?
Do babies die with honour?
I am afraid, Mother. Hold me, Mother. I am afraid.
Turn your face towards me,  Mother, for you're, you're beautiful. And I will sing for you. I am  afraid, but I will sing. Babies think that laughter is singing. Did you  know that? I applaud your courage, but I deplore your stupidity. And I  will mourn your deaths, which will be terrifying, painful, and without honour.
I told you to run. That's all the help you need. And that's all the help you're getting.
The earth is safe, humanity is not in danger. It's just one village.
Suppose I saved it by some miracle. No Tardis, no sonic. Just one  village defeats the Mire. What then? Word gets around. Earth becomes a  target of strategic value, and the Mire come back. And God knows what  else. Ripples into tidal waves until everybody dies.
She. She's afraid.  Babies sense danger. They have to.
Mother, I hear thunder. Mother, I hear  shouting. You are my world, but I hear other worlds now. Beyond the  unfolding of your smile, is there other kindness? I'm afraid. Will they  be kind? The sky is crying now. Fire in the water. Fire in the water?
So, when I say move, you move. When I say jump, you say how high? Unless it's across a gap of some kind which, of course, means you jump horizontally. Yes, what is it, Lofty?
No, it's not, it's Lofty. I've got too much to think about without  everybody having their own names, so it's Lofty. You're Lofty, you're Daphne, (bushy black beard) you're Noggin the Nog, (old man in a  too-large helmet) ZZ Top (bushy ginger beard and bald head) and you're er,  Heidi. So, we'll try that again. Lofty, what is it?
Yes, perhaps you'd like to field this one, Limpy?
That's right, yes. You'll be given your real swords back when you can prove that you can wave them around without lopping bits off yourselves. Heidi, why are your eyes closed?
No of course you're not.
Enough theory. I'm handing out the real swords.
Well, that could have gone better.
Morning.
The Big Bang, dinosaurs, bipeds, and a mounting sense of futility.
That's not thunder. It's the weapon forges of the Mire. They're making sure we hear them.
Well, Heidi faints at the mention of blood, not  just the sight any more. He's actually upgraded his phobia. Chuckles, (he means Einarr) he questions every single order you give  him, which is going to be a little bit difficult, a little bit tricky, in the heat of battle.
Teaching them to fight, that's the only plan I've got.
Yeah. I used to believe that too.
You. Oh, Clara Oswald what have I made of you?
They'll die fighting with honour. To a Viking, that's all the difference in the world.
A good death is the best anyone can hope for, unless you happen to be immortal.
Night.
Stop it.
The human race, you're obsessed. You all need to get a hobby.
Well, get a new one.
Tomorrow it's going to be a bloodbath.
These people all died hundreds of years before you were born
I have a duty of care.
Every time we do something like this, I keep thinking, what if something happens to you?
What?
What's that? Is that a puppet? Oh, I love puppets!
Frightened?
Because if you make up the right story, then you think it will keep them safe and they'll all come home. That's okay. You're not the first person to ever have done that.
I'm looking for something I'm missing. What do you think our chances are tomorrow?
Yeah.
You could go.
Oh, I like a nice view as much as anyone.
Can't wait for the next one.
I will mourn for you. I know which I'd prefer.
What, you mean the rest of the universe? Basically, yes, I do.
Good. Good. But that won't save you.
No. No. No, you go ahead and you cry all you like. Speaking of crying,  is that baby getting closer?
Why has Lofty stolen a baby?
Oh. Where's he taking her?
Why would she? Fire in the water. Fire in the water. Fire in the  Fire in the water. Fire in the water? Fire in the water! That's it. That's it. That's what I've been missing. Clara, I've found  it!
Clara! Clara!
Lofty! I had no idea that was your baby. Hello, baby, I had no idea this was your junior parent.
Chuckles, bedtime is cancelled. Everybody, off the hard stuff. We've  got a long night's work ahead of us. I need a blacksmith. Who's the blacksmith?
You're the blacksmith and you've got a baby too? He's been at it hammer and tongs.
There's going to be a war tomorrow. And here's some news, this just in. We're going to win the hell out of it.
Ashildr, this is your village, and you will never have to leave it, I swear.
I told you that we were basically doomed. Did no one in this two-horn town think to mention that you had eels?
I give you fire in the water!
Electric eels!
Yes, yes! I know exactly how you feel. Well, not exactly. She needs changing.
And it is a doozy!
We need to pull that silvery stuff out of Clara's space suit. We  can use it to magnify the electrical charge. Stop looking confused! Look happy! Winning is all  about looking happier than the other guy. Always walk briskly. Makes you a moving target. Oh, that's for Lofty.  Lofty! (he throws something) And talk with confidence, even if you're terrified.
Act as if you  know their plan, and sometimes, if you're very lucky, they'll actually tell you it. Ah, this is for Ashildr. (a blanket)
Then we deploy the anvil. Now, at this stage, getting me one of their  helmets is key. We get a helmet, and this is over. Then we can mop up  the rest using Ashildr's monstrosity.
(grinning) I know.
Hey, hello, hi! I'm the Doctor. It's lovely to meet you face to  er convincing hologram.  You could always go zzz and get rid of it, no? No,  on second thoughts, don't. That, that, that suits you.
No, no, no. We decided against that. We thought we'd just have a party!
We're unarmed. There isn't a single weapon in this room. Which I'm sure  your systems are telling you. You wouldn't open fire on unarmed  civilians, would you?
Chuckles,
Run, run, run-run-run-run! That's four down, six left.
DOCTOR; Chuckles, switch!
Chuckles, off!
Reversing the polarity of the neutron flow. I bet that means something. It sounds great.  Ashildr!
Are you ready?
You were born for this. Show them a story they'll never forget.
See how they run.
That's enough, Ashildr. Story's over. Happy ending.
Ha! Says the man with a fake face. But you see, that's the  trouble with viewing reality through technology. It's all too easy to  feed in a new reality.
A story to save a town, and a puppet from a nightmare. You see,  you've just seen the world through the eyes of a storyteller.  The mighty armies of the Mire. Brutal, sadistic, undefeated. Even I  believed the stories. But after today, no one will again. An army like yours, it lives or dies  on its reputation, its story. And today, you were sent packing by a handful of farmers and fisherman.  Not to mention the whole wetting your pants and running away from a  puppet debacle.
That was hilarious. It's just lucky that nobody recorded that. Oh. Wait a minute, we did.
The Benny Hill theme, yes. Now, you see, we could just keep this as a  funny little film and play it every year at the Christmas party,
If you don't leave right now, I'll put it out there for all to see and no one will fear you again.
Oh, I hacked your teleporter. Sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm really terribly sorry.
Yeah. I plugged her into the machine. Used her up like a battery. (sighs) I'm so sick of losing.
I don't mean the war. I'll lose any war you like. I'm sick of losing people.  Look at you, with your eyes, and your never giving up, and your anger, and your kindness. One day, the memory of that will hurt so much that I won't be able to breathe, and I'll do what I always do. I'll get in my box and I'll run and I'll run, in case all the pain ever catches up. And every place I go, it will be there.
I can do
My face.
Who frowned me this face? Why this one? Why did I choose this face?
I think I know why I chose it.
It's like I'm trying to tell myself something.
I think I know what I'm trying to say.
Come with me.
I know where I got this face, and I know what it's for.
To remind me. To hold me to the mark. I'm the Doctor, and I save people.
And if anyone happens to be listening, and you've got any kind of a problem with that, to hell with you!
It's from the Mire helmet. Battlefield medical kit. I've reprogrammed it for human beings.
It's repairing her. It will never stop repairing her,  if it works. Come on, Ashildr. Come on. The story's not over yet.
She'll be conscious in a day, up and about in three. No swimming for a  week. Now, we're going to need a longboat and some of your best rowers.  We're two days' sail from the Tardis.
Oh, no. Well, she'll, she'll see me often enough once she understands.
Second dose.
No, no, no, it's not for her.
Er, whoever she wants.
Oh, don't thank me yet, Ashildr. Not yet.
It won't stop, the repair kit I put inside Ashildr, not ever. It'll just keep fixing her.
I'm not sure, but it's entirely possible she has lost the ability to die.
Oh, dying is an ability, believe me. Barring accidents, she may now be functionally immortal.
Immortality isn't living forever. That's not what it feels like. Immortality is everybody else dying. She might meet someone she can't bear to lose. That happens, I believe.
I was angry. I was emotional. Just possibly, I have made a terrible mistake. Maybe even a tidal wave.
Time will tell, it always does.
Yes. Yes, she did. But Ashildr isn't just human any more. There's a little piece of alien inside her, so in a way, she's. In a way, she's a hybrid.

What is it?
We're in trouble. I'll explain later.
What was Nyssa working on?
The rotor's jamming. Well, there's a safety cut out.
Well, we'll see. I'm trying to refocus the exterior viewer on the interior of the Tardis.
Dimensional instability, that's the danger. Nyssa!
Nyssa, can you hear me?
Stay well back. There's nothing you can do. Nyssa?
Oh, no. The outside universe is breaking through.
Look behind you, Nyssa.
Go through, Nyssa. It's your only chance.
I don't know, but if she stays in the room, she'll die.
Nyssa, if you can hear me,
Keep moving. Keep moving, Nyssa. Stay ahead of it. If you don't, it will kill you.
I don't know.
Another spacecraft.
The Tardis found it. There's a fail-safe. On impending break-up, it seeks out and locks onto the nearest spacecraft.
Well, it never worked before.
She's gone. Stay there.
What have I sent you into, Nyssa?
Nyssa.
I think it's some sort of old passenger liner.
Yes, well, some people have the strangest ideas about decor. Come on, let's get back to the Tardis.
Ah. I don't remember this. We must have taken a wrong turn.
A massive plug. The hull must have been damaged at some time.
Yes, I know. Come on, we'll try, er, this way.
Er, this way.
Certainly not.
Oh, dear. So sorry, I didn't know it was private.
We have a ship of our own.
Unarmed?
Hardly.
Neither is that.
Raiders, by the look of it. Probably an advance party to open the airlocks.
Yes.
I think not.
Stop bluffing. You haven't got a chance. Listen to the engines. Alignment manoeuvres. We're docking with another ship.
If you put the guns away, please.
Thank you.
I think we should get out of here. Follow me.
Whatever you do, don't let them touch you.
No! That would be mass slaughter.
Look at them. I doubt if they can feed themselves, let alone fight.
No. I rather think he's got a lot to tell us.
Dying. Some cargo you came to steal.
Indeed.
Now, what about Terminus? We must find Olvir.
In a moment. Can you see any more computer blocks?
Information about Terminus. There must be something here, the liner's just docked with it.
Star charts.
Must be Terminus. Nyssa?
What do you make of this?
Nyssa's right. How do you know about Lazar's disease?
On Terminus?
And you didn't try and find out why?
What do you make of this?
In all you heard about Terminus, was there ever any comment on its position?
There's something very strange about this.
Well, it could be pure coincidence, but Terminus seems to be at the exact centre of the known universe.
This could be useful. Plan of the ship.
It's no wonder we got lost.
Look.
We must get out of here.
We can't have missed the door. There was a book lying on the floor.
Nyssa's skirt. There's blood on it. Call Olvir, quickly.
More spots of blood. Try them again.
That's the wave pattern the Tardis homed in on.
Someone's calling.
Stage two sterilisation. Come on!
Down there.
The centre of the universe.
Then why don't they reply? Tell me. The star charts on the liner, do you think they were accurate?
Let her go!
I'd appreciate some help.
No. He's wearing radiation armour. Keep him covered.
Come on.
Let me have your radio.
Well, at least the level's acceptable, for the time being. Come on.
Why do the crew put up with such a radiation leak?
Olvir said there wasn't one. So, why don't they repair it?
Hmm. Radiation. Fallout. Now that's a thought.
Nothing. Just an idea worth pursuing.
What is it?
Well, he seems happy enough. Let's find out.
He's hurt. Hello, I'm the Doctor. Can I help?
Terminus entrance. At least we know where the radiation comes from.
Look at the damage. Easy now.
Indeed. I'm the Doctor.
A little.
In what way?
Chain reaction.
When?
Some sort of signal.
Come on.
The control lines. The ones Bor said he followed.
Yes, you're right about the sickness. I want to find out what he discovered.
I think it could be rather important.
Terminus control.
Do you remember Bor saying one of the engines had exploded?
He was wrong. It didn't come to that. Look at this. Terminus was once capable of time travel.
Well, to push a ship of this size through time would require an enormous amount of energy.
Well, think about what we've learnt. Terminus seems to be at the centre of the universe, yes? Now, imagine this ship in flight. Suddenly the pilot finds he has an enormous amount of unstable fuel on board. What would you do?
Perfectly normal procedure. Unfortunately, he ejects his fuel into a void.
Starting a chain reaction.
Enormous. Biggest explosion of all time. Event One.
Yes.
A chemical reaction in a primeval swamp can create life on a planet. Why couldn't the universe be created by a similar chance factor, hmm?
It only appears simple because the circumstances were exactly right.
Well, the pilot time-jumped the ship forward before realising how unstable the fuel was. The resulting shockwave must have caught up with him, boosting the ship billions of years into the future.
Yes.
Not quite. Whereas the first explosion created the universe, the second would undoubtedly destroy it.
I don't know. Oh, no.
It wasn't the pilot's decision. The computer's just started an automatic sequence to jettison the unstable fuel. If we don't do something quickly, the whole universe will be destroyed.
We must stop the sequence.
Not yet.
It's controlled by the computer, and the computer's uncontrollable.
The technology here is phenomenal, unfortunately. There must be a way to reset that handle.
A giant.
The Garm.
Well, we can only hope there is.
You ready?
Let's just get into the control room. I'll do the rest.
We'll humour him. Right, let's go.
You understand what we need you to do?
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry.
If you can return the lever, I can disconnect the computer controlling it.
It's the end of the universe.
It must. You must push harder. It's the only way.
That's it!
Indeed you have.
Rest. You've earned it. Come on.
Disconnect the control lines to the engines.
Look, whoever you are, we haven't got time for
You're taking a very narrow view of all this.
You're quite happy to see things go on as they are.
Things could change.
Nyssa, I've been so worried.
How do you know?
Well, you think it could be?
Well, he has it now.
Where is it?
It's locked. Olvir, may I borrow your laser?
You're the expert, what do you think?
Look, er, while we're sorting things out here, perhaps you'd be so good as to cut the control lines to the engines. I'd hate anyone to start the sequence manually.
Think you can synthesise it?
How do you do? I'm the Doctor, and this is Nyssa.
Yes, well, before you start, perhaps one of you could show us the way to the damaged engine. There's still a great deal to be done.
It'll be good to see the Tardis again.
Yes, well, it'll be nice to know she's safe. Tegan!
What are you doing?
I told you not to follow me.
Yes, well, I'm pleased to see her but she shouldn't have followed us.
Yes, well, we'll talk about it later. Valgard?
Now it's important you inform the authorities about what's been going on here. Make it impossible for Terminus Incorporated to retaliate. For example, you must make contact with the pick-up ship.
The one that takes the cured Lazars away. Well, the Garm will know all about it.
Then speak to him, win his confidence. You'll find him very agreeable.
What is it?
What?
Well, you can't stay. It isn't safe. Certainly not until the Vanir have sorted out how they're to run Terminus.
You do fully understand the commitment you'll be undertaking?
And that life here will be very hard.
Then you're a very brave person. I wish you every luck.
Turlough? Turlough!

You'll find out.
Nae man can tether time nor tide. Robert Burns.
Oh, I should have remembered.
Well to Jamie, its 1746. Robert Burns wasn't born until 1759.
Hold tight, everyone.
Ah, that's the fun. Stand by, here we go.
Prehistoric monsters.
Yes, I don't see why not. It looks all right to me. (The doors open.) Wait!
For me.
All right then, where are we?
Haven't a clue. Not the isles of Britain, anyway.
This rock. It's volcanic. It's not very old either.
Oh, miocene.
It's only about 25 million years old. Look.
Possibly, possibly.
Mediterranean. Oh no, tidal sea, can't be. That's funny, it hasn't been fired long.
So they caught you too.
That we shall find out very soon.
Yes, we must be below sea level already.
Here we are.
Yes, well, don't be frightened anybody. If we pass out it's compressed nitrogen. It's called caissons disease.
Oh.
Troglodytes.
Ancient tribes from North Africa who lived in caves. Possibly, possibly. Where's my diary?
Yes, it's difficult to put a precise date on these people.
All right then, when?
Can you prove it?
Oh, how interesting, yes. Hmm. It's Aztec. Fake of course.
Yes, well, that means move in any language. I think we'd better comply. Women and children last. Polly?
Oh food.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you.
This is good.
This is very good. Mmmm. It's delicious. This is excellent. Sit down, sit down. This is ambrosia.
Plankton.
Well, it's small plants and animals from the sea.
You'd better get used to it. I don't expect there's much else to be had around here. Visitors!
Good day to you.
And she had a message about us? For you?
And just what part are we to play in this festival of the vernal equinox?
No! Wait! I have something important to say.
I won't speak under threats!
What will happen to them?
You'll have to go, Polly.
What I have to say concerns a certain Professor Zaroff.
A great deal. He's here, isn't he?
The food. It couldn't be anyone else but Zaroff. He led the field in producing food from the sea. His progress is astonishing.
Just send him this message, and you'll see.
You're making a big mistake!
Ara, take this message to Professor Zaroff.
Hold on! Hold on for your lives.
Don't move. Don't even breathe.
First, release my friends.
But I do. Professor Zaroff, if anything happens to them, you'll never know the secret I was going to tell you.
First, let me say how glad I am to see that the reports of your death twenty years previously are a little premature.
The East blamed the West. The West, the East.
Now here you are, the greatest scientific genius since Leonardo, under the sea. You must have a fantastic story to tell?
I haven't got one.
But I'm sure a that great man like you wouldn't want a modern scientific brain like mine to be sacrificed to a heathen idol?
Yes.
Yes.
I come with you.
Just give me a clue, Professor.
Ancient temples under the sea. But that's not possible! That's only a legend.
We're on the ancient kingdom of Atlantis.
But how did you get them to accept you? Surely science is in opposition to ancient temple ritual and idol worship?
What is it, Ara?
Fish operation? Well, well, well. Ara, do you know where the main fuses are?
Oh, never mind. Go back to Polly, and if the chance comes, get her away from there! Will you do that for me?
No, not a bit, not a bit.
I expected nothing less from the great Professor Zaroff.
I can't think of how I came to be so clumsy. I must have bumped into it.
As your prisoner?
Professor, you have offered these people a very big sugar-coated pill to make them accept you, yes?
The dreams of a people living on a drowned continent must be.
Exactly. But now, how are you going to do it? Even a genius like you.
A very large mass to lift.
Yes, may I?
Yes, but you haven't got a drain big enough to take an ocean.
You'll forgive me. I'm a little lost. The crust of the Earth is more than a hundred miles thick. Below that is believed to be a white-hot molten core. Now where is your ocean going to go?
Oh, now you're making fun of me, Professor.
Even supposing you could drill to the depth of a hundred miles.
It's still an enormous obstacle.
Even if.
But Professor?
Even supposing you succeeded, you know what will happen, don't you?
Well, the water will be converted into superheated steam, the pressure will grow, and crack the crust of the Earth. Destroy all life, maybe even blow the planet apart.
Yes.
Yes. Just one small question. Why do you want to blow up the world?
Ah, Mister Damon, you're back. Did your operation go well?
Oh dear. How very frustrating for you.
Oh, yes, yes of course you will.
It's very important to you, isn't it? I mean, you want all the human labour you can get, don't you?
Amazing. The Professor leads the field in scientific discoveries. What a fantastic conception. To control the world from a test tube.
Well, two can play at that game. Have you ever seen this?
Ara? No, wait, Ara. It's me.
Where's Polly?
Good girl, well done. Ara, where can I find your Chief of State?
I want to talk to him. Can you take me to him?
I'll have to take that risk.
(sotto) Can you get Damon away? I want to talk to the priest alone.
Can I have a word with you, Ramo?
We're both on the same side, Ramo. You distrust Zaroff out of instinct. I distrust him because I know the truth.
That's a very good question. I wish I could think of a good answer.
Can we talk here?
He says that he's going to raise Atlantis, yes? That's not quite true. He intends to destroy Atlantis.
It's easier than raising it.
He intends to drill a hole through the earth's crust, and drain away the ocean, yes?
Have you any idea what will happen if he does that? I'll show you.
May I?
This pot is the earth. This is the ocean. The ocean drains into the earth. Now, but the centre of the earth is hot, far hotter than this fire. So what happens?
This pot is Zaroff's project. Watch. Now the pot begins to boil, but the steam can't get out, and so. I think we'd better stand a little further back. Get down!
This is what will happen. Zaroff intends to raise Atlantis, but in little pieces.
Well, I thought I might mention it. Of course, if you don't mind being blown up.
Could I? I am not the ruler of Atlantis.
I might.
Could I?
How do I look?
Never mind.
Ramo, this ruler of yours, is he
A man of science.
Oh no, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you. In fact, I wanted to speak to you alone, Excellency.
Excellency, the Professor is a wonderful man.
A worker of miracles.
But, have you noticed his eyes lately?
When he talks of his project, have you noticed his eyes? They light up like this!
The Professor is as mad as a hatter.
Completely. No answer. It's sad.
So you will not listen to us?
We've only just begun.
You disappoint me, Professor. I didn't think a man of science needed the backing of thugs.
What, you mean you haven't told your own people what's in store for them? Are you afraid, Zaroff?
No. You've no quarrel with Ramo. I persuaded him to help me. I'm the one to blame.
Let's not say goodbye, Professor. We'll be seeing each other again.
What happens now?
I'm sorry I got you into this, Ramo.
(sotto) I know that voice.
(sotto) Ramo. Don't be afraid. Get up and follow me. Come on.
Oh, I thought I recognised the voice. How on Earth did you manage it?
It was the sweetest sound I've ever heard in me life.
Ben, how did you find this place?
Jamie!
Our course is plain. We must attack Zaroff. He has gone mad, and he's bent on destroying the whole world. We've only a short while in which to stop him.
Food.
Hmm?
No, I mean Zaroff and his people cannot exist without food.
Yes, but who provides it?
The fish people! Exactly. And why? Because they are slaves. But slaves, like worms, can be made to turn.
Tell them, Ramo.
Exactly. Zaroff has not yet found the answer to his great problem. All his seafood goes bad in a few hours, and has to be thrown away.
And so
What would it do for us? I don't know, really, but it's a start. Do you think you can do it?
But you are Irish.
We make this place our headquarters. If nobody's here, just leave a message.
Kidnap Professor Zaroff!
Are you all right?
You look splendid.
What's wrong with it?
That's what I'm supposed to be.
What do you expect? This is Atlantis. Now you know what to do?
Wait a minute. Something's gone wrong. Where's Zaroff?
A man?
About five foot nine?
Black coat, baggy trousers and a bow tie?
No. As a matter of fact I haven't.
Polly!
Zaroff!
Zaroff!
Splendid. He's close behind me. I hope I haven't set too hot a pace for him. No. Here he comes.
You'll see. Come on.
He's only bluffing. Nothing can start without him.
Simple. The great Zaroff would have to be there to set off the explosion. Miss your big moment? I think not.
Some sort of attack.
I don't know. We'd better make sure.
Get inside that laboratory.
No, somebody's got to stay here to look after Zaroff.
Very well. Come on. Quick.
This is likely to take some time.
I don't think so. Better duck down here.
Just a minute, I've had a thought.
Jamie, you'd better watch Zaroff.
Well, we need a guide, and only Ramo knows all the passages.
Come on. Come on.
Yes.
Zaroff's taken her as a hostage.
No, Ben. Jamie, you go after Polly. Only watch out. Zaroff's a desperate man.
Ben, you and I have other fish to fry. Come on.
It's the governor. It's Thous.
I don't know. Doesn't seem to have hit anything vital.
Neither would you with a bullet in you.
I know. Come on, we must get him to safety.
To the generating station.
Here we are. Careful. Anyone at home?
Where's Polly and Jamie?
Why?
We'll have to find them. Now, listen everyone. I have a plan.
It might even work.
Our one hope of stopping Zaroff is to flood all this lower part of Atlantis.
Yes. The temple, and Zaroff's laboratory.
Don't know. We'll have to take that chance.
They'll have to be warned and moved to a higher level. That's your job and Sean's.
Ben and I will try and get into the generating station. We'll turn up the power on the reactor, break down the sea walls and flood the laboratory. There's only one thing that's worrying me.
Can we all swim?
We'll walk past him.
Oh, you think I look a bit conspicuous, do you?
Maybe you're right. I know. You're a guard, and I'm a prisoner, right?
Now don't make a mess of it, there's a good chap.
You don't know the password either!
Very well done, Ben, very well done. I'm not quite sure about that not being normal bit, but very well done. I couldn't have done better myself.
Come on, now. We've got little time.
Cut those cables.
Oh, what a question. Of course I don't! There's no rule against trying, is there? There. Now, Zaroff's laboratory. He should be feeling the effects of this little lot any time now.
Good day to you. I hope I'm not too late.
Oh, how very nice of you, but I'm afraid I've interrupted something important, haven't I? Oh, yes, I can see that I have. You were on the point of exploding your firecracker, weren't you?
I hope you've let these gentlemen into your big secret.
Naturally. They can't help themselves, can they? They must be devoted to you, to allow you to blow them all to pieces!
Oh, have I dropped a brick? Oh, I seem to have shaken some of them. Zaroff, I think you ought to know the sea has broken through and is about to overwhelm us here.
Then perhaps the distant roaring that we can hear is just the goddess Amdo with the indigestion?
Time is running out, Zaroff. Hadn't you better call it a day?
I know. I've got to get him out of there. Come over here. I've got an idea.
All right, Ben.
I know. But it's much more exciting in the dark.
Ben, I've been thinking. I can't leave Zaroff to drown down there. I'm going back for him.
But we can't leave him there.
Zaroff. He's cut off.
Well, how do I know? All we can do is to go on going up. Come on.
Nearly there. Of course, if you will lie down and sleep.
Boo!
Me?
Us? Polly, good to see you. Come on, you two.
Right. Off we go into the wide blue yonder, as someone was once heard to remark.
You sound very happy, Jamie.
He's got a point there.
Control it? Of course I can control it.
If I wanted to. It's just that I've never wanted to.
Right, just for that, I'll show you. Now, where shall we go? I know, let's go to Mars.
Do something? I seem to have done something. It's all your fault, wanting me to tamper with the steering. I'm very sorry, everybody, but I'm afraid the Tardis is out of control!

Run.
Yep. Plastic.
Why would they be students?
Well, you said it. Why students?
That makes sense. Well done.
They're not students.
Who's Wilson?
Wilson's dead.
Hold on. Mind your eyes.
They're made of plastic. Living plastic creatures. They're being controlled by a relay device in the roof, which would be a great big problem if I didn't have this. (a small bomb) So, I'm going to go up there and blow them up, and I might well die in the process, but don't worry about me. No, you go home. Go on. Go and have your lovely beans on toast. Don't tell anyone about this, because if you do, you'll get them killed.
I'm the Doctor, by the way. What's your name?
Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life!
What're you doing here?
Well, what do you do that for?
I must have got the wrong signal. You're not plastic, are you? No, bonehead. Bye, then.
Oh, we're talking millions.
Yes, you are.
Yes, there is.
No.
Might as well, thanks. Just milk.
That won't last, he's gay and she's an alien.
Hmm. Sad ending.
Rose Tyler.
Ah, could've been worse. Look at the ears.
Luck be a lady.
Maybe not.
What's that, then? You got a cat?
It's all right, I've stopped it. There you go, you see? Armless.
Ow!
Yes I can. Here I am. This is me, swanning off. See you.
Ten out of ten for observation.
No, I don't.
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Doesn't work.
Told you. The Doctor.
Just the Doctor.
Hello!
Sort of.
No, I was just passing through. I'm a long way from home.
Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you. You were just an accident. You got in the way, that's all.
It was after me, not you. Last night, in the shop, I was there, you blundered in, almost ruined the whole thing. This morning, I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down. The only reason it fixed on you is 'cos you've met me.
Sort of, yeah.
Sort of, yeah.
No one.
Well, who else is there? I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, go to bed, and watch telly, while all the time, underneath you, there's a war going on.
The thing controlling it projects life into the arm. I cut off the signal, dead.
Thought control. Are you all right?
Long story.
No.
It's not a price war. They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you. Do you believe me?
But you're still listening.
Do you know like we were saying about the Earth revolving? It's like when you were a kid. The first time they tell you the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it because everything looks like it's standing still. I can feel it. The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour, and the entire planet is hurtling round the sun at sixty seven thousand miles an hour, and I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go. That's who I am. Now, forget me, Rose Tyler. Go home.
Don't mind me. I'm just toasting the happy couple. On the house!
Sonic screwdriver.
Nah. Tell you what, let's go in here.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door, and believe me, they've tried. Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but the head's perfect. I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source. Right. Where do you want to start?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes. Is that all right?
It's called the Tardis, this thing. T A R D I S. That's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us.
Oh. I didn't think of that.
Melt?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Following the signal. It's fading. Wait a minute, I've got it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Almost there. Almost there. Here we go!
I lost the signal, I got so close.
Disappears there and reappears here. You wouldn't understand.
It melted with the head. Are you going to witter on all night?
Look, if I did forget some kid called Mickey
It's because I'm trying to save the life of every stupid ape blundering on top of this planet, all right?
Yes, it is!
Lots of planets have a north.
It's a telephone box from the 1950s. It's a disguise.
Nothing. It loves you. You've got such a good planet. Lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins in the air, perfect. Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs. It's food stock was destroyed in the war, all its protein plants rotted, so Earth, dinner!
Anti-plastic.
Anti-plastic. But first I've got to find it. How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
The transmitter. The Consciousness is controlling every single piece of plastic, so it needs a transmitter to boost the signal.
Like a transmitter. Round and massive, slap bang in the middle of London.
A huge circular metal structure like a dish, like a wheel. Radial. Close to where we're standing. Must be completely invisible. What? What?
What? What is it? What?
Oh. Fantastic!
Think of it, plastic all over the world, every artificial thing waiting to come alive. The shop window dummies, the phones, the wires, the cables
Still, we've found the transmitter. The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness. That's it, inside the vat. A living plastic creature.
I'm not here to kill it. I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you. If I might have permission to approach?
Yeah, that was always a possibility. Keep him alive to maintain the copy.
Can we keep the domestics outside, thank you?
Am I addressing the Consciousness? Thank you. If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp shunt technology. So, may I suggest, with the greatest respect, that you shunt off?
Oh, don't give me that. It's an invasion, plain and simple. Don't talk about constitutional rights. I am talking! This planet is just starting. These stupid little people have only just learnt how to walk, but they're capable of so much more. I'm asking you on their behalf. Please, just go.
That was just insurance. I wasn't going to use it. I was not attacking you. I'm here to help. I'm not your enemy. I swear, I'm not. What do you mean?
No. Oh, no. Honestly, no. Yes, that's my ship. That's not true. I should know, I was there. I fought in the war. It wasn't my fault. I couldn't save your world! I couldn't save any of them!
It's the Tardis! The Nestene's identified its superior technology. It's terrified. It's going to the final phase. It's starting the invasion! Get out, Rose! Just leg it now!
It's the activation signal. It's transmitting!
Get out, Rose! Just get out! Run!
No!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble.
Nestene Consciousness? Easy.
Yes, I would. Thank you. Right then, I'll be off, unless, er, I don't know, you could come with me. This box isn't just a London hopper, you know. It goes anywhere in the universe free of charge.
He's not invited. What do you think? You could stay here, fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go anywhere.
Yeah.
Okay. See you around.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?

Yes, the old home universe. It's many times larger than anything you're used to.
Yes.
Well, just the interesting ones.
Well, law of probability, that sort of thing, you know. Anyway, we're supposed to be on our way back to Gallifrey.
No. What? Adric, I give you a privileged insight into the mystery of time, yes?
Open your mind to adventures beyond imagining, yes?
And you criticise my logic.
Ah. Ah. Oh, you've noticed that, have you? Well, I mean, anyone can talk sense. As long as that's understood, you and I are going to get on splendidly.
Metulla Orionsis, I'd say. Does that make sense?
Yes, that's an interesting planetary system.
Eh? You're beginning to get the hang of this console. Yes, Traken. (reads) Traken Union, famous for its universal harmony. A whole empire held together by
Well, by people just being terribly nice to each other.
Yes. I don't think I've actually been there. Just know it by repute, so I'll tell you all about it sometime.
Going to Traken? Who said so?
You set them.
But I didn't. Did I? I wonder what the law of probability would say about that?
Now, what seems to be the problem?
I thought so.
I thought you might appreciate it if I gave you the impression I knew what was happening. We could panic, of course, but where would that get us?
I don't know.
Adric.
Adric. If I knew everything that was going to happen, where would the fun be?
Hello.
It's all right, Adric. The Keeper of Traken.
Oh, well, it wasn't difficult to guess who'd taken possession of the Tardis. I mean, there can't be many people in the universe with the capacity of just dropping in like this.
Shush. Time reveals everything, Adric. What can we do for you, Keeper?
Yes, yes, I know that feeling.
Oh, come on. It's still fairly impressive. I mean, I couldn't flit around the universe in an old chair like this.
Right!
How so, Keeper?
Shush.
Oh, he's not local.
E-space, wasn't it? Where's he gone?
Yes. They say the atmosphere there was so full of goodness that evil just shrivelled up and died. Maybe that's why I never went there.
Oh please, Keeper, please.
Melkur?
So what becomes of this Melkur?
Well, that particular evil seems to be well under control.
Sense what, Keeper?
Anything I can do, Keeper.
Shush. Well, we'll see. We'll see.
Yes, isn't it. What do you make of it?
So do I. We?
Knowledge. Accumulated wisdom of centuries.
Well, they're just a couple of my old time logs. You know, I really may have been to Traken. It's so difficult to keep track of.
Oh, yes. Mind you, I don't bother now. Much too busy. Actually, this might not be the right volume. Here, take that and make yourself useful.
Well, you know, Traken, Keepers, all-pervading evil.
Yeah, anything along those lines.
Ha, ha. Interesting stuff, isn't it?
What?
And?
So?
Ah, yes. Well, I suppose it is a bit above your head. Mind you, they did say I had a very sophisticated prose style.
Handwriting? What about my handwriting?
We've arrived. Right, now let's see what this place really looks like.
Well, it's a good place if you fancy a spot of gardening.
Hmm? Looks pretty well calcified to me.
Fiddlesticks.
Put your hands up in the air like that.
I wonder what we've done this time? Are you the welcoming committee?
I wondered when you were going to ask. You know, I hate to say this sort of thing, but Traken hospitality isn't what it used to be.
It's probably the usual misunderstanding. We keep running into this sort of thing. Actually, we were invited here this time.
Yes, to pitch in, help out, that sort of thing.
Well, excuse my name dropping, but the Keeper, actually.
In a manner of speaking, yes.
Well, unless he's in the habit of soliciting help, yes.
Yes.
Yes. We thought we'd walk the rest of the way. You know, fresh air, stretch the legs.
Yes.
Look, why don't we summon up the Keeper or something?
Sorry to trouble you, Keeper, but we do seem to have a problem here.
Please tell them who we are, will you?
Keeper, tell us.
Consuls, you're making a big mistake. I'm sure you're all charming, reasonable people at heart.
The least you can do is hear what we have to say.
Quite! And Adric and I are willing to stamp with the best of them, but let's stamp with some justice and precision. Consuls, you saw what happened. Your Keeper was attacked.
Yes. Someone here, or someone very near here.
Did she say Melkur?
A force was certainly brought to bear upon the Keeper from some quarter. Tell me more about this Melkur.
No, not at all. A high energy beam. And if I had the right instrument
Extraordinary. It's just the thing. How very curious.
Yes, and so I see are you. Tremas, isn't it? Been investigating high energy forcefields, eh?
Well, I've dabbled a bit in the bioelectronics line. May I cast an eye over that?
Where did you get these readings?
Plasma fields of this strength couldn't have been generated without some pretty formidable magnetic containment. I'm hardly tooled up for that sort of thing.
Consequences?
Ah yes, yes, very civil of you, Consul. And we'll do our very best to try and return the compliment, won't we, Adric?
A sort of house arrest? Well, that suits us, eh, Adric?
It's been here again.
Whatever it was that was here last time.
Those stones have been hit by a plasma beam. They're disintegrated. Look, the sun's coming up. You're right, it is morning. Tremas, you know what I need more than anything else in the universe?
Breakfast. Is your place far?
Well, if you don't mind, I think it's high time we got down to work.
Well, the first thing we ought to do is find my Tardis.
Hello.
Oh, fine, fine. It's always nice to be reprieved. Listen, you didn't notice a tall blue box with a lamp on top out there, did you?
I know that Tardis, Tremas. It's got to be out there somewhere.
Thank you.
Is something the matter?
Huh, that's hardly likely.
Well, I can see the force of that argument, but what I'm more interested in is finding my
Really?
Citizen trouble there?
Wait.
There's someone in there.
Don't. She's in some sort of trance.
Yes, from the Melkur thing.
You know, Tremas, your Source manipulator is really quite beautiful.
Its limitless organising capacity refined to a single frame and obedient to the will of your Keeper. A great achievement, Tremas, and a great temptation to people less principled than ourselves.
Bothers you, does he, Tremas?
Yes, me too. I'd like to take another look, but first, the Tardis.
Now, we put it down about, yes, here. Hmm.
It's here. It's just been displaced slightly by the current time cone. Now, what's the simplest way around this? I'd like to set up a standing wave. Something the autosystems can home in on.
Well, it'll be a start.
Psst.
I thought I told you to stay with Nyssa.
Shush. Can't it wait?
All right. Come on, through here.
The Doctor thinks you might have a very good point. This certainly looks like a Tardis generator, but you don't get shift ratios of this magnitude in an ordinary Type Forty. Adric, we have a full backflow inducer in the making here.
There we are, a fully fledged full backflow inducer.
Yes?
What does that mean?
Quick, the vault. The vault.
You're forgetting about the Tardis, Adric. Come on, come on.
Wait, wait, wait.
Well, give it a moment or two. Trust me.
If you come up with a better idea, let me know.
So you're the cause of all this.
Adric, Tremas, don't look at its eyes.
He should be all right. Come on, he's only stunned.
Well, quite a little home from home.
Not till we came along, that is.
Some sort of electron lock. Still, sonic screwdriver should do it.
Seems a bit far along. Be a good chap, will you, and nip outside and unlock it for me. I'm not a magician, you know.
Lovely day.
The Keeper's not dead yet, so we still have a little time.
Whatever happens, Melkur must not be allowed to make contact with the Source.
Exactly.
Lovely day. Huh. They're not a very talkative lot, your Fosters, Tremas.
Why? Why should she, anyway? Ah, a friendly face.
Nyssa. Nyssa, the lock.
Ah.
New technology dates so quickly these days.
Which way, Nyssa? This way or that?
Right.
What? I must remember never to fall out with your daughter, Tremas. May I look at that? Yes, very clever. No self-respecting fugitive should be without one.
Now.
Back to the Tardis. Much the safest place if we can get there.
It's the only way in. Just stay calm, eh? I'll think of something.
Come on, back.
Come on.
Ah, good morning, or afternoon, or is it evening? It's very difficult to keep track of time around here.
Ah.
Oh yes.
Tremas, we've got to get out of these corridors and lie low somewhere.
Good thinking, Adric. Come on, Tremas, lead on.
Well, the new regime seems to be making rather a mess of things. Tremas. Tremas.
Blueprints. Master plans. Do you happen to keep them here?
Well, the master plans to the Source manipulator, of course.
Tremas, we must stop Kassia becoming the Keeper, and for that we need the master plans.
Well of course you swore an oath! Now you have to choose. Your personal honour against the safety of the whole of Traken.
Well, that's fine. That's fine, Tremas. I mean, when this thing has taken over the entire Source you'll have the consolation of knowing that you kept your honour intact.
Good.
Now, Nyssa, you stand on guard. It's magnificent. Magnificent. It's a pity about that poor chap having to sit for thousands of years in a chair, but it is magnificent.
Yes, I can see there's something in that. Adric, put your mind to that.
Agreed, yes. I wonder, could it be tripped?
Oh, dangerous thoughts, Tremas. Dangerous thoughts. Look, Adric. Warp crossover connected there, shutdown element there and
Well, only if the servo blew.
Well, it could be done. Tricky, and I hope not necessary. Yes. Thank you, Tremas. Put that away safely, will you? Nyssa, how are the fun and games over there?
Good. Let's get back to the Tardis. Off you go. Come on. Off you go.
Well?
Neither do I. Still, what can't be cured must be endured.
Yes, yes, don't listen to me. I never do. Come on. Come on.
No, it is very quiet. Wait, wait. Come on, quickly.
Now remember, we come to the statue presently. No funny business. Off you go.
What is it?
What? Imagination. Come on.
Well, Neman. Neman, you've made a splendid recovery.
Well, clarity is the soul of knowing what the other chap's going to do. What are you going to do?
What?
Yes, and Kassia will be the next Keeper unless we make the Sanctum.
Come on.
Oh yes, yes, we're still here. Don't write us off yet, will you.
Oh, no. We know what you're up to, Melkur, and we'll stop you. That's a promise.
Consul, don't do it!
Consul Kassia has betrayed you all. Don't complete the transition.
Don't listen to her, Consul.
(to Adric) It's our only chance. Secure the Tardis. Take Nyssa with you and wait.
It's too late, Tremas. Far too late.
Your new Keeper.
Well, I know it's not exactly what you had in mind, but now I'm afraid you're rather stuck with him.
I should do it, Consul, if I were you. He'll make you.
Huh. No compulsion? You've changed your tune.
My only ambition is to stop you, Melkur.
(sotto) I want to get a closer look at that Melkur creature. I have the oddest feeling we've met somewhere before.
If you ask me, poor old Kassia didn't have much say in the matter.
He'll destroy you too, Neman, just as he destroyed Kassia.
Shush.
Looks like the second law of thermodynamics.
Talking of entropy, what happened last night in the sanctum, the statue fading and struggling, that was most unexpected.
A C-reaction. Melkur all sweetness and reason because he's vulnerable.
Well then, perhaps we could apply the ultimate sanction.
What, even though we've got the master plans of the Source Manipulator?
Which in our case we have not got. What's that piece of mechanism? Oh, of course, a recursive integrator. Hmm. How are the rings encoded?
I see. Then there'll be a single large prime number at the root of it and we don't have the integer key. What a pity you still haven't got your own ring.
Oh, I don't know. I know one or two shortcuts.
Come in.
Ah, Neman. How nice.
Dear me, he seems to be almost back on form.
All right, all right, Melkur. There's no need to show off your powers as Keeper. We know what you can do.
Tremas, why don't you do as he asks? It's only a bit of paper, after all. You know why he wants it. He doesn't want you to show it to me.
Afraid I might spoil your fun?
I'd watch it if I were you, Melkur. Burning the candle at both ends and all that.
Oh, by the way, by the way, Neman. Neman, come here. You chaps might be interested in this as well.
Listen, do you know that expression, two heads are better than one?
Well, I think that one head's better than three.
So far it's going magnificently. Melkur'll be out of action for a while. Let's try and make that a permanent arrangement, shall we? Come on.
Come on, through here. Come on.
Yes.
How much longer do we have, Tremas?
Not a very pleasant thought. I had considered a more drastic solution.
No. Just an idea that Adric and I had.
Eight, eight, seven, one, zero. Another zero. That's a bad sign.
Down, Tremas.
What?
No. Three more digits to go.
Shush. We've still got a chance. Just remember three, three, seven.
That's a very popular delusion.
Old scores?
All this and that too? How do you propose to manage that?
Of course, the Master.
I used to know an ancient remedy for mad dogs. I must look it up some time. Good library here, have you?
I thought you meant to destroy me.
Then that is the end for a Time Lord.
Adric! Three, three, seven!
Three, three, seven!
Why, thank you, Adric. That should cancel out your little bit of sabotage and put paid to the resident Keeper for good.
You know, I was going to mention that. I think that one of you two should step into the breach if you want to keep this quaint old custom going.
You just missed your chance of becoming Keeper yet again. But confidentially, I think that you're very lucky.
Really?
Ah, well, I'm afraid your luck's just run out. Adric and I have got to fly. Come on, Adric.
Well, she seems to be going right as ninepence now.
Oh, probably the Master up to one of his little party tricks again. Then the general run-down condition. It badly needs an overhaul.
Well, it involves an awful lot of recalculation, and this type's not really my forte.
Oh, guesswork mostly.
Yes, it did, didn't it. Adric, wouldn't it be nice to be right about everything?

We're approaching a planet.
We shall soon see.
What's the matter, my dear?
Oh, something overheating here. Just as well we're landing. Susan, check the fault locator, please.
Oh, no, no, of course not. It's just, well, there we were, in the late eighteenth century and I tried another frequency to side-step the ship back into the middle of the twentieth century.
What's happening? (frantically flipping switches) Close the doors, please. We haven't materialised properly. Quickly!
Don't argue, dear boy. It's an emergency! Close the doors!
We're just landing.
What?
Oh, please don't bother me.
Susan, go back to the fault locator and I want you to check everything, child. Do you understand? Everything!
Oh, don't be childish. They opened. The doors opened before we properly materialised.
What?
Oh, don't go on with these futile questions, please. Can't you understand? Can't you see?
We were just about to materialise, when the doors opened and we hadn't properly adjusted.
No, that's impossible.
Oh please, don't keep talking on the twentieth century level. I'm talking about time travel. Neither of you can understand what I'm talking about, I can see that.
My dear boy, I
There must be something wrong, Susan. I shall have to check that fault locator myself to make sure. Excuse me.
Well, happily no harm's been done. It's most puzzling. Oh, my dear Barbara, was I rude to you just now? If so I'm so sorry. I always forget the niceties under pressure. Please forgive me.
Thank you. Well, I suppose everything's all right and you see the temperature there. It's quite safe to go outside. Oh, Susan, just turn on the scanner and let's try and see where we are.
Did you notice the way it blew out?
Like something too big for it's frame.
But yet I don't know, that can't be right.
Oh, no, no, no, dear boy. No, it's most puzzling of course, but now we don't know what's behind those doors.
Yes. I wonder why the? Well, we must see.
Yes, please, Susan. But all of you, cautiously, please.
The space pressure was far too great whilst we were materialising. The strange thing is that we all came out of it unscathed. It's most puzzling. It's a big mystery, my boy. Come along.
Now why wouldn't the scanner show us all this, hmm?
Yes, I suppose so. It could be. What a strange rock formation.
Chesterton, here, come here. Look here, is that cement?
Rather a rough kind, isn't it?
Yes. It's manufactured, anyway, to hold the stone in place. You know, to fix it firmly beneath.
Yes, it's all most odd, isn't it. Most odd. Now, Barbara, I suggest that you and I take that path and Susan and you, sir, go that way.
Yes, yes.
What? A snake?
Wait, wait, wait. Yes, I think it's dead.
No eyes, no head. you see. The skin's interesting, isn't it.
Yes, it's a down, you see.
Oh, no, no, no, it's quite dead. No, no. Death, you see, has it's own particular posture and appearance. Yes, yes. Let's go a bit further.
Well, here we are then. This is the tail end of it, and I know what it is. It's a huge earthworm.
Yes, there are no earthworms this size on your planet.
You know, except for its size, I could swear that it came from your world. Well, let's go on. Come along.
Oh, no, we won't, no, and I'm determined not to go back until we discover something more definite. At the moment we only have one phenomenon and this mystery.
Well, all this maze you're talking about. You know, I admit it's a bit haphazard, but it seems to have some kind of pattern about it. And this pattern suggests to me that there's a brain with a purpose behind it all. Come along.
Well now, this is interesting. This has been cut by a manufacturer. Look out!
Are you all right?
That was a near miss. It would have given you a nasty headache.
You can see quite clearly what this is. It's a matchstick.
No, it doesn't just look like one, it is a matchstick.
Don't you see? That huge earthworm, and now this? Can't you see what's happened, hmm?
We have been reduced roughly to the size of an inch.
You, me, all of us and the ship.
We must get hold of the others quickly and return to the Tardis.
What's happened?
Well someone picked it up, I suppose.
No, no, now, please, no. Let me do it. You might hurt yourself. You just let me, hmm.
Yes, yes.
I'm all right. Yes, well it looks a tremendous distance to me. There's a house over there, and there's a man sitting down, reading something. It's a notebook, I think.
How do I know?
Yes, I suppose so. Watch what you're doing, will you?
Gently, gently, gently. We've got to find Chesterton.
Courage, my dear. I know all this is a bit of a nightmare, but we've just got to get Ian back and then we can go back to the ship.
Of course, yes, I'll try. There's always a chance. But first things first. We must find Chesterton. We can't go back that way. We must go back the same way that we came.
It's not moving.
It's perfectly stiff.
Ha! What an awe-inspiring sight. Now what chance would human beings have, I really wonder, in the world of creatures like this bee, hmm?
Take a closer look.
It's the same distinctive aroma.
I wonder what it is that could kill off nature like this.
Well, we must presume that it can. So no eating or drinking until we've done our very best to find Ian, hmm?
Sounded more like an ancient cannon.
Well, we're progressing nicely.
Yes. Rather wide-spread, I'm afraid.
Yes, I wonder. I wonder.
What's that smell? Cordite? Gunpowder, hmm?
You weren't with us, Chesterton, but every insect we came across is dead.
Yes, and we don't know what it was that killed them. That man, he's been shot, murdered.
Quite so. Both are vital to the growth of things. However, we must leave this simple mystery and get back to the ship. As I said, my dear, it's fortunate for all of us that everything is dead.
And whatever you do, don't look into the cat's eyes. Close your own if you want to.
Don't relax. One swipe of its paw would smash us to pieces.
Well, we can't get back to the ship just yet, and you know how fast cats can move. And another thing, we could be mistaken for mice and I don't fancy being part of the cat's diet.
No, I'm afraid not.
It's out of the question, my dear. How can we possibly communicate with them?
Yes, and I would add another and more important factor. The people who live in this house are murderers. Or one of them is. Therefore we can't expect sympathy and understanding from an insane or a criminal mind.
Well, what can we do, my dear? I mean, surely this is the question. Normally I wouldn't hesitate, but the destruction of the life force is frightful. There it is. I mean, what can we do as we are?
Well, shall we proceed?
Oh, they're all right, they're all right. It's a pity they didn't come this way, though.
No, no, it's dangerous. Let's go over to that pipe there.
They've gone.
Are you sure you saw one of them pick up the briefcase and go into that building behind us?
Phew. Awful smell of chemical in there. (the downspout)
No. I wonder if that pipe extends into the room where that briefcase went.
Yes, yes, of course, my dear. There's no other way. If you go in there you'll see it's all corroded, so there's plenty of hand and foot holds. That chemical smell means that it's germ-free.
Well, if it is, I shall have to give up, and I'm not going to give up before I've tried. And remember, you must think of the other two. They must be constantly reminding themselves they're only one inch high. There's only the two of us to help them.
Yes, yes, yes, go on.
Yes, I'm all right, my dear. I can manage very well.
Good. Well, onwards and upwards, my dear, eh?
(breathless) Yes, I'm all right. I'm coming, my child. I'm coming.
Yes, I know. Just leave me for a minute. I shall be all right in a little while.
Oh, the smell of that chemical very nearly overpowered me.
Well, come to think of it, our voices sound rather odd. It's this sink, of course. It's all working like an echo chamber.
I don't know, child. I don't know.
You mustn't expect to hear their voices reply, my dear. This sink acts as a sound box. It's increasing the volume of your voice.
I don't know, I don't know, Susan.
No, no, Susan. No, our voices are much too high. It's a different frequency altogether, my child. Dog might be able to, perhaps, but, well, try it again.
What uncanny good luck.
Yes, I know, my dear. I know.
Good, he's started. Now the sooner we get out of here the better.
Oh, it's a sure way back down to the garden, I do know that.
Listen. There's someone in the room! Someone's come back into that room.
Quick, down the sink again.
Yes, come along.
Quickly, Susan, into the overflow pipe.
They've put the plug back in again.
Yes, but if they fill that sink with any more water.
Exactly.
There you are, you see, my friends, you can't get rid of us as easy as all that.
Perhaps.
Well I think we should take a closer look at this oversized document. The more we know about the enemy the better.
Yes, you're quite right, my boy. I only wish I could see it more as a whole.
Let me have the notebook, child. Now, we shall have to make a map of this. Now, Chesterton, you start marking off a section with your feet, will you?
And Susan and Barbara, I want you to call out to me what you see written beneath you.
Yes, yes. This is the insecticide quite clearly. It's a bit rough, of course, but it tells us the story.
This indicates the amount of organic esters.
My dear boy, this formula's quite clear, look, with one vital difference. The inventor has made the insecticide everlasting.
Well, given in sufficient quantity, of course, it's capable of killing human beings.
Yes, or even coming in contact with it.
Now, now, my dear. Gently, gently.
Yes, now there's another point to consider, my dear boy. Eating. We can't, even if we do find food here.
We can go back to the sink, of course. The water in the tap is quite safe.
Ah, but I want to go into that direction. You see, there's something over there that might be the solution to all this business.
A telephone, my dear.
Yes. The thing is, my boy, how heavy is that receiver?
Very well.
Oh, er, oh, Barbara, would you mind bringing another one of these, please?
Got it?
Ah, thank you, my dear. You look very tired.
Well, we can manage. You just sit down and rest for a while, hmm?
You think that we three can manage, eh?
Well, I don't think Barbara's quite up to it.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Quickly.
Yes, I'm afraid we have and it's my fault. I thought it was worth trying.
There. The same aroma. Insecticide. You didn't eat or drink anything?
She's got insecticide on her hands. She touched it.
Where were you then?
Yes, you see, she got it on her hands. She rubbed it off on your handkerchief.
Yes. You've got some of it on your hands and you didn't tell us anything about it. It was very wrong of you, wasn't it.
No, no, no, no, this little attack you've experienced is only temporary.
Well, it's urgent that we get her back to her normal size, but at the moment her protective cells are too small to cope with the molecules of poison in her bloodstream. But if we can, that dosage of insecticide will be seventy time less dangerous. Practically nothing at all.
Yes, oh, quite sure. We must get her back to the ship.
Oh, yes, of course I can, dear boy. Yes. Of course I can. (but he doesn't look so sure) I hope.
There's nothing I can say, dear boy. Barbara's quite right.
Yes, that's it. We'll cause trouble. Start a fire, my boy.
Well, we can try, anyway. There's nothing like a good fire, is there? IAN: What do you think, Barbara?
Come on, all together.
It's coming.
Yes, I think that's got it in about the right angle, the gas jet.
Oh, no, no, I've had a good look at this. This is pressurised. It's a spray can. Our problem will be to get away far enough when it explodes.
Oh, yes, it's going to explode and when it does it'll go off just like, well, to us a thousand pound bomb.
No, no, no, dear boy. Try hitting the box at a sharper angle. More force, more vim, hmm?
Come on, let's light the gas jet. Turn it on.
Shan't be long now.
Yes, very well, and what infernal machines those Zeppelins were.
It's worked! It's worked! Come on, all of you. Back to the ship. Susan, take care of Barbara. Quickly, quickly.
Yes, I know it is. I know all about it.
You'll be surprised. Go on, lead on.
Got to repeat exactly the things that happened to us when we landed.
Yes. That seed over there, by the chair. Take it over to that table so that we can all see it. Wrap that round it when you do it.
Shh. I think it's working. Yes. Ha ha! I think it's working, my boy.
Yes! Yes! We've done it! Yes! We've done it!
No, no, my dear boy. No. Look, you see? It hasn't vanished at all.
Well, well, here we are then. The patient is beginning to look her usual self again.
Not at all, my dear boy. Always at your service.
Well, I'm happy to say our plan worked. We didn't have to fire the laboratory, but we did attract attention. Do you know, a policeman came into that room just as I was about to climb down that pipe.
Yes. There's your answer, my dear.
The same seed.
Completely, my dear. Now, before I get up and see where we are, I suggest you all go and have a good scrub, hmm? Off you go.
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Now is that irritating. I had to repair that wretched thing and now look at it, I can't see a thing. Wait a moment. I think we're beginning to materialise. Perhaps I shall know now where we are.

Draught.
Fancy a week in ancient Mesopotamia followed by future Mars?
On the Moon.
How's the new job? Teach anything good?
Not a thing.
Whoa, whoa. We're taking off, but the engines aren't going.
No kidding.
Next time, would it kill you to knock?
Whoa! I'm just going to pop you on hold.
Why am I saluting?
Kate Lethbridge Stewart, a word to the wise. As I'm sure your father would have told you, I don't like being picked up.
(to Osgood) Nice scarf.
Unified Intelligence Task Force.
This lot. UNIT. They investigate alien stuff. Anything alien.
I work for them.
Why shouldn't I have a job? I'd be brilliant at having a job.
I do. This is my job. I'm doing it now.
I do. I do.
No more.
I know the title.
This painting doesn't belong here, not in this time or place.
It's the fall of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city.
Time Lord art. Bigger on the inside. A slice of real time, frozen.
He was there.
Me. The other me. The one I don't talk about.
I've had many faces, many lives. I don't admit to all of them. There's one life I've tried very hard to forget. He was the Doctor who fought in the Time War, and that was the day he did it. The day I did it. The day he killed them all. The last day of the Time War. The war to end all wars between my people and the Daleks. And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other, a man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me.
What happened?
A long time ago.
Allons-y! There you go, your Majesty, what did I tell you? Bigger on the inside.
You have a picnic to eat.
Well, I'm helping you eat the picnic.
Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe. But it wasn't this face. But never mind that, your Majesty. Up on your feet. Up, up.
I'm not English. Elizabeth, will you marry me?
Ah, gotcha!
One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my marriage proposal. Two, the real Elizabeth would notice when I just casually mentioned having a different face. But then the real Elizabeth isn't a shape-shifting alien from outer space. And
Ding.
It's a machine that goes ding. Made it myself. Lights up in the presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooo. Also it can microwave frozen dinners from up to twenty feet and download comics from the future. I never know when to stop.
I'm not your love, and yes you do. You're a Zygon.
Oh, stop it. It's over. A Zygon, yes. Big red rubbery thing covered in suckers. Surprisingly good kisser. Think the real Queen of England would just decide to share her throne with any old handsome bloke in a tight suit, just cos he's got amazing hair and a nice horse? Oh.
It was the horse. I'm going to be King. Run!
We're being attacked by a shape-shifting alien from outer space, formerly disguised as my horse.
It means we're going to need a new horse.
I'll hold it off. You run. Your people need you.
Oh, good work, Doctor. Nice one. The Virgin Queen? So much for history.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, very clever.
Whatever you've got planned, forget it. I'm the Doctor. I'm nine hundred and four years old. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous. I am the Oncoming Storm, the Bringer of Darkness, and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you? Okay, carry on. Just a general warning.
Elizabeth!
That's what I'm trying to find out. Probably just your planet.
It's not working.
Back, both of you, now! That's a time fissure. A tear in the fabric of reality. Anything could happen.
10: For instance, a fez.
Stone dust.
In twelve hundred years I've never stepped in anything that wasn't.
Oi, you. Are you sciency?
Got a name?
Good. I've always wanted to meet someone called Yes. Now, I want this stone dust analysed. And I want a report in triplicate, with lots of graphs and diagrams and complicated sums on my desk, tomorrow morning, ASAP, pronto, L O L. See? Job. Do I have a desk?
And I want a desk.
Never gonna happen.
Interesting.
No, where it's broken from. Look at the shatter pattern. The glass on all these paintings has been broken from the inside.
So?
Lots of somethings. Dangerous.
Oh no, not now.
No, not now. I'm busy.
No, no. This is different. I remember this. Almost remember. Oh, of course. This is where I come in.
Geronimo!
Oof!
That's just what I was wondering.
Oh, that is skinny. That is proper skinny. I've never seen it from the outside. It's like a special effect. Oi!
Ha! Matchstick man.
You're not.
Compensating.
For what?
Regeneration. It's a lottery.
Oh, he's cool. Isn't he cool? I'm the Doctor and I'm all cool. Oops, I'm wearing sandshoes.
What are you doing here? I'm busy.
Oh, busy. I see. Is that what we're calling it, eh? Eh?
Hello, ladies.
Don't start.
Listen, what you get up to in the privacy of your own regeneration is your business.
One of them is a Zygon.
Urgh. I'm not judging you.
Your Majesties. Probably a good time to run.
Elizabeth, whichever one of you is the real one, turn and run in the opposite direction to the other one.
Thanks. Lovely.
Well, won't that be nice?
One of those was a Zygon.
Yeah.
Big red rubbery thing covered in suckers.
Yeah.
Venom sacs in the tongue.
Yeah, I'm getting the point, thank you.
Nice.
Ah, hello, Clara. Can you hear me?
Where are we?
England, 1562.
Myself.
Physical passage may not be possible in both directions. Its. Ah! Hang on. Fez incoming!
So where did it go?
Okay, you used to be me, you've done all this before. What happens next?
I don't remember.
How can you forget this?
Hey, hang on. It's not my fault. You're obviously not paying enough attention. Reverse the polarity!
It's not working.
We're both reversing the polarity.
Yes, I know that.
There's two of us. I'm reversing it, you're reversing it back again. We're confusing the polarity.
You. How can you be here? More to the point, why are you here?
Well, you've certainly come to the right place.
His companions?
Yeah.
Really.
Yep.
Yes!
Still, loving the posh gravelly thing. It's very convincing.
Brave words, Dick van Dyke.
Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, that is witchcraft. Yes, yes, yes. Witchy witchcraft. Hello? Hello in there. Excuse me. Hello!
Am I talking to the wicked witch of the well?
Clara?
Clara, hi, hello. Hello. Would you mind telling these prattling mortals to get themselves begone?
Yes, tiny bit more colour.
Ooo, frogs. Nice. You heard her.
It's a timey-wimey thing.
I've no idea where he picks that stuff up.
Which one are you? What happened to the other one?
That is not the Queen of England, that's an alien duplicate.
And you can take it from him, cos he's really checked.
Oh, shut up.
Venom sacs in the tongue.
Seriously, stop it.
No, hang on. The Tower.
Did you say the Tower? Ah, yes, brilliant. Love the Tower.
Breakfast at eight, please. Will there be Wi-Fi?
Yes. No. I demand to be incarcerated in the Tower immediately with my co-conspirators Sandshoes and Granddad.
They're not sandshoes.
Three of us in one cell? That's going to cause some nasty anomalies if we don't get out soon.
What are you doing?
Getting us out.
The sonic won't work on that, it's too primitive.
Shall we ask for a better quality of door so we can escape?
Okay, so the Queen of England is now a Zygon. But never mind that. Why are we all together? Why are we all here? Well, me and Chinny, we were surprised, but you came looking for us. You knew it was going to happen. Who told you?
Oi, Chinny?
Yeah, you do have a chin.
We'd have to calculate the exact harmonic resonance of the entire structure down to a sub-atomic level. Even the sonic would take years.
It must be really recent for you.
The Time War. The last day. The day you killed them all.
The day we killed them all.
Same thing.
You're not talking about it. There's no one else here.
Count what?
I have absolutely no idea.
Ah, I don't know. I lose track. Twelve hundred and something, I think, unless I'm lying. I can't remember if I'm lying about my age, that's how old I am.
Tell me, what would be the point?
Two point four seven billion.
You forgot? Four hundred years, is that all it takes?
I moved on.
Where? Where can you be now that you can forget something like that?
Spoilers.
No. No, no, no. For once I would like to know where I'm going.
No, you really wouldn't.
No?
Is something funny? Did I miss a funny thing?
Sorry. It just occured to me. This is what I'm like when I'm alone.
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
So.
Yeah, still going.
Calculation complete.
Hey, four hundred years in four seconds. We may have had our differences, which is frankly odd in the circumstances, but, I tell you what, boys. We are incredibly clever.
How did you do that?
Right.
Yes. You've met them before. Don't you remember?
Thanks.
Yes. Exactly. Why wasn't it locked?
Suspended animation. Oh, that's very good. The Zygons all pop inside the pictures, wait a few centuries till the planet's a bit more interesting, and then out they come.
You see, Clara, they're stored in the paintings in the Under Gallery, like cup-a-soups. Except you add time, if you can picture that. Nobody could picture that. Forget I said cup-a-soups.
Exactly.
And do you know why I know that you're a fake? Because you're such a bad copy. It's not just the smell, or the unconvincing hair, or the atrocious teeth, or the eyes just a bit too close together, or the breath that could stun a horse. It's because my Elizabeth, the real Elizabeth, would never be stupid enough to reveal her own plan. Honestly, why would you do that?
Okay. So, backtracking a moment just to lend context to my earlier remarks.
Well, I'm going to need my Tardis.
Ah.
It does start to happen, yeah.
I will be right back.
Right then, back to the future.
Ah, it's his grunge phase. He grows out of it.
Don't you listen to them.
Ow! The desktop is glitching.
Hey, look. The round things.
I love the round things.
What are the round things?
No idea.
Oh dear, the friction contrafibulator. Ha! There, stabilised.
(channelling Doctor 2) Oh, you've redecorated. I don't like it.
Oh. Oh yeah? Oh, you never do. Listen, we're going to the National Gallery. The Zygons are underneath it.
Science leads, Kate. Is that what you meant? Is that what your father meant?
Space-Time Telegraph, Kate. A gift from me to your father, hotline straight to the Tardis.
I know about the Black Archive and I know about the security protocol. Kate, please. Please tell me you are not about to do something unbelievably stupid.
Not as sorry as you will be. This is not a decision you will ever be able to live with.
Kate, we're trying to bring the Tardis in. Why can't we land?
No, Kate, please. Just listen to me!
The Tower of London, totally Tardis-proof.
Alien technology plus human stupidity. Trust me, it's unbeatable.
Yeah, we do. A tiny bit. Try and keep up.
What happened?
Take a look at your phone and confirm who you're talking to.
You were just talking to me. I know. I'm a time traveller, figure it out. I need you to send the Gallifrey Falls painting to the Black Archive. Understood?
I'm the Doctor.
Sorry about the Dalek.
Kate Lethbridge Stewart, what in the name of sanity are you doing?
Except make you both agree to halt it.
Once. Turned me into the man I am now. I'm not even sure who that is any more.
You tell yourself it's justified, but it's a lie. Because what I did that day was wrong. Just wrong.
And, because I got it wrong, I'm going to make you get it right.
Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both of you, together.
Then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty of all time.
Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides.
And the key to perfect negotiation?
Not knowing what side you're on.
So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out
No one in this room will be able to remember if they're human
Or Zygon.
Whoops a daisy.
Peace in our time.
These events should be time-locked. We shouldn't even be here.
So something let us through.
All those years, burying you in my memory.
Pretending you didn't exist. Keeping you a secret, even from myself.
Pretending you weren't the Doctor, when you were the Doctor more than anybody else.
You were the Doctor on the day it wasn't possible to get it right.
But this time
You don't have to do it alone.
What we do today is not out of fear or hatred. It is done because there is no other way.
And it is done in the name of the many live we are failing to save.
What? What is it? What?
No, it's something. Tell me.
There isn't anything we can do.
He's right. There isn't another way. There never was. Either I destroy my own people or let the universe burn.
And what am I?
Yes. Maybe, yes.
Then what do I do?
Never cruel or cowardly.
You're not actually suggesting that we change our own personal history?
We change history all the time. I'm suggesting far worse.
Gentlemen, I have had four hundred years to think about this. I've changed my mind.
Yeah, there is. There is.
But there's something those billion billion Daleks don't know.
Because if they did, they'd probably send for reinforcements.
This time, there's three of us.
Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting that too! That is brilliant!
Ha, ha, ha! I've been thinking about it for centuries.
Eh? Who did?
Sorry, did you just say Bad Wolf?
The Sky Trench is holding, but what if the whole planet just disappeared?
The Daleks would be firing on each other. They'd destroy themselves in their own crossfire.
Frozen. Frozen in an instant of time, safe and hidden away.
Exactly.
Hello, hello, Gallifrey High Command, this is the Doctor speaking.
Hello! Also the Doctor. Can you hear me?
General, we have a plan.
We should point at this moment, it is a fairly terrible plan
And almost certainly won't work.
I was happy with fairly terrible.
Sorry, just thinking out loud.
We're flying our three Tardises into your lower atmosphere.
We're positioned at equidistant intervals around the globe. Equidistant. So grown up.
We're going to freeze Gallifrey.
Using our Tardises, we're going to freeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time.
Except we're going to do it to a whole planet.
And all the people on it.
Because the alternative is burning.
And I've seen that.
And I never want to see it again.
You would have hope. And right now, that is exactly what you don't have.
Oh, hundreds and hundreds.
But don't worry, I started a very long time ago.
Calling the War Council of Gallifrey. This is the Doctor.
You might say I've been doing this all my lives.
Good luck.
Standing by.
Ready.
Commencing calculations.
Soon be there.
Across the boundaries that divide one universe from another.
Just got to lock on to his coordinates.
And for my next trick.
Okay. Gentlemen, we're ready. Geronimo!
Allons-y!
What is it actually called?
Well, there's some debate. Either No More or Gallifrey Falls.
How did it get here?
No idea.
There's always something we don't know, isn't there?
Likewise.
Doctor.
The time streams are out of sync. You can't retain it, no.
I won't remember either, so you might as well tell me.
Tell you what?
Where it is we're going that you don't want to talk about.
I saw Trenzalore, where we're buried. We die in battle among millions.
That's not how it's supposed to be.
That's how the story ends. Nothing we can do about it. Trenzalore is where you're going.
Oh, never say nothing. Anyway, good to know my future is in safe hands. Keep a tight hold on it, Clara.
Trenzalore. We need a new destination, because I don't want to go.
He always says that.
How did you know?
Ah.
I could be a curator. I'd be great at curating. I'd be the Great Curator. I could retire and do that. I could retire and be the curator of this place.
I never forget a face.
Which title? There's two. No More or Gallifrey Falls.
That Gallifrey didn't fall. It worked. It's still out there.
Then where is it?
Do I?
Is that what I'm supposed to do now? Go looking for Gallifrey?
Thank you very much.
Clara sometimes asks me if I dream. Of course I dream, I tell her. Everybody dreams. But what do you dream about, she'll ask. The same thing everybody dreams about, I tell her. I dream about where I'm going. She always laughs at that. But you're not going anywhere, you're just wandering about.
That's not true. Not any more. I have a new destination. My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyones. It's taken me so many years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going.
Where I've always been going. Home, the long way round.

Good. That means the gravitational bearing must have rectified itself.
What do you mean, dear boy? I'm still here.
What? Oh, nonsense, child. Nonsense.
You're wrong. This is something far more serious. We're in grave danger. This is some form of attack!
That may be, my boy, but wherever it is, it has great power and can penetrate our safety barrier.
Don't just stand there, dear boy, turn on the scanner.
Don't ask questions, child. There isn't time. Turn on the scanner.
Yes, it is. When it isn't working, the screen is not as clear as that. This is part of the same trick.
That might be worse, my dear. Besides, I'm not only invisible, I'm intangible, which means that I can't pull the switches.
No! Whatever it is, we shall have to face up to it. Open the doors.
Open the doors!
Hmm? What is it?
Oh, you can see me?
Well, splendid. Splendid.
Well, I'm not quite sure, dear boy, but it's, it's somewhat familiar.
No, wait, child, wait.
Well, I don't think it was the Refusian's influence that made me become intangible. No, I think it was something here, and I don't like the feel of the place anymore than you do but we have to face up to it. You know, I think I was meant to come here.
But I believe I now know where we are.
Now turn around this instant! Turn away from it, dear boy! We're now in the world of The Celestial Toymaker, and that screen is hypnotic. He's trying to dominate your mind.
There is nothing there. Do you understand me? There is nothing there at all. You must believe me.
Come here, child. Now whatever you do, you must not allow yourself to be trapped into looking at it.
He's a power for evil. He manipulates people and makes them into his playthings. Whatever you do, neither of you must look at that screen. It's a trap.
You! I might have guessed.
Turn away from it this instant!
You and your inventions, ha! Now, both of you, be very careful. This place is a hidden menace. Nothing is just for fun.
He's trying to get us into his power. That's why we've got to fight him.
My dear, but how? That is the question.
No!
You will kindly cease this practical joking, and let us go at once.
And now you have, so let us go.
And very wise I was, too. You and your games are quite notorious. You draw people here like a spider does to flies.
And should they lose the game they play, you condemn them to become your toy forever.
And if I refuse?
No, I do not. I should never have left the Tardis.
Another one of your conjuring tricks. What game is it you want me to play?
The trilogic game?
You infer that my mind is getting weak and old?
How dare you.
Of course I can.
You need me?
As you said, if I win the game, I can go.
I am only allowed to move one piece at a time.
And I am not permitted to put a larger piece on a small piece.
I see. Can I begin?
You are not asking them to play this game.
Competitive? And who are the others?
Quest? What quest?
Dodo? Steven? This is the Doctor. The game you're going to play is not so innocent as it looks. Be on your guard.
If you lose this game, we shall be here forever. So watch out for
I must warn them.
You are overreaching yourself, Toymaker. How can I play this game?
I haven't made a mistake yet.
They'll win, too.
What do you mean?
That game? I might have known.
Steven! Dodo! Take care. It's chair number
Throughout this game you have spent a great deal of trouble in trying to break my concentration. And it's very unlikely that you will succeed now.
You seem to say quite enough for both of us. In any case, I'm busy.
I think your friend Cyril won't do so well when Steven catches up with him.
Well, I was right.
No. Not yet. Excuse me. (switches on the monitor) Yes, I see Steven and Dodo have found the Tardis. One little trick, and your little trick is broken. I am now visible.
I am glad you take it so calmly. Well now, if you will excuse me, I will go and see if the Tardis is all right.
Well done, my boy.
Yes, I'm back with you. Well done. I'm very glad to hear that you're bringing logic into your guesses.
Yes, my dear, and I think it was high time that we were off.
Well, I don't think that's going to be likely, dear boy.
Oh, my dear friend, don't waste our time on trivial formalities. You have been defeated, so now leave us alone.
Now don't start red herrings, you charlatan.
No, my dear boy. He's just tricking us into despair. Take no notice of him.
Well, I am compelled to tell the truth. It is possible that the Toymaker can drag us down in defeat with him, unless
Well, it's all very simple. It's a matter of the battle of our brains.
Yes, we still have a chance, but we must proceed with cunning.
Well said, my boy, well said.
Oh, it's no use, Steven. Leave him.
He's using his mind to turn your strength against yourself. Now, go back into the Tardis. I will deal with him.
Never! Never, my friend. You have been defeated.
What have you done? Stop meddling with my ship!
Your infantile behaviour is beyond a joke. No. Of course, I mustn't. You very nearly caught me then.
But if I do, this place vanishes.
And if this place vanishes, then the Tardis and the rest of us, will vanish also.
Close the doors, my boy.
It's no use.
If we destroy the Toymaker, we destroy this world.
I don't think neither of you understand. As the games are over, and won by us, everything outside the Tardis disappears. And if we are there, we disappear also.
But it will, my dear, the moment I go out there and make the final move of the trilogic game.
Oh, he won't be.
If the Toymaker loses the game, his world will vanish, but he has the power to build a new one.
The Toymaker is immortal. He's lasted for thousands of years. Very occasionally, of course, he loses a game, and then he has to pay the price.
Yes, but he himself is not destroyed. He goes on forever.
There must be a way.
Will you leave my ship alone? Do you hear me? Will you leave my ship alone?
Let me have the trilogic game in here.
It will make no difference to you. You can build a new world.
I will not come out and make that final move.
Oh, nonsense, dear boy. You don't want to disappear.
Yes, well, that's very noble and kind of you, but I absolutely forbid it. You've done quite enough in getting the Tardis back.
We can! That's just it. That's just what we can do. Listen to me. I will make that final move.
Go back to the trilogic game. Are you ready?
Very well. (whispers) Preset for dematerialisation. (loud) Go to move 1,023! (nothing, so he imitates the Toymaker's voice) Go from move 1,023! Master switch!
My dear boy, it was your very idea. Your very idea. Don't you see? When the Toymaker wanted to move the pieces, he had to command them in a certain tone of voice to make them move at all.
Yes, but in the first place, you see, I couldn't, because I used my own voice.
Exactly, dear boy, exactly. Therefore, I had to imitate the Toymaker's voice to make them obey me, and they did.
Oh, my dear, don't talk too soon. The mind is indestructible. So is the Toymaker.
Yes, just at this moment, but there will be other meetings in an other time.
Yes, you're quite right, my dear, but anyway, let us cheer up. After all we did win the games.
With what?
What are those?
This is really interesting. The last present from the Toymaker. I wonder.

Clara, I want you to step inside the Tardis. I don't want you to talk, I want you to do as I ask. Please.
Yes, I'm really here. I'm back. Now get inside the Tardis.
I know what this is. I know what's happening, and I know what's at stake.
Happy Easter.
Nobody likes the tangerines.
There's something you have to ask yourself, and it's important. Your life may depend on it. Everybody's life. Do you really believe in Santa Claus?
Deaf. Blind. How can they see us? How do they even know that we're here?
Oh, telepathic. They can home in on their own image in someone else's brain. Third-party perception. Mind piracy. We're being hacked.
The visual input from your optic nerve is being streamed to their brains. Stop broadcasting. Close your eyes.
It's because you're still thinking about them. So long as you retain them as an active memory, they can still home in. Think about something else.
(sotto) She's running interference. She's trying to distract herself. Three hundred and four minus seventeen.
Plus twenty. Just do it!
Minus fourteen, times four.
Stop being so good at arithmetic.
Danny Pink! What is Danny Pink up to right now? He's probably flirting with your neighbour or texting women of low moral character.
I was only
No, he's not.
Come on, quick, quick, quick, come on!
No!
Oh, take a guess. Go on, push the boat out. Tooth Fairy, maybe? Easter Bunny?
Oh, very good.
I've heard of them.
Colloquially known as the Dream Crabs.
I don't know. Possibly.
Oh, definitely.
Guess.
Do you believe that?
Theorise.
And?
Meaning?
Go to the window.
Because it gets worse.
That's how Clara and I got here.
Technically, in a telephone kiosk.
Because it's a spaceship in disguise. You know what the big problem is in telling fantasy and reality apart?
They're both ridiculous.
Exactly.
Oh, we are well way past danger, Clara. If I'm right, and I usually am, we're dying.
I like you. Straight to the point. I want you to show me how you first encountered those creatures, and what happened to those people in the infirmary. I notice you all wear mini-cams, so I assume that there is footage.
If it helps, so am I.
Ashley, what's this polar base for? Why are you all here?
I know. I had to flood your mind with random emotion.
You never told me he was dead. You said he made it back.
I never found Gallifrey. I lied, so you'd stay with Danny.
Yes.
Oh, complicated.
No idea.
Trust nothing. Accept nothing you see. Whatever happens, interrogate everything.
In case it's a lie.
You all right?
You don't seem much like a scientist.
Why are you out here? What brought you to the North Pole?
You missed the killer question.
Beardy-Weirdy.
How do you get all the presents in the sleigh?
What am I looking at?
What is your main mission?
Until you looked at them too long. Till you thought about them.
Sleeping. Probably been down there for centuries.
They can detect their own mental picture in any nearby mind.
Oh. That was always the legend. You think about a Dream Crab, a Dream Crab is coming for you.
Okay, then what?
Face huggers?
There's a horror movie called Alien? That's really offensive. No wonder everyone keeps invading you.
And then they became aggressive.
It would take the Dream Crab a little while to take control. Depends how much of the host brain was
Digested.
Depends what you call alive.
No. No, no. no, no, no. The Dream Crab induces a dream state. Keeps you happy and relaxed, in a perfectly realised dream world, as you dissolve. Merciful, I suppose.
Compared to that turkey leg you keep eating. Could you rewind for me? I'd like to see them dormant again. Clara, could you fetch me the dead one?
Ooh. Yes, and a punch in the face, too.
Fair enough.
We're thinking about it. Clara!
You are dying.
Dying! Dying! Clara! Clara! Clara!
Clara!
Clara, you're dreaming. You're dying. Can you hear me? Clara?
Okay, we kill it. We find a way to kill it and we get it off of her. How do we kill it?
Santa. In the infirmary, you told the Sleepers to go to bed, and they obeyed you.
No, but you can get back in there unharmed.
And how would you know that? How did you become an expert on what does and doesn't exist?
Good. Because there is only one way that I can communicate with Clara.
Hi.
It's not real, Clara. You know it's not real. It's a dream, and it's killing you.
Not as well as you, clearly. You've made him a fraction taller. Merry Christmas, PE.
Dialogue's pretty good, too. Nice work. It's all in the detail.
He's not real, Clara. None of this is real. What's real is there is an alien organism wrapped around your face, keeping you warm and happy while it eats you.
You're dying.
There was only one way to get to you.
I'm dying, too.
You have a pain right here. It's like an ice cream pain, but gentle. Do you know what that is? The skin and bone have been parted, probably half an inch, and something has pushed right into the soft tissue of your brain and is very slowly dissolving it. I want you to picture it this way. Somebody has put a straw right through your skull and is drinking you. You should be screaming with agony, but there's anaesthetic. Everything around you right now, even Danny, especially Danny, that's the anaesthetic.
Because it's true. How long do you think you've been here?
No. No, no, no. Barely five minutes. Because dream time goes faster. Because this isn't real. Danny isn't real. Danny Pink died saving the world.
I'm sorry. I thought there was a way back for him, but I was wrong. I can't change that. He's dead.
Minutes, till it's irreversible.
Brave.
I don't know. Just try. Accept this isn't real, and try.
Clara? Clara, look at me, Clara! Clara! Breathe, breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
The carnivore's hazard. Food has teeth too. You okay?
Good. There are some things we should never be okay about.
No. And the pain's still there, isn't it?
But only on one side, just that spot there. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Theorise.
Do you? And have you ever woken up from a dream and discovered that you're still dreaming? Dreams within dreams. Dream states nested inside each other. All perfectly possible, especially when we are dealing with creatures who have weaponised our dreams against us.
Which is odd, when you think about it.
Impossible, in fact. How can any of us be awake?
Remember how we all first met, in the infirmary?
Come on, quick, quick, come on.
All those creatures coming down from the ceiling, attacking us.
We never stood a chance. How did we survive that?
Yeah, we were rescued. And who was it that rescued us?
The Helman-Ziegler test. The only reliable dream test that I know. Ah. Your base manual. I take it none of you have memorised this.
These books should be identical in the real world. But as they don't exist in your memory, in a dream, they can't be. Agreed? Clara. Give me any two digit number.
All right, all of you, turn to page fifty seven and look at the very first word. Right, when I point at you.
Well?
Well, we'll do it again. Clara?
Twenty four.
Shona?
The attack is still going on. This is it!
Seriously? You're trying to help?
This makes perfect sense. The Dream Crab tries to make the dream as real as possible to trap you inside it. It creates dreams within dreams so you can never be sure if you are really awake. But your brain knows something is wrong. Your subconscious fights back.
Exactly.
No. No, no. Hang on. No, no, no, no.
It's a spaceship in disguise.
Shut up, Santa.
Look. No. Look, we don't need all this touchy-feely stuff.
No. No, No, no, no. Line in the sand. Santa Claus does not do the scientific explanation.
Why don't you just go and, and make a naughty list?
Don't give me that. Look, you're supposed to be warm and friendly and cheerful.
Don't be so hostile,
I'm not very good with this holdy-hand thing.
I
Oh no, I'm fine, I'm fine. This is very Christmassy, isn't it?
We're waking up. That part of the dream is over. We're on our own now.
That pain in your head. Make it worse. Head towards it.
Only a few moments will have passed at the most. The attack is still in progress.
Congratulations. That means you're not an idiot.
Last time wasn't real.
Run!
Clara!
Clara? Come on!
Everyone all right? Good. Bye.
No need for chatting, you'll only get attached. This isn't Facebook.
Oh, they're fine.
Beyond help.
Only if they're stupid. There are polar bears on this ice cap. Am I supposed to do something about that, too?
There are lots of dangerous things on this funny little planet of yours, Clara, most of which you eat. I'm the Doctor, not your mam.
Four. Four patients. Four manuals. Hurry! Do you know what I hate about the obvious?
Missing it.
As you were. No saluting. Are you the same people as before?
Oh, sorry, I deleted you.
Four manuals, yes?
One each.
Well, the problem is, you can't see the problem. For instance, you, gobby one.
Doesn't matter. I don't need it. When we first met you in the infirmary, what were you doing?
Uptight boss one. (another manual) What is the primary mission of this polar base?
Sexy one. What brings you to the North Pole at your age?
If you think that's freaky, try this. We were in the Tardis. Why did
Dreams. They're funny. Ha, ha, ha. They're disjointed. They're, they're silly. They're full of gaps. But you don't notice, because the dream protects itself. Stops you asking the right questions. For example, why do you have four manuals, one each, when you have a crew of eight? Or did you forget about your friends in the infirmary here?
Dreams within dreams, I warned you.
No one knows they're not dreaming. Not one of us. Not ever. Not for one single moment of our lives. Clara? Page number. Make it a good one.
And who's going to be the first to admit it?
That the pain is still there.
Yes, there is an alien organism in your brain, eating it. Of course it's getting worse.
Factually, getting up. Significantly, sensing the endgame.
Well, look at them. Go on. Look at them. Look at them properly. Look who they are. They're you. The Sleepers are you.
Because we're dreaming, all of us. This base isn't real. None of us are actually standing in the room. I'm probably asleep in my Tardis. Clara, you must be in bed. God knows where the rest of you are, probably scattered all over the world. But wherever you are, the Dream Crabs have got us, and we're all being networked into the same nightmare.
It's your subconscious again. The Sleepers represent the part of your mind that's already surrendered to the attack. These are dream images of what's coming to kill you.
No, it's a metaphorical construct representing a psychic attack within a shared dreamscape. Do please keep up.
Don't get too close.
Because this is a nightmare.
No! Clara!
Look out, they're coming through. Out! Outside, now! Run, run, run, run! Run! Clara, run. Run, all of you, run. Run!
This dream just killed your friend. Start taking it seriously.
He probably just woke up somewhere in the real world, dead. If we don't wake up now, we'll do the same.
I don't know.
The Tardis! Come on! Come on!
Well, let's hope that I dreamed it really well, then.
Of course it's us. We're dreaming too.
The logic of a nightmare.
We have to leave this place.
Use your imagination.
Dream yourselves home.
Come on, it's Christmas, the North Pole. Who you gonna call?
Could be. Well, I hope so. Waking up or
Just focus on this. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
You're a dream construct, currently representing either my recovering or expiring mind.
Yeah. All right.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
No, no, no! Oh, ho ho! Ah!
Look at me. Look. Look at me!
Look at me! I'm riding a sleigh. I'm riding a sleigh. Yippee ai-yay!
Oh. Maybe you could
Possibly. With any luck, we'll all wake up in our proper times and places.
Well, we could all be from different time zones. Time travel is always possible, in dreams.
The chances of you remembering any of this are very slim.
We stay, we die, Clara.
Clara!
Oh, Clara. I might have known that you would be the one to sleep in. Okay, I tracked the psychic signal here. I'm pretty sure that I know how to do this now. One of the advantages of actually being awake. So, you just hold still. I've just got to zap the neural centres.
Okay, there you go.
The Dream Crabs must have got to me first then found you in my memory. The others were collateral damage. Well, good to see you properly at last. How long has it been? Clara.
I've missed you, too.
These are Christmas hats, I've seen people use them. You put them on and absolutely anything seems funny.
Probably not. You want to try?
Clara Oswald, you will never look any different to me. So, how was it then?
The sixty two years that I missed.
Is there a Mister Clara?
They all turned you down though?
Regrets?
Yeah, they're always the best part. Christmas cracker. We should do one. No one ever matched up to Danny, eh?
Why not?
We should do this every Christmas.
I'm sorry. I was stupid. I should have come back earlier. I wish that I had.
No. I'm not still
Clara!
No idea.
Is that any good?
The Tardis is outside.
So, all of time and all of space is sitting out there. A big blue box. Please, don't even argue.
Merry Christmas, Clara Oswald.
Do you know what's rarer? Second chances. I never get a second chance, so what happened this time? Don't even know who to thank.

Vavoom!
I can't believe I've never thought of this before. It's genius. Right. Landed. Come on.
DOCTOR; Planet One. The oldest planet in the universe. And there's a cliff of pure diamond, and according to legend, on the cliff there's writing. Letters fifty feet high. A message from the dawn of time And no one knows what it says, because no one's ever translated it.
Till today.
Us. The Tardis can translate anything. All we have to do is open the doors and read the very first words in recorded history.
Just followed the co-ordinates on the cliff face. Earth. Britain. one oh two am. No, pm. No, AD.
Well, yeah. The Romans invaded Britain several times during this period.
Hi.
Well, you're only human. Arise, Roman person.
You graffitied the oldest cliff face in the universe.
What's this?
Does it have a title?
Come on. Ya!
And it's a fairy tale, a legend. It can't be real.
No, but if you buried the most dangerous thing in the universe, you'd want to remember where you put it.
If the Pandorica is here, it contains the mightiest warrior in history. Now, half the galaxy would want a piece of that. Maybe even fight over it. We need to get down there.
The Underhenge.
It's a Pandorica.
There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior. A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.
You know fairy tales. A good wizard tricked it.
Sorry, what?
Your favourite school topic. Your favourite story. Never ignore a coincidence, unless you're busy. In which case, always ignore a coincidence.
Easily. Anyone can break into a prison. But I'd rather know what I'm going to find first.
How long do we have?
What kind of security?
What could need all that?
Think of the fear that went into making this box. What could inspire that level of fear? Hello, you. Have we met?
No idea.
The stones. These stones are great big transmitters, broadcasting a warning to everyone, everywhere, to every time zone. The Pandorica is opening.
Even poor Vincent heard it, in his dreams. But what's in there? What could justify all this?
Anything that powerful, I'd know about it. Why don't I know?
Oh.
Doing it.
Okay, should be feeding back to you now. River, what's out there?
River, quickly. Anything?
What kind of starships?
Yes. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Dalek fleet, minimum twelve thousand battleships, armed to the teeth. Ah! But we've got surprise on our side. They'll never expect three people to attack twelve thousand Dalek battleships. Because we'd be killed instantly. So it would be a fairly short surprise. Forget surprise.
No, Dalek ships. Listen to them. Those are Dalek ships.
Well, we need to start a fight, turn them on each other. I mean, that's easy. It's the Daleks. They're so cross.
Sontarans! Talk about cross, who stole all their handbags?
What are you? What could you possibly be?
Run where?
The greatest military machine in the history of the universe.
No. No, no, no, no, no. The Romans.
Nothing, as far as I know.
One problem at a time. There's forcefield technology inside this box. If I can enhance the signal, I could extend it all over Stonehenge. Could buy us half an hour.
There are fruit flies live on Hoppledom Six that live for twenty minutes and they don't even mate for life. There was going to be a point to that. I'll get back to you.
I'm sorry?
No. No, no, that's er, a memory. A friend of mine. Someone I lost. Do you mind?
People fall out of the world sometimes, but they always leave traces. Little things we can't quite account for. Faces in photographs, luggage, half eaten meals, rings. Nothing is ever forgotten, not completely. And if something can be remembered, it can come back.
Remember that night you flew away with me?
And you asked me why I was taking you and I told you there wasn't a reason. I was lying.
Your house.
It was too big. Too many empty rooms. Does it ever bother you, Amy, that your life doesn't make any sense?
Okay, I need a proper look. Got to draw its fire, give it a target.
You know how sometimes I have really brilliant ideas?
Sorry.
Look at me, I'm a target!
Cyberarm. Arm of Cyberman.
Oh, sort of part man, part robot. The organic part must have died out years ago. Now the robot part is looking for, well, fresh meat.
It's just like being an organ donor, except you're alive and sort of screaming. I need to get round behind it. Could you draw its fire?
You'll be fine if you're quick. It's only got one arm, literally.
Come here!
Scrambled its circuits, but stay where you are, it could be bluffing.
I said stay where you are!
Amy!
Amy? Where's Amy?
Okay. Yes, she's sedated, that's all. Half an hour, she'll be fine. Okay, Romans. Good. I was just wishing for Romans. Good old River. How many?
Fifty? You're not exactly a legion.
Yes, I know that, Rory. I'm not exactly one to miss the obvious. But we need everything we can get. Okay, Cyberweapons. This is basically a sentry box, so headless wonder here was a sentry. Probably got himself duffed up by the locals. Never underestimate a Celt.
Hush, Rory. Thinking. Why leave a Cyberman on guard, unless it's a Cyberthing in the box. But why would they lock up one of their own? Okay, no, not a Cyberthing, but what? What? No, I'm missing something obvious, Rory. Something big. Something right slap in front of me. I can feel it.
I'll get it in a minute.
Hello again.
How've you been?
Rory, I'm not trying to be rude, but you died.
You died and then you were erased from time. You didn't just die, you were never born at all. You never existed.
How can you be here?
Fuzzy?
The final phase. It's opening.
Yes. Now hurry up and
Get the Tardis here. I need equipment. What are you? They're all here, all of them, all for you. What could you possibly be?
Sorry, sorry, dropped it. Hello, Stonehenge! Who takes the Pandorica, takes the universe. But bad news, everyone,
Because guess who? Ha! Listen, you lot, you're all whizzing about. It's really very distracting. Could you all just stay still a minute because I am talking! The question of the hour is, who's got the Pandorica? Answer, I do. Next question. Who's coming to take it from me? Come on! Look at me. No plan, no back up, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else. I don't have anything to lose! So, if you're sitting up there in your silly little spaceship, with all your silly little guns, and you've got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.
That'll keep them squabbling for half an hour. Romans.
If I can stop whatever's in this box getting out, then they'll go home.
Rory, I'm sorry. You're going to have to be very brave now.
Ah.
Just your basic knock-out drops. Get some fresh air, you'll be fine.
Not remotely, but it's fresh.
Because you never existed.
There are cracks. Cracks in time. There's going to be a huge explosion in the future, on one particular day. And every other moment in history is cracking around it.
Amy's time.
Doesn't matter. The cracks are everywhere now. Get too close to them and you can fall right out of the universe.
Basically.
I don't know, you shouldn't have. What happened? From your point of view, what physically happened?
Oh, shut up.
Go get her.
Because you are. The universe is big. It's vast and complicated and ridiculous, and sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them miracles, and that's the theory. Nine hundred years, never seen one yet, but this would do me. Now get upstairs. She's Amy and she's surrounded by Romans. I'm not sure history can take it.
The Tardis, where is it? Hurry up.
What are you even doing there?
Something's using her memories. Amy's memories.
You said something had been there.
If they've been to her house, they could have used her psychic residue. Structures can hold memories, that's why houses have ghosts. They could've taken a snapshot of Amy's memories. But why?
Projections, or duplicates.
They might think they're real. The perfect disguise. They actually believe their own cover story, right until they're activated.
Why? Who'd do that? What for? It doesn't make sense.
River? River?
River, what's happening?
You're flying it wrong.
Where are you? What's the date reading?
You need to get out of there now. Any other time zone.
Just go.
Well, then shut down the Tardis. Shut down everything!
But how? Why?
Listen to me, just land her anywhere. Emergency landing, now. There are cracks in time. I've seen them everywhere, and they're getting wider. The Tardis exploding is what causes them, but we can stop the cracks ever happening if you just land her.
Well, now. Ready to come out, are we?
Okay, just walk out of the doors. If there's no one inside, the Tardis engines shut down automatically.
Just get out of there.
Run!
Amy!
Plastic Romans. Duplicates, driven by the Nestene Consciousness, eh? Deep cover, but what for? What are you doing? What's in there, eh? What's coming out?
What, do you mean it's open?
Scanned? Scanned by what, a box?
Ready for what?
You lot, working together. An alliance. How is that possible?
What? And you've come to me for help?
From me?
No, no, no. You've got it wrong.
No. no, no, not me, the Tardis. And I'm not in the Tardis, am I?
Please, listen to me!
Total event collapse! Every sun will supernova at every moment in history. The whole universe will never have existed. Please, listen to me!
No! Please, listen to me! The Tardis is exploding right now and I'm the only one who can stop it! Listen to me!

Come on, Pond.
Now do you believe me?
I've extended the air shell. We're fine.
Now that's interesting. Twenty ninth century. Solar flares roast the earth, and the entire human race packs its bags and moves out till the weather improves. Whole nations.
Migrating to the stars.
Isn't that amazing?
Well, come on. I've found us a spaceship. This is the United Kingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland. All of it, bolted together and floating in the sky. Starship UK. It's Britain, but metal. That's not just a ship, that's an idea. That's a whole country, living and laughing and shopping. Searching the stars for a new home.
Course we can. But first, there's a thing.
An important thing. In fact, Thing One. We are observers only. That's the one rule I've always stuck to in all my travels. I never get involved in the affairs of other peoples or planets.
Ooo, that's interesting.
Oh, lovely. You're a cheery one. Never mind dead, look at this place. Isn't it wrong?
Come on, use your eyes. Notice everything. What's wrong with this picture?
Says the girl in the nightie.
Now, come on, look around you. Actually look.
Life on a giant starship. Back to basics. Bicycles, washing lines, wind-up street lamps. But look closer. Secrets and shadows, lives led in fear. Society bent out of shape, on the brink of collapse. A police state. Excuse me.
Sorry. Checking all the water in this area. There's an escaped fish. Where was I?
Don't know. I think a lot. It's hard to keep track. Now, police state. Do you see it yet?
There.
Crying silently. I mean, children cry because they want attention, because they're hurt or afraid. But when they cry silently, it's because they just can't stop. Any parent knows that.
Hundreds of parents walking past who spot her and not one of them's asking her what's wrong, which means they already know, and it's something they don't talk about. Secrets. They're not helping her, so it's something they're afraid of. Shadows, whatever they're afraid of, it's nowhere to be seen, which means it's everywhere. Police state.
Deck two oh seven. Apple Sesame block, dwelling 54A. You're looking for Mandy Tanner. Oh, er, this fell out of her pocket when I accidentally bumped into her. Took me four goes. Ask her about those things. The smiling fellows in the booths. They're everywhere.
They're clean. Everything else here is all battered and filthy. Look at this place. But no one's laid a finger on those booths. Not a footprint within two feet of them. Look. Ask Mandy, why are people scared of the things in the booths?
It's this or Leadworth. What do you think? Let's see. What will Amy Pond choose? Ha ha, gotcha. Meet me back here in half an hour.
What I always do. Stay out of trouble. Badly.
Yes.
DOCTOR; Can't be.
You know me?
Who says I see anything?
No engine vibration on deck. Ship this size, engine this big, you'd feel it. The water would move. So, I thought I'd take a look. It doesn't make sense. These power couplings, they're not connected. Look. Look, they're dummies, see? And behind this wall, nothing. It's hollow. If I didn't know better, I'd say there was
But it's working. This ship is travelling though space. I saw it.
How?
Who are you? How do I find you again?
Amy?
What have you done?
Yeah, your basic memory wipe job. Must have erased about twenty minutes.
Did you?
And once every five years, everyone chooses to forget what they've learned. Democracy in action.
Oh, I'm way worse than Scottish. I can't even see the movie. Won't play for me.
The difference being the computer doesn't accept me as human.
No, you look Time Lord. We came first.
No. There were, but there aren't. Just me now. Long story. There was a bad day. Bad stuff happened. And you know what? I'd love to forget it all, every last bit of it, but I don't. Not ever. Because this is what I do, every time, every day, every second. This. Hold tight. We're bringing down the government.
Say wheee!
Argh! High speed air cannon. Lousy way to travel.
Six hundred feet down, twenty miles laterally, puts us at the heart of the ship. I'd say Lancashire. What's this then, a cave? Can't be a cave. Looks like a cave.
Yes, but only food refuse. Organic, coming through feeder tubes from all over the ship.
But feeding what, though?
Er, it's not a floor, it's a. So.
The next word is kind of a scary word. You probably want to take a moment, get yourself in a calm place. Go omm.
It's a tongue.
A tongue. A great big tongue.
Yes, yes, yes. But on the plus side, roomy.
How big is this beastie? It's gorgeous. Blimey, if this is just the mouth, I'd love to see the stomach. Though not right now.
Okay, it's being fed through surgically implanted feeder tubes, so the normal entrance is closed for business.
No, stop, don't move.
Too late. It's started.
Swallow reflex.
I'm vibrating the chemo-receptors.
The eject button.
Think about it!
Right, then. This isn't going to be big on dignity. Geronimo!
There's nothing broken, there's no sign of concussion and yes, you are covered in sick.
Overspill pipe, at a guess.
Oh, that's not the pipe.
One door, one door switch, one condition. We forget everything we saw. Look familiar?
That's the carrot. Ooo, here's the stick.
There's a creature living in the heart of this ship. What's it doing there?
No, that's not going to work on me, so come on. Big old beast below decks, and everyone who protests gets shoved down its throat. That how it works?
DOCTOR; Oh, stop it. I'm not leaving and I'm not forgetting, and what are you fellows going to do about it? Stick out your tongues, huh?
Look who it is. You look a lot better without your mask.
How did you find us?
You're over sixteen, you've voted. Whatever this is, you've chosen to forget about it.
Then who and what are you, and how do you know me?
Your family?
Liz Ten.
Exactly like a root. It's all one creature, the same one we were inside, reaching out. It must be growing through the mechanisms of the entire ship.
Oh, Amy. We should never have come here.
Why all the glasses?
A queen going undercover to investigate her own kingdom?
How old were you when you came to the throne?
And you always wear this in public?
Air-balanced porcelain. Stays on by itself, because it's perfectly sculpted to your face.
Oh, Liz. So everything.
Half Smiler, half human.
The lowest point of Starship UK. The dungeon.
There's children down here. What's all that about?
Yeah, look at us. Torture chamber of the Tower of London. Lucky, lucky, lucky. Except it's not a torture chamber, is it? Well, except it is. Except it isn't. Depends on your angle.
Well, like I say, it depends on the angle. It's either the exposed pain centre of big fella's brain, being tortured relentlessly.
Or it's the gas pedal, the accelerator. Starship UK's go faster button.
Don't you? Try to. Go on. The spaceship that could never fly. No vibration on deck. This creature, this poor, trapped, terrified creature. It's not infesting you, it's not invading, it's what you have instead of an engine. And this place down here is where you hurt it, where you torture it, day after day, just to keep it moving. Tell you what. Normally, it's above the range of human hearing. This is the sound none of you wanted to hear.
Liz. Your mask.
Look at it. It's old. At least two hundred years old, I'd say.
Yeah, an antique made by craftsmen over two hundred years ago and perfectly sculpted to your face. They slowed your body clock, all right, but you're not fifty. Nearer three hundred. And it's been a long old reign.
Ten years. And the same ten years, over and over again, always leading you here.
Because you knew if we stayed here, I'd be faced with an impossible choice. Humanity or the alien. You took it upon yourself to save me from that. And that was wrong. You don't ever decide what I need to know.
You did it. That's what counts.
Oh, I don't care. When I'm done here, you're going home.
Yeah, I know. You're only human.
The worst thing I'll ever do. I'm going to pass a massive electrical charge through the Star Whale's brain. Should knock out all its higher functions, leave it a vegetable. The ship will still fly, but the whale won't feel it.
Look, three options. One, I let the Star Whale continue in unendurable agony for hundreds more years. Two, I kill everyone on this ship. Three, I murder a beautiful, innocent creature as painlessly as I can. And then I find a new name, because I won't be the Doctor any more.
Nobody talk to me. Nobody human has anything to say to me today!
Come on, use your eyes. Notice everything. Notice everything.
Just me now.
Just me now.
Yes.
Amy, no! No!
Amy, what have you done?
Amy, you could have killed everyone on this ship.
And you saved it. I know, I know.
But you couldn't have known how it would react.
What?
Huh. Gotcha.
For the rest of their lives. Oh, the songs they'll write. Never mind them. Big day tomorrow.
Well, it's always a big day tomorrow. We've got a time machine. I skip the little ones.
Once, a long time ago.
Hello.
Well, it's a phone box. Would you mind?
Which Prime Minister?
Which British one?
Oh! Hello, dear. What's up?
Don't worry about a thing, Prime Minister.
We're on our way.

Yes. Oh, a little bit out of breath. Oh, that's quite understandable. After all, we're several thousand feet above sea level.
Well, I directed the ship towards Earth and it looks as though I've been successful.
That? Oh, I can't see anything without my glasses. Anyway, I don't like this place. You'll have to excuse me. I've got a lot of work to do first.
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. We're always in trouble, Isn't this extraordinary? It follows us everywhere.
All the lights in the ship have gone out. The whole circuit has burned itself to a cinder, and added to that it affected the water. We haven't got any.
Oh, the heating as well. Everything's gone to pot.
Serious. Are you telling? There's no need for you to tell me that, really.
Fuel? Now where on earth do you expect to find fuel here, hmm?
Oh well, I wish you luck.
You stay with me, child. You might be able to help me.
Now, Susan, go into the ship and fetch me the two L oh, will you? You know what it is. Even if I do find the fault, I don't suppose I shall be able to repair it before it gets dark, and then we shall all freeze to death.
I'm afraid it's going to need a new one, dear. It's going to take me days. Oh well, I don't know, really, I always seem to
Well, Chesterton?
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, but it's going to take such a long time. Time we don't have. Now the only chance is to try and get down to a lower altitude and, you know, before it gets cold and we
What's she talking about now?
Print? What sort of print? Paws, hooves, what?
And if it were, that means there's shelter nearby.
All right. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Thank you, my dear.
Oh, it's excellent nourishment, sir.
Oh we're travellers yes. That's my grandchild, Susan, and that's Miss Wright, and that's Charlton.
Thank you. You saved our lives.
Oh, there were two, young man, that I would like to ask.
What year is this and where are we, hmm?
That is why I'm asking you.
Twelve hundred and eighty nine. Ah..
Ping-Cho, this smells very, very good! What is it?
Allow me. (he tastes it) Oh, it's delicious, delicious.
You know, it's rather surprising to find the daughter of a high government official working as a servant in Marco Polo's caravan.
His name wouldn't be Tegana, would it?
Yes, Mongol fighting Mongol.
Yes, oh well, yes. Well, for an emissary of peace, he has rather blood-thirsty habits, doesn't he?
Yes, Messer Marco, it is different.
That is true.
Oh indeed? That's charming of you. Very charming of you. It won't take me very long to repair. A day or two. But I assure you that I shall not hold up your journey any longer than is necessary.
I see, and you will be taking us along with you, including the Tardis?
Oh good, good. Then I can work as we proceed.
Why not, hmm?
I see. You saved our lives, Messer Marco and the least we can do is to respect your wishes. No one will enter the Tardis until we reach Lop.
Oh, Messer Marco, these way-stations, do you have many of these in Cathay?
Yes?
Oh, excellent, excellent. If you'll pardon me, I have a lot of work to do and
What does this mean?
I don't wish to sit down. I want you to call your guards off.
No.
But I have work to do.
Oh, very well.
Oh, really?
Well, I really don't see what this has to do with my repairing the Tardis.
Well, ask the Khan again.
You're mad.
What? In Peking, or Shang Tu?
Oh, you think so, really? Oh no. Oh no.
And neither do you, young man.
Eventually. He doesn't know what he's talking about. The man's a lunatic. Ho.
Well, that is your problem, not mine.
Oh well, what a mess.
Yes. Go by sea, he says.
I know he is. Yes.
(in total hysterics) I haven't the faintest idea.
Marco, is this all we're going to get until tonight, hmm?
Susan.
Water! Susan, Susan, child. Susan, wake up. Wake up, quickly! Fetch some cloth and cups.
We must catch the water. We mustn't waste a drop! Come along, child, wake up, quickly! Look at it, streaming down the walls. Look. We must collect it. It's water!
We must. Quickly, quickly, before the ship heats up in the sun. Hurry, child. Hurry, please.
Please wait. We must be careful.
Yes, but it's not pure water you see.
I haven't got any water, don't you understand. I wouldn't allow us to get into this state if I had water, young man. No, this was the water that was running off the walls. It's condensation. It's unbelievable. Condensation, do you understand?
Chesterton, make him understand. It was condensation off the walls and I
You understand now?
Not too much. Steady.
I think I can repair the circuit in a week, maybe less.
Oh, we're always rushing around. A good day's rest would do us all a lot of good.
Oh, rubbish.
Well?
Young man, you have no concept of what is happening, have you? And you still don't seem to realise that you're speaking to a man of superior intellect.
It seems we shall be stopping here for a while. It means I can get on with more work.
Repairing the circuit, young man.
Don't you realise they will be much less vigilant? I shall be able to sneak into the Tardis, no worry at all.
A key, my boy. A key. What use do you think it's going to be to him, hmmm? And where do you suppose I got that from?
I made it.
On the night of the oasis. Only chance I had. She knows all about it, don't you, Susan?
Yes?
Well, now, let me think, let me think. Yes, they were some kind of sect. Why?
Oh, how delightful. Yes, yes, why not?
That was really delightful, Ping-Cho.
Do you need my help?
Don't worry, child. We'll find her. Don't worry.
Well, it looks as though I must, doesn't it? What is it, hmm?
Oh, where?
Do you know where this Cave of Five Hundred Eyes is?
Aha, my friend! And how long have you been lurking there, hmmm?
Where is the Cave of Five Hundred Eyes?
Yes. Where is it?
Well, how far is it from here?
A mile, a mile, yes. Now you two go back in there and wait. Go along, go along, go along.
Never mind about him. Which road?
Yes, all right, if you insist. Then come along, both of you, quickly.
How extraordinary. Look. Yes, it's quartz. Yes, a mineral ore. Look, you see the veins going through the rock structure. And look how cleverly that face is carved so that at the eye the quartz is exposed. Now, isn't that interesting, hmm?
Hmm? Barbara? Oh yes, of course. Yes, yes, we mustn't waste time. No. Come on. Now, let's see if we can find the spirits.
A fool's errand, it's a fool's errand, child. That's what you've brought me on. And I had so much work to do in the Tardis. Now, come along, we mustn't waste any more time here. Barbara's probably in bed and asleep by now. If you had any sense, where both of you should be.
Hmmm?
Miss Wright!
It must be your imagination, child. These eyes didn't move. It's quartz.
Oh rubbish, child.
Tegana!
If you must know, sir, we are looking for Miss Wright.
I think this is your answer. We found it.
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
Ian!
Over here.
Over here, my boy.
Just this handkerchief. We found that over there.
This man thinks this cave is haunted.
Oh, rubbish, child, rubbish.
Well, what are you looking for, Chesterton?
Oh, rubbish, rubbish.
What proof have you?
The trouble is, Polo's change of attitude has slowed down my progress on the circuit.
Well, with a bit more time, and a lot of luck, I should say about another night.
The following evening will even be better.
Yes, and a jolly good riddance.
What do you mean?
It's a pity there was any association at all. That Chinese child makes me nervous.
She found out about the key.
Yes, on the night that Barbara was captured. Susan and Ping-Cho thought Barbara had gone down to the cave and met with an accident, so they came looking for me just as I was about to enter the Tardis. It was then Ping-Cho saw the key.
There isn't very much more to do. I won't be long. Keep your eyes open.
No.
That is what you'll precisely have to do, Polo.
Put that key in the lock, Polo, and you will destroy the ship. Then where will your precious Khan be, hmmm? You need more than a key to enter my ship. You need knowledge. Knowledge you will never possess.
No, understand? No! I'd let you wreck it first!
Let go of me!
You poor, pathetic, stupid savage.
Yes, I quite agree with you. The ship's waiting outside, with the circuit finished and installed.
Oh, that wretched child.
Oh, my dear Susan
Yes, and the only way I can see it, is that we should have to capture Polo.
Now just a minute. First things first, young man. How are we going to get out of here, and remember that guard is out there watching for us, hmmm?
That's a very good idea. Good.
Right.
Don't worry, my child. I think by the time I've finished with that gentleman, he'll only be too glad to let us go.
What's the matter? Did you kill him?
Well, continue with our plan, get the keys, and get out of here as soon as possible.
Pardon me.
Well, we look a bit silly standing here, don't we?
Use the Tardis.
Yes, get out of here, anywhere where it's safe.
If you believe that, Polo, you're a bigger fool that even I think you are.
Well, we're not going to get very far with this overgrown bread knife! We shall have to use more enterprise than this.
No, it wasn't the devils in the fire. Their leader was killed. That's why they broke up and ran.
And few expect to meet it, hmm?
If that fool had any decency at all, he'd let us go.
Well, then we must go on trying to escape. The circuit's finished, and all we need are those keys.
We sacrificed our freedom to save you.
Huh. Very noble of you, I'm sure.
Thanks for nothing.
And the keys to the Tardis?
Strange that Tegana should watch the fire. A sort of menial job he'd order a guard to do.
Would he?
Of course he was. The bandit knew him. I'm certain he did.
Yes, and he had to kill him or be exposed.
My ship.
No, no, ssh ssh. We mustn't be impetuous. We must choose the right moment carefully.
But that's three hundred miles away, isn't it?
I would have thought it was a physical impossibility.
Three hundred miles a days on horseback. Very few people can ride more than twenty five.
And the Tardis?
Well, where is it?
The Tardis. Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
Polo?
I thought you said the Tardis was to be placed in the courtyard.
Where to?
The stables.
I could hardly have it placed in the hanging garden, now could I? What does he think it is? A potting shed, or something.
Yes, of course I have.
Dear, dear, dear, dear, haven't you any ideas?
What on Earth does that child think she's doing? Great Olympus!
There is no need.
Tell that man to take his hands off my grandchild.
So long as you're safe, Susan. That's all that matters.
It's all Chinese. Very interesting. It's odd that a Mongol should choose Chinese architecture, isn't it?
What size are the grounds?
Yes, well, one's enough for me, young man. Red, white or blue. VIZIER: When great Kublai Khan appears, you will make your obeisance to him. so that he may look kindly upon you, and spare your worthless lives.
Pray then, what am I supposed to do, sir?
I shall do no such thing!
Well, if it breaks my back, then he can take all of me. So why waste time on small items?
Oh, do be quiet child. I'm not going to make a spectacle of
Yes, yes, yes. I'll manage it.
It's my back.
It's broken!
I am not being impertinent, sir. I'm far from unwell.
I am not a doctor of medicine, sire, otherwise I should be able to cure these pains.
Oh, not another horse.
I said I don't think I could get on another horse.
In my present condition, sir? And what about that lump of yours, hmmm?
Well, he's lucky. He won't be jogged about.
Thank you.
Very well, very well.
It must be borne with dignity, sir.
My game.
Please.
Ah, yes it is, sire, yes.
Er, thirty-five elephants with ceremonial bridles, trappings, brocades and pavilions. Four thousand white stallions, and twenty-five tigers.
And the sacred tooth of Buddha which Polo brought over from India.
I'm very much afraid all the commerce from Burma for one year, sire.
The great Khan is far too modest, my lady.
How charming.
Genghis Khan? No, I didn't meet him, but I have heard of him. Yes.
Oh, then you've lost nothing, sire.
Well, one more game then, and if you win, you can take it all back again.
Well, er, Marco Polo has taken away my caravan and given it to you, sire. If I win, perhaps I could have my caravan back again?
But none of this is important to me, sire. You see, win or lose, you can have it all back again. But if I win, my ship, Tardis, comes back to me, hmm?
No, no, no.
Yes, Marco. We're playing for the Tardis.
My throw.
He gave me this. A consolation prize. A piece of his paper currency.
What's the point. We've tried everything.
I always knew Tegana was a two-faced villain.
It wasn't just my ship then. Whatever double-game Tegana is playing, he must have decided upon a long time before we appeared on the scene.
Hmmm?
And that's why he delayed Marco Polo's caravan. To give Noghai more time to move his armies nearer Peking.
Yes, but what you have to take into account where battles are concerned, dear boy, are its leaders. Kill the leader, and where are you? What happens? The whole army dissipates itself into chaos and utter confusion. It's happened throughout your history time and time again!
Exactly, and what could be a better answer then to disorganise everything here. It gives Noghai the perfect answer to overrun the country.
Yes, we've all had it.
Guard! Open the door.
Well, then, look, somebody must protect him.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Come along.

Could I have an apple? All I can think about. Apples. I love apples. Maybe I'm having a craving? That's new. Never had cravings before.
Whoa. Look at that.
Just had a fall. All the way down there, right to the library. Hell of a climb back up.
I was in the swimming pool.
So was the swimming pool.
Why? Did you call a policeman?
No, I'm fine. It's okay. This is all perfectly norm
I don't know yet. I'm still cooking. Does it scare you?
No, no, no. The crack in your wall. Does it scare you?
Well then, no time to lose. I'm the Doctor. Do everything I tell you, don't ask stupid questions, and don't wander off.
Early days. Steering's a bit off.
That's disgusting. What is that?
Apple's rubbish. I hate apples.
No, no, no. I like yoghurt. Yoghurt's my favourite. Give me yoghurt.
I hate yoghurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
New mouth. New rules. It's like eating after cleaning your teeth. Everything tastes wrong. Argh!
Wrong with me? It's not my fault. Why can't you give me any decent food? You're Scottish. Fry something.
Ah, bacon!
Bacon. That's bacon. Are you trying to poison me?
Ah, you see? Beans.
Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans. Bread and butter. Now you're talking.
And stay out!
Carrots? Are you insane? No. Wait. Hang on. I know what I need. I need, I need, I need fish fingers and custard.
Am I? Good. Funny's good. What's your name?
Oh, that's a brilliant name. Amelia Pond. Like a name in a fairy tale. Are we in Scotland, Amelia?
So what about your mum and dad, then? Are they upstairs? Thought we'd have woken them by now.
I don't even have an aunt.
I know. So, your aunt, where is she?
And she left you all alone?
Course, you're not. You're not scared of anything. Box falls out of the sky, man falls out of a box, man eats fish custard, and look at you, just sitting there. So you know what I think?
Must be a hell of a scary crack in your wall.
You've had some cowboys in here. Not actual cowboys, though that can happen.
She sounds good, your mum. I'll keep it for later. This wall is solid and the crack doesn't go all the way through it. So here's a thing. Where's the draught coming from?
Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. You know what the crack is?
It's a crack. But I'll tell you something funny. If you knocked this wall down, the crack would stay put, because the crack isn't in the wall.
Everywhere. In everything. It's a split in the skin of the world. Two parts of space and time that should never have touched, pressed together right here in the wall of your bedroom. Sometimes, can you hear?
Prisoner Zero?
It means that on the other side of this wall, there's a prison and they've lost a prisoner. And you know what that means?
You need a better wall. The only way to close the breach is to open it all the way. The forces will invert and it'll snap itself shut. Or
You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
Everything's going to be fine.
Hello? Hello?
There, you see? Told you it would close. Good as new.
No. I think that was Prisoner Zero's guard. Whatever it was, it sent me a message. Psychic paper. Takes a lovely little message. (reads) Prisoner Zero has escaped. But why tell us? Unless.
Unless Prisoner Zero escaped through here. But he couldn't have. We'd know.
It's difficult. Brand new me. Nothing works yet. But there's something I'm missing. In the corner of my eye.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I've got to get back in there. The engines are phasing. It's going to burn!
It's not a box. It's a time machine.
Not for much longer if I can't get her stabilised. Five minute hop into the future should do it.
Not safe in here. Not yet. Five minutes. Give me five minutes, I'll be right back.
Am I people? Do I even look like people? Trust me. I'm the Doctor.
Geronimo!
Amelia! Amelia, I worked out what it was. I know what I was missing! You've got to get out of there!
Amelia? Amelia, are you all right? Are you there?
Prisoner Zero's here. Prisoner Zero is here! Prisoner Zero is here! Do you understand me? Prisoner Zero is
Cricket bat. I'm getting cricket bat.
Well, that's much better. Brand new me. Whack on the head, just what I needed.
Hang on, no, wait. You're a policewoman.
But what are you doing here? Where's Amelia?
Yeah, Amelia. Little Scottish girl. Where is she? I promised her five minutes but the engines were phasing. I suppose I must have gone a bit far. Has something happened to her?
How long?
No. No. No. No, I can't be six months late. I said five minutes. I promised. What happened to her? What happened to Amelia Pond?
I need to speak to whoever lives in this house right now.
But you're the police.
How many rooms?
On this floor. How many rooms on this floor? Count them for me now.
Because it will change your life.
Six.
Look.
There's a perception filter all round the door. Sensed it the last time I was here. Should've seen it.
The filter stops you noticing. Something came a while ago to hide. It's still hiding, and you need to uncuff me now.
How can you have lost it? Stay away from that door! Do not touch that door! Listen to me, do not open that. Why does no-one ever listen to me? Do I just have a face that nobody listens to?
Again. My screwdriver, where is it?
Silver thing, blue at the end. Where did it go?
Whatever's there stopped you seeing the room.
What makes you think you could see it?
Now please, just get out.
My screwdriver, yeah.
Must have rolled under the door.
Get out of there.
Get out of there! Get out!
Get out of there!
What is it? What are you doing?
Corner of your eye.
Don't try to see it. If it knows you've seen it, it will kill you. Don't look at it. Do not look.
Get out!
Give me that.
Come on. What's the bad alien done to you?
I don't know. Getting dressed? Run. Just go. Your back up's coming. I'll be fine.
I heard you on the radio. You called for back up.
You're a policewoman.
No, it isn't. Look at the faces.
It's all one creature. One creature disguised as two. Clever old multi-form. A bit of a rush job, though. Got the voice a bit muddled, did you? Mind you, where did you get the pattern from? You'd need a psychic link, a live feed. How did you fix that?
Stay, boy! Her and me, we're safe. Want to know why? She sent for back up.
I know. That was a clever lie to save our lives. Okay, yeah, no back up. And that's why we're safe. Alone, we're not a threat to you. If we had back up, you'd have to kill us.
Well, that would be back up. Okay, one more time. We do have back up and that's definitely why we're safe.
Well, safe apart from, you know, incineration.
Come on, work, work, work, come on.
Run! Run!
Kissogram?
Why'd you pretend to be a policewoman?
An alien convict is hiding in your spare room disguised as a man and a dog, and some other aliens are about to incinerate your house. Any questions?
Me too. No, no, no, no! Don't do that, not now! It's still rebuilding. Not letting us in.
No, wait, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. The shed. I destroyed that shed last time I was here. Smashed it to pieces.
Yeah, but the new one's got old. It's ten years old at least. Twelve years. I'm not six months late, I'm twelve years late.
You said six months. Why did you say six months?
This matters. This is important. Why did you say six months?
What?
What?
What?
You're Amelia.
Amelia Pond. You're the little girl.
What happened?
You hit me with a cricket bat.
A cricket bat.
Four?
Why?
What's that? Why are you playing that?
Hello! Sorry to burst in. We're doing a special on television faults in this area. Also crimes. Let's have a look.
Who's Amy? You were Amelia.
Amelia Pond. That was a great name.
Not me. Brand new face First time on. And what sort of job's a kissogram?
You were a little girl five minutes ago.
I'm the Doctor. I'm worse than everybody's aunt. And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
Okay, so it's everywhere, in every language. They're broadcasting to the whole world.
Okay. Planet this size, two poles, your basic molten core? They're going to need a forty percent fission blast.
But they'll have to power up first, won't they? So assuming a medium sized starship, that's 20 minutes. What do you think, twenty minutes? Yeah, twenty minutes. We've got twenty minutes.
Cartoons?
The human residence. They're not talking about your house, they're talking about the planet. Somewhere up there, there's a spaceship, and it's going to incinerate the planet.
Twenty minutes to the end of the world.
What is this place? Where am I?
Where's the rest of it?
Is there an airport?
A nuclear power station?
Even a little one?
Nearest city?
We don't have half an hour. Do we have a car?
Well, that's good. Fantastic, that is. Twenty minutes to save the world and I've got a post office. And it's shut. What is that?
Why aren't there any ducks?
Then how do you know it's a duck pond?
I don't know. Why would I know? This is too soon. I'm not ready, I'm not done yet.
Nothing. You're looking at it through a forcefield. They've sealed off your upper atmosphere. Now they're getting ready to boil the planet. Oh, and here they come. The human race. The end comes, as it was always going to, down a video phone.
Why would I wind you up?
And you believed me.
Oh, you never want to do that. No. Hang on. Shut up. Wait. I missed it. I saw it and I missed it. What did I see? I saw. What did I see? I saw, I saw, I saw
Twenty minutes. I can do it. Twenty minutes, the planet burns. Run to your loved ones and say goodbye, or stay and help me.
I'm sorry?
Amy, no, no, what are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?
You know who I am.
Look at the sky. End of the world, twenty minutes.
Catch.
I'm the Doctor. I'm a time traveller. Everything I told you twelve years ago is true. I'm real. What's happening in the sky is real, and if you don't let me go right now, everything you've ever known is over.
Just twenty minutes. Just believe me for twenty minutes. Look at it. Fresh as the day you gave it to me. And you know it's the same one. Amy, believe for twenty minutes.
Stop that nurse.
The sun's going out, and you're photographing a man and a dog. Why?
Man and dog. Why?
Man and dog. Why? Tell me now.
In a hospital, in a coma.
Knew it. Multiform, you see? Disguise itself as anything, but it needs a life feed. A psychic link with a living but dormant mind.
Prisoner Zero.
See, that ship up there is scanning this area for non-terrestrial technology. And nothing says non-terrestrial like a sonic screwdriver.
I think someone's going to notice, don't you?
No, no! No, don't do that!
No, come back. He's here! Come back! He's here. Prisoner Zero is here. Come back, he's here! Prisoner Zero is
Well, of course it did.
It's hiding in human form. We need to drive it into the open. No Tardis, no screwdriver, seventeen minutes. Come on, think. Think!
Multiforms can live for millennia. Twelve years is a pit-stop.
They're looking for him, but they followed me. They saw me through the crack, got a fix, they're only late because I am.
Nurse boy, give me your phone.
Phone. Now. Give me.
These photos, they're are all coma patients?
No, they're all the multiform. Eight comas, eight disguises for Prisoner Zero.
Well, the coma patient dreams he's walking a dog, Prisoner Zero gets a dog. Laptop! Your friend, what was his name? Not him, the good-looking one.
He had a laptop in his bag. A laptop. Big bag, big laptop. I need Jeff's laptop. You two, get to the hospital. Get everyone out of that ward. Clear the whole floor. Phone me when you're done.
Hello. Laptop. Give me.
It's fine. Give it here.
Blimey. Get a girlfriend, Jeff.
The sun's gone wibbly, so right now, somewhere out there, there's going to be a big old video conference call. All the experts in the world panicking at once, and do you know what they need? Me. Ah, and here they all are. All the big boys. NASA, Jodrell Bank, Tokyo Space Centre, Patrick Moore.
I'll get you his number. But watch him, he's a devil.
Can't I?
Hello. Yeah, I know you should switch me off, but before you do, watch this.
Fermat's Theorem, the proof. And I mean the real one. Never been seen before. Poor old Fermat, got killed in a duel before he could write it down. My fault. I slept in. Oh, and here's an oldie but a goodie. Why electrons have mass. And a personal favourite of mine, faster than light travel with two diagrams and a joke. Look at your screens. Whoever I am, I'm a genius. Look at the sun. You need all the help you can get. Fellas, pay attention.
I'm writing a computer virus. Very clever, super fast, and a tiny bit alive, but don't let on. And why am I writing it on a phone? Never mind, you'll find out. Okay, I'm sending this to all your computers. Get everyone who works for you sending this everywhere. Email, text, Facebook, Bebo, Twitter, radar dish, whatever you've got. Any questions?
Patrick, behave.
It's a reset command, that's all. It resets counters. It gets in the wifi and resets every counter it can find. Clocks, calendars, anything with a chip will default at zero at exactly the same time. But yeah, I could be lying, why should you trust me? I'll let my best man explain. (sotto) Jeff, you're my best man.
Listen to me. In ten minutes, you're going to be a legend. In ten minutes, everyone on that screen is going to be offering you any job you want. But first, you have to be magnificent. You have to make them trust you and get them working. This is it, Jeff, right here, right now. This is when you fly. Today's the day you save the world.
It's your bedroom. Now go, go, go.
Oh, and delete your internet history.
Don't worry, I've commandeered a vehicle.
Are you in?
You need to get out of there.
Amy? Amy, what's happening?
Amy, talk to me!
Which window are you?
Which window?
Right! Hello. Am I late? No, three minutes to go. So still time.
Take the disguise off. They'll find you in a heartbeat. Nobody dies.
Okay. You came to this world by opening a crack in space and time. Do it again. Just leave.
DOCTOR; Somebody did.
And we're off! Look at that. Look at that!
DOCTOR; Yeah, I know, just a clock. Whatever. But do you know what's happening right now? In one little bedroom, my team are working. Jeff and the world. And do you know what they're doing? They're spreading the word all over the world, quantum fast. The word is out. And do you know what the word is? The word is Zero. Now, me, if I was up in the sky in a battleship, monitoring all Earth communications, I'd probably take that as a hint. And if I had a whole battle fleet surrounding the planet, I'd be able track a simple old computer virus to its source in, what, under a minute? The source, by the way, is right here.
Oh! And I think they just found us!
Yeah, but this is the good bit. I mean, this is my favourite bit. Do you know what this phone is full of? Pictures of you. Every form you've learned to take, right here. Ooo, and being uploaded about now. And the final score is, no Tardis, no screwdriver, two minutes to spare. Who da man? Oh, I'm never saying that again. Fine.
Oh, stop it. You know you can't. It takes months to form that kind of psychic link.
No! Amy? You've got to hold on. Amy? Don't sleep! You've got to stay awake, please.
Well, that's rubbish. Who's that supposed to be?
DOCTOR; Me? Is that what I look like?
Busy day. Why me, though? You're linked with her. Why are you copying me?
No, she's dreaming about me because she can hear me. Amy, don't just hear me, listen. Remember the room, the room in your house you couldn't see. Remember you went inside. I tried to stop, but you did. You went in the room. You went inside. Amy, dream about what you saw.
Well done, Prisoner Zero. A perfect impersonation of yourself.
No, I didn't.
Tracking the signal back. Sorry in advance.
The bill.
Oi, I didn't say you could go! Article fifty seven of the Shadow Proclamation. This is a fully established level five planet, and you were going to burn it? What? Did you think no-one was watching? You lot, back here, now. Okay, now I've done it.
The roof. No, hang on.
I'm saving the world - I need a decent shirt. To hell with the raggedy. Time to put on a show.
Turn your back if it embarrasses you.
Leaving is good. Never coming back is better. Come on, then! The Doctor will see you now.
No, but I've put a lot of work into it.
Oh, hmm, I don't know. What do you think?
Important? What's that mean, important? Six billion people live here. Is that important? Here's a better question. Is this world a threat to the Atraxi? Well, come on. You're monitoring the whole planet. Is this world a threat?
Are the peoples of this world guilty of any crime by the laws of the Atraxi?
Okay. One more. Just one. Is this world protected? Because you're not the first lot to come here. Oh, there have been so many.
And what you've got to ask is, what happened to them?
Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically, run.
Okay, what have you got for me this time?
Look at you. Oh, you sexy thing! Look at you.
Sorry about running off earlier. Brand new Tardis. Bit exciting. Just had a quick hop to the moon and back to run her in. She's ready for the big stuff now.
Course I came back. I always come back. Something wrong with that?
Well, I just saved the world. The whole planet, for about the millionth time, no charge. Yeah, shoot me. I kept the clothes.
Yeah, it's cool. Bow ties are cool.
Yeah.
So what do you think?
Other planets. Want to check some out?
It means. Well, it means come with me.
Wherever you like.
Oh, don't worry, that's just the beginning. There's loads more.
Oh.! Oops.
So that's
Fourteen years since fish custard. Amy Pond, the girl who waited, you've waited long enough.
Yeah. Not sure where it's got to now. It'll turn up. So, coming?
You wanted to come fourteen years ago.
Don't worry. I'll soon fix that.
Well? Anything you want to say? Any passing remarks? I've heard them all.
Oh, don't worry. Plenty of clothes in the wardrobe. And possibly a swimming pool. So, all of time and space, everything that ever happened or ever will Where do you want to start?
Yeah, I am.
Cause you're the Scottish girl in the English village, and I know how that feels.
All these years living here, most of your life, and you've still got that accent. Yeah, you're coming.
It's a time machine. I can get you back five minutes ago. Why, what's tomorrow?
All right, then. Back in time for stuff.
Oh! A new one! Lovely. Thanks, dear.
Why not?
I don't know. Fun. Do I have to have a reason?
Do I look like people?
Been knocking around on my own for a while. My choice, but I've started talking to myself all the time. It's giving me earache.
Just that. Promise.
So, are you okay, then? Because this place, sometimes it can make people feel a bit, you know.
Amy Pond, there's something you'd better understand about me, because it's important, and one day your life may depend on it. I am definitely a madman with a box. Ha ha! Yeah. Goodbye Leadworth, hello everything.

You there, boy. What day is this?
What year?
Oi. Just answer the question.
Right. Nice year. Bit dull.
Who, me?
Don't worry, don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here? (The large double doors in the wall move and something snarls behind it.)
Ooo. Okay, I've got it. Whatever's behind that door, I think you should get out of here.
No, no. I'm standing right here. Hello.
I'm the Doctor.
Right then. Don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here then?
Hold on, hold on. Who are you?
I'm the Doctor. Simply, the Doctor. The one, the only and the best. Rosita, give me the sonic screwdriver.
The what?
Now quickly, get back to the Tardis.
Back to the what?
If you could stand back, sir. This is a job for a Time Lord.
Job for a what lord?
Oh, that's different.
Oh, that's new.
I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight. Now step back, sir.
Some sort of primitive conversion, like they took the brain of a cat or a dog.
Well, talking's all very well. Rosita?
Now, watch and learn.
Excellent. Now then, let's pull this timorous beastie down to earth.
Or not.
I might be in a little bit of trouble.
Nothing changes. I've got you.
Perhaps if you could pull?
I am pulling. In this position, I couldn't not pull, could I?
Then I suggest you let go, sir.
I'm not letting you out of my sight, Doctor. Don't you recognise me?
No, should I? Have we met? This is hardly the right time for me to go through my social calendar. Argh!
Whoa!
It's going to jump!
We're goanna fall!
But evidently we did not. Oh, I should introduce Rosita. My faithful companion. Always telling me off.
Well, they do, don't they? Rosita. Good name. Hello, Rosita.
Funeral?
Oh, long story. Not my own, not yet. Oh, I'm not as young as I was.
Well, not as young as you were when you were me.
When I was who?
You really don't recognise me?
Not at all.
But you're the Doctor. The next Doctor. Or the next but one. A future Doctor anyway. No, no, don't tell me how it happened. Although, I hope I don't just trip over a brick. That'd be embarrassing. Then again, painless. Worse ways to go. Depends on the brick.
You're gabbling, sir. Now might I ask, who are you, exactly?
No, I'm, er, I'm just. Smith. John Smith. But I've heard all about you, Doctor. Bit of a legend, if I say so myself.
Modesty forbids me to agree with you, sir. But yes. Yes, I am.
A legend with certain memories missing. Am I right?
How do you know that?
You've forgotten me.
Great swathes of my life have been stolen away. When I turn my mind to the past, there's nothing.
Going how far back?
Since the Cybermen. Masters of that hellish wall-scuttler and old enemies of mine, now at work in London town. You won't believe this, Mister Smith, but they are creatures from another world.
Really. Wow.
It's said they fell onto London, out of the sky in a blaze of light. And they found me. Something was taken. And something was lost. What was I like, in the past?
I don't think I should say. Sorry. Got to be careful with memory loss. One wrong word
It's strange, though. I talk of Cybermen from the stars and you don't blink, Mister Smith.
Ah, don't blink. Remember that? Whatever you do, don't blink? The blinking and the statues? Sally and the angels? No?
You're a very odd man.
Hmm, I still am. Something's wrong here.
Oh, the funeral! The funeral's at two o'clock. It's been a pleasure, Mister Smith. Don't breathe a word of it.
Oh, but can't I come with you?
It's far dangerous. Rest assured, I shall keep this city safe. Oh, and, er merry Christmas, Mister Smith.
Merry Christmas, Doctor.
I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight. Now step back, sir.
The late Reverend Fairchild, leaving his place of residence for the last time. God rest his soul. Now, with the house empty, I shall effect an entrance at the rear while you go back to the Tardis. This is hardly work for a woman.
The Doctor's companion does what The Doctor says. Off you go.
Hello.
How did you get in?
Oh, front door. I'm good at doors. Er, do you mind my asking, is that your sonic screwdriver?
Yes. I'd be lost without it.
But that's a screwdriver. How's it sonic?
Well, er, it makes a noise. That's sonic, isn't it? Now, since we're acting like common burglars, I suggest we get out of plain view.
This investigation of yours, what's it about?
It started with a murder.
Oh, good. I mean bad, but whose?
Mr Jackson Lake, a teacher of mathematics from Sussex. He came to London three weeks ago and died a terrible death.
Cybermen?
It's hard to say. His body was never found. But then it started. More secret murders, then abductions. Children, stolen away in silence.
So whose house is this?
The latest murder. The Reverend Aubrey Fairchild, found with burns to his forehead, like some advanced form of electrocution.
But who was he? Was he important?
You ask a lot of questions.
I'm your companion.
The Reverend was the pillar of the community, a member of many parish boards. A keen advocate of children's charities.
Children again. But why would the Cybermen want him dead? And what's his connection to the first death, this Jackson Lake?
It's funny. I seem to be telling you everything, as though you engendered some sort of trust. You seem familiar, Mister Smith. I know your face. But how?
I wonder. I can't help noticing you're wearing a fob watch.
Is that important?
Legend has it that the memories of a Time Lord can be contained within a watch. Do you mind?
It's said that if it's opened
Oh. Maybe not.
It was more for decoration.
Yeah. Anyway, alien infiltration.
Yes. Just look for anything different. Possibly metal. Anything that doesn't seem to belong. Perhaps a mechanical device that could fit no earthly engine.
It could even seem to be organic, but unlike any organism of the natural world. Shush! What's that noise?
Oh, it's just me, whistling. I wonder what's in here, though.
Ah. Different and metal, you were right.
They are infostamps. I mean, at a guess. If I were you, I'd say they worked something like this.
See? Compressed information. Tons of it. That is the history of London, 1066 to the present day. This is like a disc, a Cyberdisc. But why would the Cybermen need something so simple? They've got to be wireless. Unless, they're in the wrong century. They haven't got much power. They need plain old basic infostamps to update themselves. Are you all right?
I'm fine.
No, what is it? What's wrong?
I've seen one of these before. I was holding this device the night I lost my mind. The night I regenerated. The Cybermen, they made me change. My mind, my face, my whole self. And you were there. Who are you?
A friend. I swear.
Then I beg you, John. Help me.
Ah. Two words I never refuse. But it's not a conversation for a dead man's house. It'll make more sense if we go back to the Tardis. Your Tardis. Hold on. I just need to do a little final check. Won't take a tick. There's one more thing I cannot figure. If this room's got infostamps, then maybe, just maybe, it's got something that needs infostamping.
Okay.
I think we should run.
Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor!
Stairs! Can't lead them outside!
I'm a dab hand with a cutlass. You don't want to come near me when I've got one of these. This is your last warning. No? Olay, this is really your last warning! Okay, I give up.
Listen to me properly. Whatever you're doing stuck in 1851, I can help! I mean it. I'm the only person in the world who can help you! Listen to me!
I'm the Doctor. You need me. Check your memory banks. My name's the Doctor. Leave this man alone. The Doctor is me!
The Doctor, remember? I'm the Doctor! You need me alive. You need the Doctor, and that's me!
Infostamp with a Cyclo-Steinham core. You ripped open the core and broke the safety. Zap! Only the Doctor would think of that.
I did that last time.
Come here. You'll be okay. Let me just check.
You told them you were the Doctor. Why did you do that?
Oh, I was just protecting you.
You're trying to take away the only thing I've got, like they did. They stole something, something so precious, but I can't remember. What happened to me? What did they do?
We'll find out. You and me together.
Now then, Rosita. A little decorum.
What about the Tardis?
I'm looking forward to this.
DOCTOR; You were right though, Rosita. The Reverend Fairchild's death was the work of the Cybermen.
So, you live here?
A temporary base, until we rout the enemy. The Tardis is magnificent, but it's hardly a home.
And where's the Tardis now?
In the yard.
Er, what's all this luggage?
Evidence. The property of Jackson Lake, the first man to be murdered. Oh, but my new friend is a fighter, Rosita, much like myself. He faced the Cybermen with a cutlass. I'm not ashamed to say, he was braver than I. He was quite brilliant.
Are you whistling again?
Yes. Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah.
Well, a dead man's.
How did you two meet, then?
Come now, Rosita. With all the things a Time Lord has seen, everything he's lost, he may surely have bad dreams.
Yeah. Oh, now. Look. Jackson Lake had an infostamp.
But how? Is that significant?
Doctor, the answer to all this is in your Tardis. Can I see it?
Mister Smith, it would be my honour.
There she is. My transport through time and space. The Tardis.
You've got a balloon.
Tardis. T A R D I S. It stands for Tethered Aerial Release Developed In Style. Do you see?
Well, I do now. I like it. Good Tardis. Brilliant. Nice one. And is it inflated by gas, yeah?
We're adjacent to the Mutton Street Gasworks. I pay them a modest fee. Good work, Jed.
You've got quite a bit of money.
Oh, you get nothing for nothing. How's that ripped panel, Jed?
Not just yet, I think. One day, I will ascend. One day soon.
You've never actually been up?
I can depart in the Tardis once London is safe. And finally, when I'm up there. Think of it, John. The time and the space.
The perfect escape. Do you ever wonder what you're escaping from?
With every moment.
Then do you want me to tell you? Because I think I've worked it out now. How you became The Doctor. What do you think? Do you want to know?
The story begins with the Cybermen. A long time away, and not so far from here, the Cybermen were fought, and they were beaten. And they were sent into a howling wilderness called The Void, locked inside forever more. But then a greater battle rose up, so great that everything inside the Void perished. But, as the walls of the world weakened, the last of the Cybermen must have fallen through the dimensions, back in time, to land here. And they found you.
I fought them, I know that. But what happened?
At the same time, another man came to London. Mister Jackson Lake. Plenty of luggage, money in his pocket. Maybe coming to town for the winter season, I don't know. But he found the Cybermen too. And just like you, exactly like you, he took hold of an infostamp.
But he's dead. Jackson Lake is dead. The Cybermen murdered him.
You said no body was ever found. And you kept all his suitcases, but you could never bring yourself to open them. I told you the answer was in the fob watch. Can I see?
J L. The watch is Jackson Lake's.
You became the Doctor because the infostamp you picked up was a book about one particular man.
The Cybermen's database. Stolen from the Daleks inside the Void, I'd say, but it's everything you could want to know about the Doctor.
Time Lord, Tardis, enemy of the Cybermen. The one and the only. You see, the infostamp must have backfired. Streamed all that information about me right inside your head.
No, no, no, no, no. Infostamps are just facts and figures. All that bravery. Saving Rosita, defending London town, hmm? And the invention. Building a Tardis. That's all you.
There's still something missing, isn't there?
Sorry. Really, I am so sorry, but that's an awful lot of luggage for one man. Because an infostamp is plain technology. It's not enough to make a man lose his mind. What you suffered is called a fugue. A fugue state, where the mind just runs away because it can't bear to look back. You wanted to become someone else, because Jackson Lake had lost so much.
Oh, you found a whole cache of infostamps.
Activation. A call to arms. The Cybermen are moving!
Oh, nothing as holy as that.
Can you hear me? Hello? No? Mister Cole, you seem to have something in your ear. Now, this might hurt a bit, but if I can just
Ah. They're on guard. Can't risk a fight. Not with the children.
Where's that?
But what for?
Yeah, that's too well guarded. We'll have to find another way in.
Whoa! That's cheating, sneaking up. Do you have your legs on silent?
Listen. Just walk towards me slowly. Don't let them touch you.
Even if they've converted you, that's not a Cyber speech pattern. You've still got free will. I'm telling you, step away.
I'm the Doctor.
Yeah, but that's because your database got corrupted. Oh, look, look, look. Check this. The Doctor's infostamp.
Plug it in. Go on. Download.
Oh, well. Nice try.
Hello.
No, no. Oh, but let me die happy. Tell me, what do you need those children for?
But for what?
And it's all been timed for Christmas Day. Was that your idea, Miss ?
The birth of what?
Run! Come on!
Can I say, I completely disapprove. Come on.
That stronghold down by the river. I need to find a way in.
That might be our way in. Brilliant.
Maybe you should go back
It must've been guarding this. A Dimension Vault. Stolen from the Daleks again. That's how the Cybermen travelled through time. Jackson, is this it? The thing you couldn't remember?
Not enough power. Come on! Avanti!
They want us. That's what Cybermen are. Human beings with their brains put into metal shells. They want every living thing to be like them.
It's an engine. They're generating electricity, but what for?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Power at ninety percent. But if we stop the engine, the power dies down, the Cybermen'll come running. Ooo. Hold on. Power fluctuation. That's not meant to happen.
No, it's weird. The software's rewriting itself. It's changing.
Whoa! What the hell's happening? It's out of control.
They're disposable. Come on!
Right. Now, all of you, out! Do you hear me? That's an order! Every single one of you, run!
There's a hot pie for everyone, if you leg it!
Rosita, get them out of sluice gate. Once you're out, keep running. Far as you can! Come on, come on, come on.
Go! Quick, quick. It's some sort of starter motor, but starting what?
What?
Come on!
They've finished with the motor. It's going to blow up.
Come on, Jackson. You know me.
Oh, that's it. Hello. Now, hold on tight. Don't let go.
Merry Christmas.
Head for the street.
Gotcha!
It's a CyberKing.
It's a ship. Dreadnought class. Front line of an invasion. And inside the chest, a Cyberfactory, ready to convert millions.
Just head south. Take him south. Go to the parkland.
To stop that thing.
Jackson, you've got your son. You've got a reason to live.
Oh, good man. Jed, wasn't it? Jed, I need your help!
I'll give you five pound notes.
The Tardis is going to fly.
It's been said before. Now give me.
Not enough power. Come on! Jed, let her loose.
Nope, never.
Oh, get on with it.
Miss Hartigan? I'm offering you a choice. You might have the most remarkable mind this world has ever seen. Strong enough to control the Cybermen themselves.
No, but such a mind deserves to live. The Cybermen came to this world using a Dimension vault. I can use that device to find you a home, with no people to convert, but a new world where you can live out your mechanical life in peace.
Because if you don't, I'll have to stop you.
No. The question is, what do you make of me?
You make me into this.
I wasn't trying to kill you. All I did was break the Cyber-connection, leaving your mind open. Open, I think, for the first time in far too many years. So you can see. Just look at yourself. Look at what you've done.
I'm sorry, Miss Hartigan, but look at what you've become.
I'm so sorry.
Ooo, now you're ready.
Yeah. Funny that.
Now, take care of that one. She's marvellous.
Like I said, you know me.
Oh, be my guest.
Well, that's one word for it.
Onwards and upwards.
No.
They leave. Because they should. Or they find someone else. And some of them, some of them forget me. I suppose in the end, they break my heart.
Oh, go on then.
Just this once. You've actually gone and changed my mind. Not many people can do that. Jackson, if anyone had to be the Doctor, I'm glad it was you.
I certainly will. Merry Christmas to you, Jackson.

(sotto) Listen!
Question. Why do we talk out loud when we know we're alone? (blows out candle) Conjecture. Because we know we're not.
Evolution perfects survival skills. There are perfect hunters.
There is perfect defence.
Question. Why is there no such thing as perfect hiding? Answer. How would you know? Logically, if evolution were to perfect a creature whose primary skill were to hide from view, how could you know it existed?
It could be with us every second and we would never know. How would you detect it, even sense it, except in those moments when, for no clear reason you choose to speak aloud? What would such a creature want? What would it do? Well? What would you do?
You just have to squeeze through.
Why do you have three mirrors? Why don't you just turn your head?
You said you had a date. I thought I'd better hide in the bedroom in case you brought him home. Bit early, aren't you? Did it all go wrong, or is this good by your standards?
Fine. I need you, for a thing.
Oh, of course you can. Come on, you're free. More than usually free, in fact.
From the date guy? It's too late. You've taken your make-up off.
Oh, right. Well, you probably just missed a bit. Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Yes, you know sometimes when you talk to yourself, what if you're not?
What if it's not you you're talking to? Proposition. What if no one is ever really alone? What if every single living being has a companion, a silent passenger, a shadow? What if the prickle on the back of your neck, is the breath of something close behind you?
Perhaps I never have.
Well, I couldn't have written it and forgotten, could I?
Dreams. Accounts of dreams, by different people, all through history. You see, I have a theory.
I think everybody, at some point in their lives, has the exact same nightmare. You wake up, or you think you do, and there's someone in the dark, someone close, or you think there might be.
So you sit up,and turn on the light. And the room looks different at night. It ticks and creaks and breathes. And you tell yourself there's nobody there, nobody watching, nobody listening, nobody there at all. And you very nearly believe it. You really, really try and then.
There are accounts of that dream throughout human history. Time and time again, the same dream. Now, there is a very obvious question I'm about to ask you. Do you know what it is?
Exactly.
I asked first.
You really didn't.
Why?
Just hold on tight. If anything bites, let it.
Tardis telepathic interface. You are now in mental contact with the Tardis, so don't think anything rude.
It might end up on all of the screens. The Tardis is extrapolating your entire timeline, from the moment of your birth, to the moment of your death.
I'm turning off the safeguards and navigation, slaving the Tardis to you. Focus on the dream. Focus on the details. Picture them, feel them. The Tardis will track on your subconscious and extract the relevant information. It should be able to home in on the moment in your timeline when you first had that dream. And then, we'll see.
What's under your bed.
Okay, now don't get distracted. Remember, you are flying a time machine.
No, no. Don't you dare. No, don't. Don't, don't. Just ignore it.
Okay, that's good. That worked. We're here.
No, no, no, no, no. The date's fine. Come on.
Your childhood.
The West Country Children's Home. Gloucester. By the ozone level and the drains, mid-nineties. You must have been here when you had the dream.
You've probably just forgotten. Have you seen the size of human brains? They're hilarious. Little you must be in here somewhere, with your little brain.
It is potentially catastrophic.
I was still talking. I needed someone to nod. Probably best for you to wait in the Tardis.
See you in a minute. Tardis.
We would probably have ended up in the wrong place. But don't think we have, because the time zone's right. I won't be long.
Your door must be faulty.
When better? Do you always work here nights?
Do you ever end up talking to yourself?
What about your coffee?
Sometimes, do you put it down, and look round, and it's not there?
Yes. Everybody.
Who turned your telly off?
Hmm.
Where is he?
I can't find him. Can you find him?
Wally.
He's nowhere in this book.
Well, how would you know? Maybe you just haven't found him yet.
Really? Well, that's a few years of my life I'll be needing back. Are you scared? The thing on the bed, whatever it is, look at it. Does it scare you?
Well, that's good. Want to know why that's good?
Let me tell you about scared. Your heart is beating so hard, I can feel it through your hands. There's so much blood and oxygen pumping through your brain, it's like rocket fuel. Right now, you could run faster and you could fight harder, you could jump higher than ever in your life. And you are so alert, it's like you can slow down time. What's wrong with scared? Scared is a superpower. It's your superpower. There is danger in this room and guess what? It's you. Do you feel it?Do you think he feels it? Do you think he's scared? Nah. Loser. Turn your back on him.
Yeah, turn your back on him. Come on. You too, Clara. Clara, your back, now.
Do it. Just do it now. Turn your back. Do it now, turn your back. Lovely view out this window.
The deep and lovely dark. We'd never see the stars without it. Now, there are two possibilities. Possibility one, it's just one of your friends standing there, and he's playing a joke on you. Possibility two, it isn't.
You on the bed, I'm talking to you now. Go in peace. We won't look. Just go. If all you want to do is stay hidden, it's okay. Just leave.
Don't look round. Not yet.
Don't look round.
Look away! Look away now! Don't look at it! Don't look round. Don't look round. Don't look at the reflection.
Imagine a thing that must never be seen. What would it do if you saw it?
Neither do I. Close your eyes.
Close your eyes. You too, Clara. Give it what it wants. Prove to it that you're not going to look at it. Make a promise. A promise you're never going to look at it.
The breath on the back of your neck, like your hair's standing on end. That means, don't look round.
Gone.
Oh, the human race. You're never happy, are you?
Nobody's safe, especially not at night in the dark, Anything can get you. And all the way up here, you're up here all alone.
What was that for?
People don't need to be lied to.
Plastic army.
Once upon a time.
The end. Dad skills.
Entirely possible, yes. The bigger question is, why did we end up with him, and not you?
But why that particular boy? You don't have any. You don't have any kind of connection with him, do you?
The Tardis was slaved to your timeline. Theoretically, there should have been some connection.
Scrambled his memory. Gave him a big old dream about being Dan the soldier man.
Are you okay?
It's fine.
Really?
Ah, Clara! Well done, you found her. Now this is really a bit strange.
What's gone wrong with your face? It's all eyes! Why are you all eyes? Get them under control.
This is Colonel Orson Pink, from about a hundred years in your future.
Yeah, I laughed too. Sorry. Do you have any connection with him?
Yes, maybe you're like a distant relative or something?
Right. Okay. (to Orson) Er, well, do you have any old family photographs of her? You know, probably quite old and really fat-looking?
Well, you left a trace in the Tardis telepathic circuits. I fired them up again and the Tardis brought me straight to him. So he is something to do with your timeline.
And you'll never guess where I found him.
The end of the road. This is it, the end of everything. The last planet.
The Tardis isn't supposed to come this far, but some idiot turned the safeguards off. Listen.
Nothing. There's nothing to hear. There's nothing anywhere. Not a breath, not a slither, not a click or a tick. All the clocks have stopped. This is the silence at the end of time.
Pioneer time traveller.
Rode the first of the great time shots. They were supposed to fire him into the middle of the next week.
He went a bit far.
A big bit. Look at him now. Robinson Crusoe at the end of time itself. The last man standing in the universe. I always thought that would be me.
I know it's not a competition. Course it isn't. Still time, though.
He's been stranded for six months, just met a time traveller. Of course he's packing.
I just showed you, didn't I? A test flight to a restaurant.
Easy. I can do that, can't I, Clara?
Is she doing theall eyes thing? It's because her face is so wide. She needs three mirrors.
We can't leave immediately, though. The Tardis needs to recharge.
Overnight, that should do it, shouldn't it, Clara?
One more night. That's, that's not a problem, is it?
It's a shame, isn't it?
There's only three people left in the universe, and you're lying to the other two. It was the first thing I noticed when I stepped in here. You must have seen it, too, Clara. You've got eyes out to here.
The universe is dead. Everything that ever was is dead and gone. There's nothing beyond this door but nothingness for ever. So why is it locked?
Afraid of the dark? But the dark is empty now.
Waiting.
That's one way of looking at it.
That's a hell of a lot of ghosts.
It's always been there. It's only visible in the night lights.
Colonel Pink. Apparently, at night, he needs a reminder. Six months stranded alone, I suppose it must be tempting.
Company.
What kind of explanation would you like?
Well, the systems are switching to low power. There are temperature differentials all over this ship. It's like pipes banging when the heating goes off.
Me, too. Who were you having dinner with?
I thought that I would give it a try.
Serious?
A serious date?
Well, I would like to know about his prospects. If you like, I can pop ahead and check them out.
Atmospheric pressure equalising
Company.
Because I need to know.
Suppose that there are creatures that live to hide. That only show themselves to the very young or the very old, or the mad, or anyone who wouldn't be believed.
What would those creatures do when everyone was gone? When there was only one man left standing in the universe?
Potentially, the hull cooling.
Believably.
Someone knocking.
Yes.
What's that in the mirror, or the corner of your eye? What's that footstep following, but never passing by?
No. Get in the Tardis.
I have to know.
The Tardis, now!
It's a pressure lock. Releasing it could've triggered the opening mechanism.
There is an air shell round the ship. Why are you still here?
Then you will never travel with me again, because that is the deal! Tardis, now! Do as you are told!
I know.
Perhaps they're all just waiting, perhaps when we're all dead, out they'll come a-slithering from underneath the bed.
Sontarans! Perverting the course of human history!

Clara! Clara!
Where are we? Have we moved? Where have we landed?
Why?
I don't take orders, Clara.
No, no. Not the hugging. No, no, no. I'm against the hugging. Please.

Oh, I've got the most ghastly toothache. It's paralysing pain.
No, my dear, thank you, no. I shall have to have it out. We've got to find a dentist.
Yes, you're very observant, dear boy, but where?
Well, use your eyes, dear boy. Good heavens.
Why not? Fat chance I've got of finding a dentist in the middle West part of
Oh please, must you?
Yes, yes, yes.
What about my tooth!
Oh, good gracious. Absolutely absurd.
Why you have to dress yourselves up like
Oh, that hat is certainly wrong with it.
For me, my dear child? Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, thank you. Yes, at least it'll keep the rain off. Yes, it's most suitable. Ow!
What was that?
Oh, do be careful, dear boy. And remember that belongs to my favourite collection!
Oh, what on Earth? Are you? And who might you be, sir?
I don't know who you are or what right you have
Oh, quite, quite so. Allow me, sir, to introduce Miss Dodo Dupont, wizard of the ivory keys, and er Steven Regret, tenor. And lastly sir, your humble servant Doctor Caligari.
Yes, quite right. I've just been satisfying the Sheriff here that we are a humble troupe of travelling players. Unfortunately, sir, at the moment between engagements. MASTERSON: Well if I was you I'd keep a-travellin'. There ain't no theatre in Tombstone.
Oh, is that so? Oh, well, that's no matter, no. You see my prime purpose for visiting your city, sir, was to avail myself the services of a dentist.
Yes.
Oh, I'm vastly obliged to you, Sheriff. Come, fellow thespians! No doubt I shall be very glad to see you, meet you later on, Mister, Mister Werp.
Oh, my dear young man, can't you sing a little?
Well, I had to find some sort of suitable cover. After all, you can't walk into the middle of a Western town and say that you've come from outer space. Good gracious me, we'd all be arrested on a vagrancy charge.
There will be no necessity to have a bash, because tomorrow morning we're going to leave Tombstone and we should be back in the Tardis in for lunch. You know, I don't think that that is a very subtle form of advertising, do you? Yes, come to think of it, my dear, you know I think my toothache's better. Yes, I don't think it's going to be at all necessary
Oh, I only wish I shared your confidence, my dear. However, I suppose I'll meet you both back in the hotel lounge. Oh! There it goes again.
I, er, forgive me, sir. I, er, I should have knocked.
Yes, well, er, the fact is I, er, I, have a toothache.
Oh, I see. Well, under the circumstances I think perhaps, er, yes, excuse me.
Well, as a matter of fact, my dear sir
Well, I think it's at the back here somewhere.
Oh, just a minute, please. Haven't you any anaesthetic?
Well er, something to sort of dull the pain, man.
Good gracious, certainly not!
Oh, my dear man, I never touch alcohol.
Well, I must say, this is most unprofessional. I do hope you know what you're doing.
I don't care what you do with it, my good man, only get it out of my sight.
What do I owe you?
Oh! Good thing I didn't have to have my tonsils out.
What? Yes, yes, what is it?
Holiday? Yes, I suppose so. Yes, you could call it that.
Oh, well, I'm very glad to know you Mister Harper. Yes, I suppose you've brought a message from my friends.
Oh, well, that's very sociable of them, but unfortunately I don't touch alcohol.
That's a very charming man, that man Mister Harper. Did you hear what he said?
Oh, my dear man, I fail to see that my clothes have
Well, what is it then?
Well, I should hope not. I certainly disapprove of violence.
No, no, no, no, no.
I insist.
Thank you, thank you. I don't know how I shall ever repay you.
What?
Oh, yes, indeed, yes. thank you. And the same to you and many of them. Yes, thank you. Goodbye for the moment.
Well played, Steven, my boy. Well played. Yes, and you too, my dear. Excellent. I'd really no idea.
Oh, you flatter me, young man. Yes, reasonably accomplished I would say, but not great.
Oh, really? Why? Oh, yes, of course. We met a little while ago down at the dentist. Yes, and you so very kindly invited me to join you and your friends for a drink!
Yes, quite so, quite so. Well, I'm afraid I don't touch alcohol, but a little glass of milk and I should be only too delighted. Won't you, er, introduce me?
The Clanton brothers. Oh dear. I mean, er, how d'you do?
Oh yes I do, indeed, yes. Steven, don't you think it's time we were going?
Oh yes, I know. Yes, sometimes after a bereavement it's very difficult to find exactly the right kind of words.
Oh indeed. Yes, yes, yes. Well, if you take my advice, I would leave it in the hands of the right people.
Er, he's not my friend, no. I would rather call him a casual travelling acquaintance.
Wait a moment. I think I can begin to see your mistake.
But I am not the Doc. The man you're looking for is the local dentist. Yes! He has a little shop here, along the street.
Yes, well, I can explain that. You see
Er, well, yes, as a matter of fact he lent it to me because er, because er
Er, well, just until I leave the town, as it were.
Excuse me, gentlemen, gentlemen, you must have made a horrible mistake. Steven, my boy
Yes, I'm sorry, gentleman, but this is Holliday's young girlfriend, and she's only lying to protect him. Now, as I've already told you about this gun.
Between the who?
Oh, my dear young lady, I, I, I, I
Yes, yes, quite so, quite so. Very good idea. Excellent. Well, you heard. Steven, get their guns!
How do we proceed?
Yes, excellent idea. Well, gentlemen you will move over in an orderly fashion. You too.
I keep telling you I'm not Holliday. Well, what do we do now?
Indeed, indeed, And may I point out that I still have the chance, sir?
Exactly! That's the whole point isn't it?
My dear Marshall, I'm so glad to see you. You know, I was trying to explain to them
Well!
Under arrest? And don't you call me pop. You know very well who I am, sir!
I want to see my solicitor.
Oh, very well, but I promise you, you will regret this, sir.
I have already told you, my dear Sheriff. He lent it to me.
Yes, a most unscrupulous man.
Ah, but I insist on coming with you.
Hmm?
Oh, Steven, my boy. Good gracious. I've been so worried about you. How's Dodo?
What on Earth for?
Yes, but my dear boy, I
But Steven! Oh, confound the boy.
Ten minutes.
Ten minutes. Mister Werp? Oh, er, Mister Werp. I say, can you do that?
I have no intention of trying anything, only people keep giving me guns and do I wish they wouldn't. I wonder, would you mind looking after it for me?
Oh er, that young friend of mine, you know, Steven. A rather impetuous sort of lad. He said to meet him outside in ten minutes time.
Oh yes I wish you would. And would you kindly explain to him that I'm quite happy where I am for the moment?
About now, Marshall.
What?
Good gracious! And Steven's with them!
I really think I must go out there.
But I might be able to convince them that I'm not Doc Holliday! I can't just sit here and allow them to hang Steven!
But what can I do?
Oh, this is insufferable.
Very well, under protest.
Oh, dear, dear. What on Earth is Mister Werp doing? He's leaving things too late!
He's no right to take chances with Steven's life! Those men mean what they say.
He's not risking his neck. Now I really must go out there.
Oh, poo.
Was it necessary for Mister Werp to hit him so hard?
We shan't be here to see the outcome. Tomorrow we're leaving. Goodbye Mister Werp.
Yes, Dodo. Well, my boy, presumably she spent the evening in her room.
Of course, of course.
Why, whatever for?
Now don't be ridiculous. Doc Holliday's a great friend of mine. He gave me a gun, he extracted my tooth. Good gracious me, what more do you want? Come along, boy. Come along, come along.
Well, as soon as we've had breakfast, my boy, I must check up with Mister Werp and ask him if he knows where they've all gone.
Er, yes, er, excuse me, sir, but I think under the circumstances you'd better remain here until Mister Werp arrives.
Ah no, no.
Well, we must find him.
You see, a young lady of our acquaintance is with him.
Oh certainly not, sir, certainly not. I mean, we're just going to er, well, er, reason with him.
Do you know who that is?
That's Johnny Ringo.
Yes.
Well, we'd be mighty grateful.
Disgusting habit.
Did I hear the name Doc Holliday mentioned?
Yes, well I've got news of him.
Oh, Dodo you see. I mean, er, Miss Dupont has gone off with him, and young Steven is following up and I've got to wait.
No, no, my dear Marshall, no. He's gone with a young man by the name of Ringo.
Yes, yes. You've got a photograph of him here, look.
Why, is he a friend of the Clanton's?
Yes. There's one more thing. I have to report a murder.
Yes, the barman at the Last Chance. I believe his name is Charlie, isn't it?
Are you going to be all right? (Warren smiles then looks through the bars at Phineas, and chuckles.)
How do you know that the killer was Ringo?
Certainly not, my dear Sheriff.
That was nothing to do with me.
I certainly hope that I should not be here. When Steven and Dodo come back
Well. this is utterly absurd. Nothing will ever induce me to raise a gun in anger.
Howdy. Would you mind not calling me Pop?
Now Mister Werp, what part am I supposed to be playing in this feud between you and the Clantons? I thought that you gave me this to uphold the law, not
My main concern is for the safety of Steven and Dodo. Now can't I ask you to change your mind?
Steven? What in the world?
Well, if he's there it's not a matter of choice. He's still searching for Dodo with Ringo.
Oh, this is sheer madness, Mister Sheriff. You can't take on the Clantons and Ringo.
Oh, my dear, I'm not in the slightest bit of danger. It was you that we were worried about.
But this is ridiculous, gentleman. Can you not uphold the law without using firearms?
Oh, good heavens, what a relief. Here you are, Bat, there's your badge and there is your wretched weapon!
Yes, what is your way, Doctor Holliday?
Oh, how can I possibly sleep my dear, knowing that Steven is mixed up with all this?
Yes, but I'm not just worrying about Steven, my dear. What about this man Mister Werp? Supposing he gets killed? Who is going to uphold law and order in this territory? Why they couldn't let Masterson handle the affair I don't know, with a posse of deputies, and at the end of it let the Clantons get a fair trial.
Me? But my dear Sheriff, I should have thought you were the one to convince
Yes, I see.
Yes, quite so, my dear. That thought had passed through my head, yes. Well, Mister Sheriff, if you need my assistance I certainly will go along and talk to them.
Mister Clanton, I presume?
No, not Doctor at the moment, dear boy. I am Deputy-Sheriff of Tombstone.
I've come along to ask you to call off your boys from embarking on this ridiculous duel.
And if you'll do this I'm sure that Masterson will see that they get a fair trial.
I see. You would prefer them to be shot down in the street?
Ah tut, tut, tut, tut, tut. If you are alluding to the presence of Mister Ringo, I can assure you, sir, that that also has been anticipated. They're quite ready for him.
You have been sadly misinformed. Doctor Holliday is there also.
Why on Earth you want to leave Tombstone, I can't imagine. All the Clantons are dead. Ringo is dead.
It's a very good likeness.
Thank you.
It's a terrible, terrible injustice. You know I'm very tempted to
Oh, my dear Dodo, my dear Dodo. You know you're fast becoming a prey to every clich-ridden convention in the American West. And it's high time we left. Now, come along.
Come along now.
I don't want to discuss it any further. In you go. Come along!
Yes, I think I can say that I know just exactly where we are.
In the future. Very much in the future. We've now reached the distant horizon of an age, an age of peace and prosperity. Now, I'm going to be off.

Ah!
Interesting. It isn't a leak.
No, our power's being tapped somehow.
It's just draining away. I don't understand.
I'm sorry, did you say something?
Oh. Well, er, we'll block the outlet there. For a while we'll just have to run on reduced power.
Quiet. I'm trying to listen to something.
I'm not quite sure. It must have been my imagination.
That's it! Of course, a message. Turn up the power.
Power.
We must increase energy output. Now, push that lever to full.
Of course. Now, keep it at full, whatever happens.
Can you hear me?
We're giving you more power.
Where are you?
We're giving you everything we've got. It is you, isn't it?
I can't hear you.
Keep it going!
Go on.
Quiet! Keep back. Stay in the console room. Nine zero.
What? Not allow what?
Never, ever, disobey my instructions again.
And because of you, many others might die.
The White Guardian.
I've no time to explain. I have to sort out these coordinates.
I don't know. I lost contact before I could get more information.
Prevent something happening, something dangerous.
No, but when the White Guardian says there's danger, he's invariably right.
Time override. Locking must have been in the coordinates. We're here.
Well, I have to find out what's going on. Turlough, get a couple of torches.
No. I need you here.
The White Guardian may try and make contact again.
No, I need someone I can rely on. It's important.
Save the arguing until later.
Operate this lever. His power's badly depleted. He's having to draw on ours to get through at all.
Yes, exactly.
Well, apart from the coordinates, I could understand very little.
No, there may not be time.
Yes, and going out is the only way to learn what it is.
Are you ready?
Thank him politely. Won't be long.
Listen. Rats.
I don't think so. Look at this.
Really? Look again.
We're on a ship. A sailing ship. The hold, probably.
I didn't know you were so keen to find it. Down.
Checking the stores.
Yes, almost as though he were hypnotised. Still, at least he didn't find the Tardis. Come on.
No, it's a door.
You ready?
How do you do?
Not bad.
Gently, Turlough. This one will do for me, you can take that one.
Behaving as if we've just joined the crew. Edwardian England.
So it seems.
First British submarine launched.
They're sizing us up. Fo'c'sle's fairly cramped. It's important to know who you're sharing it with. After all, we could be cooped up here together for months.
Only if we're both here for the trip.
No, I must find out why the White Guardian wanted me to come here.
We stay.
Yes, thanks.
Ah. Turlough, and I'm the Doctor.
You've been expecting me?
The doctor. Of course, the ship's cook.
Er, may I?
Have you been below decks for two days?
How do you do? Did you all come aboard at the same time?
Curious.
Celebrating your last night ashore.
And you're quite sure not one of you can remember coming aboard?
Surely, surely you must find it rather strange that none of you can recall signing on?
You know where the Tardis is if things get difficult.
What are you doing here?
You're unharmed? Did the White Guardian make contact again?
Well, tell me everything you can remember.
Well, is that it?
Well, you did your best.
It may do, especially as we're on a racing yacht.
We've been talking to the crew.
How do you do? I'm the
Please.
Oh, brave heart, Tegan.
You're not going with them?
Hmm.
To find Tegan, if your courage is up to it. She's on the way to the wheelhouse. Don't ask me why she left the Tardis. Did you manage to find out anything about the race?
Yes, when we've found Tegan.
Are you all right?
Maybe this'll tell us where we are.
Oh, they're considerably more than that.
Look at the screen. We're not on a yacht, we're on a ship. A spaceship.
Remarkable, though I think they have their maritime history slightly confused.
Yes. What about the officers?
No, no, it's much more complicated than that. Tegan?
Oh, nonsense, Tegan. The ship's hardly moving.
Now wait a minute.
Yet.
Look at the chart.
If you look closely enough, you'll see it's a solar system containing Earth.
Indeed. Look, leave now. Find where Marriner's taken Tegan.
I want to see what else I can find out here.
Venus.
What are you proposing to do?
All the period detail is impressively accurate.
Everything except that jewel.
That isn't contemporary. Seventeenth century Spanish, isn't it?
The only think out of period. Why?
Why are you doing this?
And the crews for the ships, you collected from their different time zones just as a diversion, too?
Ephemerals?
You had no right to do it. They're real. Living, breathing flesh and blood.
You're reading my thoughts.
And where do you function?
What are you doing?
Do you think that wise? We're coming in too fast.
Come about or you'll crash.
Heave to.
We're running before the wind.
It's some sort of ion drive. It comes to the same thing.
Well, we had a lot of luck.
And winner takes all.
We must stay with it. Remember what the White Guardian said, winner takes all. It has to be the winner of this race.
They're not interested, Tegan.
No.
You saw the way the ship was manoeuvred around Venus. These vessels are built to withstand enormous stress.
Or it was shot down. It seems this race is getting serious. Someone is prepared to kill in order to win.
That we must find out. I think it's time we had a conference.
Not here, Tegan, your cabin. I'll meet you there in a moment.
Then who did it?
Oh, it spoils the fun, you mean. What is against the rules?
You chose this ship.
And the crew?
But why? I mean, it's not just to sail the ships, is it. No, of course not. You need their minds, human minds.
Ephemeral, then. From any planet, any galaxy, any time. The minds of living beings. You depend on them.
And I wonder where you got it from, all your technology. Mind you, if you can pick Earth beings from nineteenth century England, from the Athens of Pericles, from the Ch'in dynasty, I suppose you can just as easily pick the minds of more advanced beings from other galaxies.
Parasites! That's what Eternals are. You feed on living minds, you use them as blueprints.
Oh, absolutely. I do see what you mean. Living minds are contaminated with crude emotions, organic, irrational, creative, entertaining.
You talk as though they were toys.
Then why is one of you taking this race so seriously?
You don't know?
You didn't know, though, just for a second. Interesting.
It's me.
What's the matter?
Yes, well, they can make anything they see in your mind. That's how this ship was made, out of the minds of the crew. Just as this room was.
Hmm.
Oh, no, no, they exist outside of time.
They're eternal. They exist in eternity. It's er, it's not really what you'd call living.
We do. Their minds are empty, used up. They need ideas from us. They're desperate for them.
Yes, not till I find out what's at the end of the race.
I do understand how you feel, but I must ask you to stay. The Tardis is the last thing I want them to find out about.
Well, I wouldn't like to risk it. They do have enormous power.
Try to distract them, give them something to worry about. Even an Eternal can't put his mind to too many things at once. Come on.
All right. Where's Turlough?
Turlough!
What happened?
Are you all right?
Come on. We're taking Tegan back to the Tardis.
Turlough, you wait here.
Is he? You can both wait for me in the Tardis.
Over here.
Well, it was here.
They've found out about the Tardis.
What have you done with the Tardis?
I underestimated you.
What picture?
Where have you taken
Will Jackson be punished?
Superior?
What are you competing for? I mean, the whole point of a race is to win something. What's the prize?
Enlightenment.
Once we've found the Tardis.
Hopefully, Turlough, hopefully.
No!
Don't be an idiot.
Man overboard! Man overboard!
Man overboard. It's Turlough.
Come on!
Yes, she's heaving to.
He's safe. Come on.
To talk to Striker. We must get to that ship.
I don't know, but we must get him back.
It was an impulse. You know how impulsive the young are. No, I don't suppose you do.
We could collect Turlough.
Hurry up, Tegan.
Well, the launch'll be alongside in a moment.
Hmm.
We've been hit.
Well, come along, come along.
Asteroid storm.
Well, they may not choose to use it. Against the rules of the race.
I don't think that worries them.
I don't know, but it's increasing.
We're way ahead of the others. This ship can't help winning.
Especially to anyone who challenges Captain Wrack and the Buccaneer.
Have you forgotten the Greek who challenged Wrack's ship? I wonder if the same thing will happen to us.
Fascinating. A complete cross-section.
Masters of sail, and if they're not, they're Eternals, like your friend Marriner. To them it's just a game to pass the time. I can't see Turlough.
I'd noticed.
She's also an Eternal. Tegan.
But we don't have your remarkable constitutions.
Of course.
Is she?
Is it. Look, I need to find Turlough. Can you still sense his mind?
Where is he? Concentrate.
That should sharpen the image.
Where is the Ion chamber?
Look after Tegan.
Which way? Which way?
Ah.
Has to be the right way.
Turlough?
I reset it.
No. What are you doing in here?
Did she? Well, it is part of the ion drive system.
Better reception. Interesting.
Wrack also uses this place as a receiver for something quite different.
Do you know what that is?
Only in appearance. It's function is that of a massive amplifier.
Yes.
It's only part of it. There's still the question of focus.
Well, Wrack only creates the power. She must have something to focus it onto. Now, how do you think she manages that?
Oh, no bigger than this.
The clasp. That's why it was out of period.
Critas the Greek.
Wrack gave him a clasp as a present. She must have done. And then she worked the same trick with Davy.
Well, that was it.
Well, I can't see him or Marriner accepting anything from Wrack. They don't trust her.
Oh, that won't stop her. She'll find a way.
Wait a minute. Not until I've worked out some sort of plan.
It's safer here. Far less likely to pick up my mind vibrations at this level.
I must find a way of staying on this ship.
To stop Wrack winning.
You couldn't cope. These creatures have vast powers. That's why none of them must win. To achieve further power would be a disaster.
We can but try.
Well, I'd hardly call it spying. We were welcomed as guests, given the freedom of the ship.
He's staying.
You don't understand. It was his idea. He wanted to stay. Come on.
Wrack mustn't win the race. He's stayed to prevent her.
Well, I think he wants to prove himself. At least, I hope so.
Er, I'm going to the wheelhouse.
The race is nearly over.
Not yet.
They've hoisted their moonrakers.
Pirate sails for speed. With those, they're faster than we are.
Yes.
They can pass us any time they want.
Why indeed?
No! You've got it the wrong way round. She's holding level with us! She's moved in for the kill.
I tell you, that's how she was positioned when the Greek ship exploded. She was lying level. And when Davy's ship was destroyed, practically alongside, don't you remember?
We can't pull away from her. She's got us where she wants us.
We must find the focus.
She must have done it. She must have got it aboard somehow. Did she give you anything when we were on board her ship? Anything at all? Think!
It has to be here somewhere. It has to be.
The point of focus. Without it, the power she channels is useless.
The power of darkness.
Well, it could be anything. Probably a crystal of some sort. So big, perhaps. Could be part of a jewel, a clasp, the hilt of a sword.
Which way?
Come on!
I can't destroy it. I'm a fool. Its power's multiplying. I have to get rid of it. Help me!
Just in time.
Impossibility? Not at all.
Because he didn't think of it. They're far more dependant on us than we are on them. Without us, they're empty nothings.
Not quite. Don't forget Turlough's over there.
If I'm to stop Wrack winning, I need my Tardis.
Oh, probably did it the world of good. Come on, no time to waste.
No.
I'll be back. I hope.
No, wait! The power you're tapping. You think it's under your control? It isn't. It will control you. You don't understand what it is.
No, Turlough.
I'm afraid the Captain can't be with us. She met with a rather unfortunate accident. Both the Captain and the First Mate fell overboard. I brought the ship into harbour with some assistance.
I leave the lies and deception to you.
I'm not ready for it. I don't think anyone is, especially Eternals.
Yes. Not now, Tegan.
There's nothing we can do.
I believe you.
You're missing the point. Enlightenment was not the diamond. Enlightenment was the choice.
Anywhere in particular?
Why not?

I wouldnt had thought it possible, but somehow weve materialised, for a split second of time, and been imprisoned in some kind of force. I simply cant break its hold. Somewhere, somehow, were being slowly dragged down.
All responses negative. Air thin and static. Hmm!
Oh, what is holding us here? What force, hmm?
Hmm? Oh.
Wrong? My boy, weve been dragged off our course. The question is, is it some natural phenomena or is it intelligent, deliberate, or for a purpose, hmm?
What
Oh yes, my dear, yes, Im confident that I can counteract it with more power. Yes. Nowm let me see.
Good. Good, The power response is satisfactory.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh, shes probably heard an extra-sonic sound. You know, the thing that young people and young animals hear. Excuse me, youre in the way.
Oh yes, I quite agree. I quite agree. The power build up is strong enough. Yes, quite satisfactory. Well now the motors. Wait a minute. Yes.
We seem to be caught! Trapped somehow. Is it some strange phenomena? Theres no power in the ship. Its useless.
All right, all right, dont snap at each other, my dear.
You probably saw some cosmic ray which is causing the interference.
So disturbing, all this interference.
I cant understand it. Well, theres nothing for it, my boy, but we shall, er, its a matter of exploration. We shall have to go and find the trouble of this interference and then learn how to counteract it.
Quite so.
Of course, my dear. Its in the first aid box. You know where it is. There, its facing you.
DOCTOR points to a box which is among many pieces on a table in the alcove.)
Nearly done, my boy, hmm?
Yes, yes, yes, of course, of course. Now then, I want you to wear this ADJ.
Its an Atmospheric Density Jacket, to be precise. Oh, I see. Is the atmosphere a bit thin?
Yes, Im afraid its rather sub-normal.
Oh, these are what they technically call a respiratory compensator.
Exactly, exactly.
Ah, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Hmm. Its one thing after another.
Yes, well, I, er, I, er. I didnt want to, er.
This is not merely a decorative object. Come along, come along.
Well, well, well. That is remarkable. Gracious. During all my travels, I dont think Ive ever come across this. Magical. Isnt it extraordinary? I say, are you there, Chesterton? Chesterton? What are you doing, dear boy? Fiddling and gaping over there. Come over here and learn something. Look here, do you see what this is? Mica, hmm?
Capable of withstanding great heat.
Have you got something sharp I can have for a moment, hmm?
Thats very clever. Very clever. You know, youve never done that before. Thats a remarkable conjuring trick.
Oh, my dear man.
Gold.
Echoes, dear boy!
Hmm? What sort of feeling?
No. No, no, no, no, I cant see any spooks or anything. I dont think so, no. Not particularly, no. I must say that if I lived here and I heard you roaring your head off, Id probably come down and take a look at you.
Yes, what if the powers thats got hold of the Tardis has taken your pen? Of course! Ha ha! Now then, theres something for us to solve. Come along, come along, come along.
Yes, but when? Its old, so old. Look at the state its in.
Its a pity we didnt bring a ladder with us. We might be able to see whats on the top.
No. No, pity. Well, it certainly has nothing to do with holding the ship here, dear boy.
Yes, its curious. Yes, yes, yes, but we must find something more tangible, hmm? Come along, come along.
Wait, wait, stop.
Youre a little premature. Lets have your tie.
I know youre not wearing one, dear boy, but the one round your middle, hmm?
Yes, well thats your affair, not mine.
Thank you. Now then.
Yes. Lets see.
There you are. Look, See that? Yes, there you are. You see?
Saved your life. You were about to have a wash in there, werent you, or probably drink some of it? We very nearly had the remnants of a Coal Hill School teacher in there instead of his wretched old, ragged old tie.
Yes, let's see now. Now, what have we got, hmm? Echoes. Interference. Gold. And now, acid. Yes, similar properties to formic acid. Yes, its strange, isnt it? Its very strange.
A light? Is it a reflection from a planet?
Now, my young man. If this is your idea of revenge for that tie then I think it's a pretty poor effort.
Now listen, we came here to find out the source of interference. Now I suggest we keep our minds on this subject. Youre rambling on. Come along. Thats it.
It probably comes from some sentient thing, or a machine operated by it. We must find the source of this interference. Now come on.
Theyve probably left the doors open. Come on.
Look out!
Stand still.
Ill go back to the ship and try and find something. Can you wait?
My ship. My Tardis.
Chesterton! Chesterton!
Ian.
Are you all right, boy?
Its a little blistered.
Whats happened to that weed, hmm?
Went where?
Yes, a cursed place. So barren. I wonder. Yes, cursed.
Oh, unfortunately, I cant help you at the moment, dear boy.
And I have a shock for you. The ships gone. Vanished. (Meanwhile, Barbara is now being followed by a giant winged insect.)
There must be an answer to it, dear boy. There must be answer! They cant even get in the ship, let alone operate it. The interior of my ship is inviolable.
It's my chest.
Oh, yes.
Yes, its these ADJ coats are no use. After about an hour, theyre useless.
Just about.
Yes, yes.
There, do you see those ridges? What are those ridges in the sand there? Have a look.
I heard the Tardis.
The ground seems firmer here.
Oh, all so strange, so unnatural. Ive never experienced anything in my life before like this. But we must continue with our search.
Take a look over there. Well, thats odd. Those are not track marks. Those are more like claw marks. Yes. Chesterton!
I think were on the right track, my boy.
Good gracious. Its hollow.
Yes, well preserved. Yes, a vertebrate creature, yes, highly developed, hmm!
Menoptra. Yes, does that word mean anything to you, hmm?
No, no, my boy. No, but its this rock formation and now this creature, this object, it suggests the planet Vortis.
The Isop galaxy. Yes, many light years from Earth. And yet the Vortis hasnt the moons and here, there there are several. Look, you see? You can see for yourself.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, but it would need a galactic explosion, you know, some kind of new force. Whether this Vortis planet has that or not, I cant be sure. Anyway, lets, come on, over here.
Pulsating.
No, look down there, my boy, hmm?
Apparently so. Weve got to get down there. I wish we had more knowledge of what we were up against. Ah, this wilderness.
The best thing is just to stand still.
Apart from rubbing our back legs together like some sort of grasshopper? I doubt if we could get on speaking terms with them. Stand still! Obey! These creatures on this planet are completely unknown to me. Just stand still and obey.
Remember those claw marks.
Organic matter, reproducing itself.
Yes, I wonder. I wonder how long its taken to grow that size, eh? A hundred or two hundred years?
History doesnt mean anything when you travel through space and time. All right, all right. Dont push, dont push!
My ship! The doors are open!
Whats the meaning of this, child? Who tried to get in here?
What do you creatures want?
Who are you? We come in peace.
We are alone. We have strayed from our astral plane.
We are peaceful travellers from Earth.
I know nothing of these Menoptra.
Please listen to me. I have not finished my explanation
Stand still.
Its unbelievable! Unbelievable! What did you do in the ship, child? What controls did you touch?
You have performed a miracle, my dear. You have re-aligned the fluid link. The power is back!
Trying to destroy my ship you will achieve nothing. Nothing! I have great secrets in my ship. We could help you.
Impossible. I cannot tell you why my ship withstood the fire of that gun unless you tell me the principle its built on.
Where is the fourth member of our party, hmm? Well?
I dont know what you mean, but I have an astral map, if that answers your question.
I see. So its the Menoptra that are invading your planet, hmm?
And you are not aware of their position?
I shall need assistance.
I shall need help even to do that.
Now it is their turn to receive instructions.
Let us go back into the Tardis.
Im just beginning to relax, my boy.
Er, yes, I think so. Yes, I must do something about this face of yours.
Yes, it seems theyve learnt their lesson. Here, dab some of that on your face. Theres some cotton wool there.
Hmm?
Well, to use the term of Earth, I suppose we should call them insects.
Size is only relative. In this rarified atmosphere, it appears that evolution has chosen that particular form of life on this planet.
Yes.
Well, its this voice. Its this, this, this, this, this Queen of the ants, you might say. If I can only trick her into neutralising this section of this area. I want you to try and track down Barbara, hmm?
Well, it has something to do with this Crater of Needles.
The only clue I can give you, dear boy, its behind a great web.
No, it isnt. Come on, give me a hand.
Oh, and by the way, I want you to take a couple of these. Theyll be very good for your breathing in this rarified atmosphere.
You leave Vicki to me, but when you do finally catch up with Barbara, see that she takes some. Shes probably had the same experience with breathing as we have.
No, no, no, no. Dont unplug it. You must never do that. You must never break the time and relative dimension link. Come on.
Oh, its useless. Its useless! Come along, put me through, will you? Come along, drop this hairdryer, or whatever it is.
No, good gracious me, no. Some kind of force of yours has jammed my instruments and whilst it continues, I cannot use them.
Very well, very well, take this thing away. Im afraid we cant help you to locate your invader.
Well, it appears, my boy, theyve obliged. Theyve neutralised and completely immobilised this section.
Its time you left.
Come along, cheer up, cheer up, my child. Its all right. Yes, here. Have a piece of chocolate. There you are.
Oh, come, come, come, come. You dont have to worry about him. Hes very good at this sort of thing. Yes, hell be back. Hell be back.
Hmm? Oh, Im trying to discover a little more about this invasion fleet, my child. The more we know, the safer it will be for us.
Ill just turned up this booster. Wait a minute.
Just turn up the recorder.
Did you understand any of that, hmm?
Yes. Thats where theyve taken Barbara.
It sounds as though were under attack, my dear.
I am still here.
Why question me? Surely you can see our movements.
Were we ever?
Yes, you can, but to what end? The information I have will die with me.
I am still collating the various readings of my instruments.
That is for you to decide. Am I really lying or do I possess this information, hmm?
Away!
Yes, I know, my dear, I know. I think Ive earned ourselves a little breathing space.
Nothing, nothing.
Just about as much as I ever want to. Well see. Come, lets look busy. Now, I want you to nip into the ship and bring me back a little red box and in it is a recording compound. Youll find it on the left near the first aid kit. Go at once and come back immediately.
Oh, I said a white box, child! Do you ever think! This is one of my specimens. Look.
Now, take it back.
Because I think we might find it more valuable later on, child, when Ian and Barbara have returned.
Oh, a hundred percent! A hundred percent!
Use the spider, child!
If the child dies, therell be no reason left for me to obey. I have located your enemy. My calculations are complete.
The Menoptra are massing on the planet Pictos.
It appears they are heading straight for Vortis. If you waste time in idle vengeance, in face of such an invasion, you will all be annihilated.
If I am given peace of mind for a while, I can find that out. That is, if its not too late.
Not before the child is released.
First, the child, hmm?
Yes, I know, my dear, I know.
I know. Be all right in a minute, hmm?
Just about enough for our survival. If I tell them everything, our usefulness will be ended. Now, weve got to get out of here and I want to find a place to hide this recorder. I dont propose to make them a present of the place of attack.
Yes, theres no doubt theyve alerted their invasion forces. Theyve acted very quickly on the little information that I gave them. Now, while theyre busy I want you to nip back into the ship, find my walking stick and bring it straight back here. Hurry!
Now the question is how to make it safe, hmm?
Yes, theres no mistaking it, my dear. Gold and something more than gold. Gold is the symbol of power on this planet. Which brings me to an incident with Ian and his pen.
Yes, it flew out of his hand just as he was about to give it to me. A gold pen. Now, we have got to find something to re-align this power.
Yes, that is the question, isnt it?
Yes, I think so, my dear. Well, now we know the Tardis is the opposing force, the question is, which is the stronger, hmm?
What will happen? Well, the astral map will be ruined, of course, but Im afraid we have no choice. Now just stand back a bit, my dear.
It is still incomplete.
No doubt your creatures told you about the explosion. (holds up the recorder) This is what caused the delay. You must wait.
Oh, nothing, nothing. Merely a piece of damaged equipment that happened
Ohh!
My dear, youre still wearing it.
Oh yes, we must capitalise on your action. Now we know the necklace no longer works on us, perhaps the force-field is being reversed. I wonder. If that is so, I can control that necklace with this power of my ring.
Now, look, look.
Now, this is what I want you to do, child. When you (whisper, whisper) Understand?
Splendid. Splendid.
Well, I think we shall get our friend to take us out of here. Go outside. Jeep your eyes open.
Yes, it appears they have gone to the plateau.
Now, dont count your chickens, child. Theres quite a lot ahead of us. Now go on, cautiously.
Oh! Most unpleasant! Oh well, my dear, so far, so good, hmm?
Yes, the Zarbis left here to go to the spearhead. Its just about. Yes, with luck we can follow their tracks.
Lets get moving. (to the Zarbi) You may not believe it, but you nearly ended up as lost property. (the Carsinome makes a noise) And the same to you.
Oh, must have a rest, child.
What?
Oh, yes, I see, I see.
Well, I havent noticed it before, my dear, but since you mention it, no I dont think so.
Oh, Ill buy you a collar for him at the next stop. But just you remember, child, if we lose him, theres about two hundred or more ahead of us, just like that. Now, come along, come along.
No! Do not attack him. Hes quite harmless.
My dear Barbara. Where is Chesterton, hmm?
A most detailed report. Yes, its interesting.
Oh, I dont see why not, my dear. What is in the centre of the web, hmm? Do you know?
Where does it draw its power from, hmm?
Yes, the magnetic pole, I see, I see. You mean it draws and uses the power from the planet Vortis.
Yes, I wonder why I didnt realise that before. The same force drew and holds the Tardis here. Yes, of course, its remarkable, most interesting.
The plan? The plan. Yes, my dear, yes. Yes, but with a slight difference.
Yes, I think well go ahead with the mock attack as planned, that will be your responsibility, my dear. A time we shall agree to.
That, I shall take along with me. The girl and I will return to the Zarbi headquarters
Of course. I dont see why not?
Thank you.
Thank you. I have great admiration for your wise men and their judgement. Now, my dear, is everything quite clear, hmm? BARBARA: Yes, Doctor. You will return to headquarters. Once youre safely there, we start the attack to draw out the Zarbi while you make for the centre.
Precisely. Come, child.
Oh, now, now, now, cheer up, cheer up. I dont particularly want to go back there myself.
Yes, what is it? What do you want? Excuse me. Well, what do you want, hmm?
Oh, you think so, do you?
You do? Better than I?
To control him, you will have to use my ring. And that is of untold value.
No! No, my dear, no!
Our friend here has suggested that the creature goes along with your party.
Hmm? (he gives his ring to Prapillus) Here, take it!
You may not. Use it and return it.
On your life, return it.
I think youd better take this, my child. (the Isop-tope) Itll probably be less conspicuous with you. Come on.
Leave it me, child. Leave it to me.
We have been on a slight exploration.
Brought back? We came of our own free will. We are not to be subjected like the Zarbis, or terrorised like the Menoptra! We are
Oh, we we shall be taken to the centre, child. Try, try not to be afraid.
Ah, you never let me have the web destructor back again, child. We may not get another chance.
Oh yes, I gave it to you. Come along, my child, come along, come along.
Well where is it, child?
This infernal light is too bright for my eyes.
Theres only one thing you owe me, my friend.
That is my ring, hmm?
Thank you, thank you.
Well, my boy, weve managed to come out of this knot unscathed.
Yes, its quite a problem, isnt it. Its something to do with coal, wasnt it?
Yes, yes, quite so. Quite so. Come on.

Start the clock.
Your train awaits, my lady.
The baggage car. But thanks for lying. The real wonderful is through here.
There were many trains to take the name Orient Express, but only one in space.
Completely faithful recreation of the original Orient Express. Except slightly bigger. And in space. Oh, and the rails are actually hyperspace ribbons. But in every other respect, identical. Painstaking attention to detail.
Most of the time.
You're doing it again.
The smile.
It's the sad smile. It's a smile but you're sad. It's confusing. It's like two emotions at once. It's like you're malfunctioning.
I just thought this would be a good one to
Yeah?
Shall we?
Oh, I remember when this was all planets as far as the eye could see. All gone now. Gobbled up by that beast. And there's that smile again. I don't even know how you do that. CLARA: I really thought I hated you, you know?
Well, thank God you kept that to yourself. There was this planet, Obsidian. The planet of perpetual darkness.
Good, fine. Well, I'm glad that we cleared that up. There was also a planet that was made completely of shrubs.
Frankly, that would be an absolutely astonishing guess if I did know.
Were people really confused? Cos I'm confused. Did everybody leave?
Can I talk about the planets now?
Thedion Four. Constant acid rain. Had a lovely picnic there once, wearing a gas mask.
Now, there's a question that's never asked often enough. Let's say intestinal parasites.
It might be nothing. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically their job description.
Well, seen by no one except her, which suggests that it wasn't there. A dying brain, lack of oxygen, hallucinations. Anyway, people do just die sometimes. She was over a hundred years old.
Clara, you actually sound as if you want this to
Are you sure?
To our last hurrah.
Isn't it?
I thought that's what you wanted.
Of course. Why wouldn't I do that?
Is it boring?
The last hurrah.
It's nothing. Nothing. Definitely. Sure. Ninety nine percent sure. Really? Ninety nine percent? That's quite high. Is that the figure you're sticking with? Okay, okay. Seventy five. Well, that's jumped quite a bit. You've just lost twenty four percent.
Because you know what this sounds like, don't you? No, do tell me. A mummy that only the victim can see. I was being rhetorical. I know exactly what this sounds like.
Yes, well, it didn't do Mrs Pitt much good, did it?
Oh, I don't think so. The records show that the machine did everything it could to keep her alive.
What do you know?
Really? Well, I know that when I find a man loitering near a chair that someone died in, I do just the same.
The Doctor. Nosey Parker.
What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
You know. The Foretold. Mythical mummy. Legend has it that if you see it, you're a dead man.
Emil Moorhouse, professor of alien mythology. I'm the Doctor. Pleased to meet you. So, the most interesting thing about the Foretold. Go.
No, no, no. Nice try. Very atmospheric. But that's not it. Try again.
The myth of the Foretold first appeared over five thousand years ago. In some stories, there is a riddle or secret word that is supposed to make it stop. Some characters try to bargain with it, offer riches, confess sins. All to no avail.
I know a lot. Because, from time to time, it turns out to be true.
Isn't that everyone's dream? But you still haven't answered my riddle. What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
Nope. Even colder.
Mrs Pitt, the old woman who died.
No. That's my answer.
No. The fact that you were here to witness it.
Excuse me, Professor.
I think we need to talk.
I'm not a passenger. I'm your worst nightmare.
Really? That's your worst? Okay, I'm a mystery shopper. I could do with an extra pillow and I'm very disappointed with your breakfast bar and all of the dying.
Come on, Captain. Where would we all be if we all followed our job descriptions, hmm? Good question. Glad you asked. In your case, you'd be doing something instead of climbing inside a bottle.
Yes, I'm sure you have. And I'm sure you do just enough of your job to avoid complaints.
Wounded in battle, honourable discharge. And this is just a guess, but I think you've had the fight knocked out of you. You expected this to be a cushy desk job where you could put your head down until retirement. Well, I'm sorry. As of today, that dream is over.
Yes, let's just sit around and wait for the evidence while the bodies pile up. Or here's a crazy thought. We could do something to stop it. Why am I even talking to you?
Quick work, Perkins. Maybe too quick.
Sixty six seconds. It fits the myth. Did you see the lights flicker?
Wake up
Sleepy-head. Time for breakfast. Knowing this train, it'll taste
Amazing.
Can't even get that right, huh?
Bad food on trains is traditional.
Listen, there's been another mummy murder. So our last hurrah
Just became a bit more interesting.
What? Where are you?
Clara!
Is that you?
Ow!Computer, can you open the door, please?
Oh. Forget it.
Oh. Now the stupid sonic
Screwdriver's not working.
I don't know. Some sort of a
Suppression field, I would guess. And it has to be a guess because, as I say, the stupid sonic screwdriver's not working. What are you even
Doing in there?
What, was I supposed to waken you up? Drag you out of bed
Because I had a hunch?I thought you didn't want to do this any more.
Is it in there?
Clara, it's coming.
But the lights?
My friend's inside.
Clara, I'm going to have to call you back.
You know, I'm going to have to mark you down for this.
Oh, come on, Captain. How many people have to die before you stop looking the other way?
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, could I have a moment of your time, please? There's a monster on this train that can only be seen by those about to die. If you
And the facade drops away because what use are a bunch of scientists without a lab?
No. Hard light holograms. They were never really here. Fake passengers to make up the numbers.
You saidcapture, implying that you can't control this thing. And yet somehow you got it on board. How?
And kills at regular intervals.
No! No! No!
But even if they agree to this, how are they supposed to study a creature that they can't even see? We don't even know what the species is.
Perkins, start the clock.
Oh, dear. Hard cheese. What can you see? Details.
What kind of bandages? Old? New?
Whole? Ragged?
Listen to me! You can see this thing. We can't. Tell us what you can see. Even the smallest detail might help save the next one.
Well, that is implied, isn't it? Yes, this is probably the end for you. But make it count. Details, please.
Keep talking. Don't waste this chance.
W-w-w-what?
This is not a myth. This is real. Forget your superstitions. Tell us what you can see.
Of course it is. That's why we're here. To study our own demise. So let's get to work. Come on. Chop, chop.
Clara Oswald.
Yes. It's where they want us to put the Foretold if we
Capture it.
Sorry.
Teeny bit busy round here. What else?
So, we're not the first.
Clara, I have to go.
Less valuable passengers? How does it choose?
No, no, no. Not the computer, the Foretold. How does it choose who to kill? We've assumed it's random. What if it's not? I want full histories on all the victims. Medical, social, personal.
Don't mention it.
Health? Are you sure? Mrs Pitt, the first victim. She was over a hundred years old. The frailest passenger on board.
What?
Because he worked with food. The next one, the guard?
It's picking off the weakest first. Sensing the illness somehow. The fake organs, even psychological issues. But this is good news, because it means we can work out who is next. I want the medical records of everybody alive who is still on board. If anyone's had as much as a cold, I want to know about it.
It seems so. Why?
Which means that you are probably next. Which is good to know.
Well, of course not for you, because you're going to die. But I mean for us, from a research point of view.
Well, there's goes our head start. Perkins, start the clock.
What can you see?
Oh no, no, no, no. That didn't work before.
Where is it now?
Am I close?
If you move, will it follow?
Keep looking at it, but back off quick as you like.
Teleporter. That means tech. Then sixty six seconds to do what? Sixty six seconds. That seems very, very specific. Too specific for organic. So, what, more tech? What? More? A countdown clock? Something charging?
No. No, no, no. We can't do that. We can't mourn. People with guns to their heads, they cannot mourn. We do not have time to mourn. Everybody, what takes sixty six seconds to charge up or to change state? Anyone?Am I surrounded by idiots? If only I could see this thing.
I'm not joking about it. One minute with me and this thing, it would be over!
Well, ah, on a good day, I'm both. Ancient tech. This thing has been around for centuries. How? Tech that keeps it alive. Tech that drains energy from the living. Scanner.
Deep tissue scan. He's been leached of almost all energy on a cellular level. The heart attack is just a, is just a side effect.
But why take sixty six seconds to drain us? Why not just pounce?
That's why only the victims can see it. It takes them out of phase so it can drain their energy. You, sir, are a genius! This explains everything! Apart from what it is and how it's doing it. Sorry, I jumped the gun there with theyou're a genius, that explains everything remark.
Ah, of course. That makes perfect sense.
Clara, it doesn't care.
Her bad day, her bereavement, her little breakdown puts her squarely in its cross hairs. She's next.
Every simulation we've run confirms it.
This thing can teleport.
We need her here. Even the computer agrees.
Of course not. Why would you think that? This is another chance
To observe it in action.
Of course, as it kills her.
If it happens in there, it'll be a waste
Sobring her to us.
Well, I don't know. Lie to her. Tell her I can save her. Whatever it takes to get her here.
Good for you.
It's probably Gus trying to block our escape route.
Well, he has tried to entice me here before. Free tickets, mysterious summons, he even phoned the Tardis number. Do you know how difficult a number
I didn't
Not yet.
Focus. Focus. Focus! All of that is your grief, your trauma, your resentment. And now
It's mine.
No. No, it's not. Not for me. Cos now it thinks I'm you.
Start the clock. (to the mummy) Hello.
I'm so pleased to finally see you. I'm the Doctor and I will be your victim this evening.
Markings like the ones the scroll. Oh, and your father. Sorry.
A tattered piece of cloth attached to a length of wood that you will kill for.
That doesn't sound like a scroll. That sounds like a flag! And if that sounds like a flag, if this is a flag, that means that you are a soldier, wounded in a forgotten war thousands of years ago. But they've worked on you, haven't they, son? They've filled you full of kit. State of the art phase camouflage, personal teleporter.
And all that tech inside you, it just won't let you die, will it? It won't let the war end. It just won't let you stop until the war is over. We surrender.
No.
The clock has stopped. You're relieved, soldier.
So was he.
Save it. We're not out of the woods yet. Well, Gus, I think we solved your little puzzle. Ancient soldier being driven by malfunctioning tech.
Ah, well, there's a shocker.
My enemy's enemy is my friend. Especially when he has a built in teleporter.
A little more work.
Couple of minutes. Max. I'll give you a shout.
Oh hello, again. Sleep well?
Oh, that was ages ago.
And what? Oh, and we got off the train. Oh, well, the teleporter worked eventually. Beamed everyone into the Tardis. No casualties, just a bevy of sleeping beauties. I tried hacking Gus from the Tardis, find out who set this all up. He really didn't like that. Set off some fail-safe thing. Blew up the train.
Blew up the train. But we got away. Then I dropped everyone off at the nearest civilised planet, which happened to be here.
You seemed happy asleep so I just left you.
No, I just saved you and I let everyone else suffocate. Ha, ha, ha.
Yeah, this is just my cover story.
I couldn't risk Gus finding out my plan and stopping me.
Would you like to think that about me? Would that make it easier? I didn't know if I could save her. I couldn't save Quell, I couldn't save Moorhouse. There was a good chance that she'd die too. At which point, I would have justmoved onto the next, and the next, until I beat it. Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones. But you still have to choose.
Oh, you did, did you?
Really? Well, I suppose, whoever I did get in, it might just be easier to have them stay on board for a while. I don't suppose you'd know of anyone?
Yes, it does. Frequently.
Well, I won't keep you. Goodbye, Perkins. Good to meet you.
Love what?
Why would I?
It's my life.
Like what?
You can't really tell if something's an addiction till you try and give it up.
Let me know how it goes.
Was that Danny? What did he want?
Sorry, I
That's a big change of heart.
Seriously?
Well, I'm glad that you said that, because you know that one that's made entirely of shrubs. Are you sure about this?
No.

There you are, Jo. A perfect landing.
Now, now, Miss Grant. Let's not be impatient.
It's hardly a joyride, Jo. This is the Tardis' first test flight since I got it working again.
Mmm hmm.
One minute, Jo. Routine landing procedures first, eh? Let's see what the scanners have to tell us.
Must be on the blink.
I hope you're as in good condition when you're as old as she is.
Now, let's have a look. Yes. Yes, there's a tiny fault in the interstitial beam synthesiser. Still, I can put that right later.
Mmm hmm?
Yes, well, everything outside seems perfectly normal. Atmosphere, temperature, gravity. Yeah. Cheer up, Jo. It's a perfect landing.
Well, we seem to be half way up a mountain. We're balanced on the edge.
Come towards me. Come on! Now, give me your hand, very, very gently! Ready now?
Right, jump!
Jo, the Tardis may have its faults, but it is indestructible. Our main worry is how to get to it. We certainly can't climb down there. Jo! Jo, look up there!
Well, we certainly can't recover the Tardis by ourselves. We'd better get up there and see if we can find help.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, you could always wait here, I suppose.
Exactly. So the sooner we find out, the better. Come on.
Well, we certainly can't stay here, Jo. I'll tell you what. Let's traverse along this ledge for a bit. I'll see if there's another way out. Have a look that way.
Yes, what is it? Jo? Jo, where are you? Jo, where are you?
What is it?
Jo, come at look at this.
It looks like some sort of shrine.
No, neither have I. At least not on Earth. Come on.
Which way indeed? Eenie, meenie, mynie, mo.
Yes. If the tunnel's never used, why is this torch still alight?
Somewhere inside the castle, I should think. Let's take a look around.
That, Jo, was an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars.
Yes, indeed I have, and believe me, they're not very pleasant company.
Late? Er, yes, my apologies to the Committee but, er, our space shuttle crash-landed down the mountain. I wonder if something could be done about rescuing it.
How do you do?
I'm afraid that will not be possible. We have lost everything in the crash.
Well, naturally. Why, why do you bother to ask?
Yes, of course. Will you excuse me.
Your Majesty, as delegate from Earth, I greet you. May I present Her Royal Highness, the Princess Josephine, of Tardis.
The Princess is here in the capacity of a royal observer only.
Yes, in a democratic sort of way.
No, no, of course not, I
Yes, thank you for reminding me. I
Threatened? Perhaps you'd be kind enough to explain that to me from the beginning?
Gentlemen, please!
Do my ears deceive me? Members of the Galactic Federation squabbling like a gang of small children?
That is a splendid idea.
Look out!
Look out!
All you all right, Princess?
I'm sorry to have been so abrupt about it, gentlemen.
I think we should investigate what caused this, Hepesh.
If only as a matter of protocol.
It must have been a pretty substantial type of ghost to have shifted a solid granite statue.
Well, the point is what does King Peladon believe?
Your Majesty is an enlightened ruler, but who will your people believe? King Peladon or Aggedor?
I think it would be a tragedy if the conference were to break up now.
His Majesty deserves the opportunity to convince us, surely?
You don't think that King Peladon would keep you here by force, do you?
Your Majesty, we will adjourn now and consider our position. We will let you know our decision as soon as possible.
It's an electronic key. Used for opening doors by identifying the bearer electronically. Probably used for their spaceship.
Well, the Ice Warriors of course. It's made from trisilicate, which can only be found on the planet Mars.
Yes, I think it's highly likely.
I'm not sure. Well, you managed to slip away without anybody noticing, remember?
Well, the last time that I encountered them, Jo, they were trying to colonise the planet Earth, and Peladon is very like Earth.
Do they. Well, believe me, I know the Ice Warriors, Jo. They're a savage and a warlike race. No, among the delegates, only Ssorg's strength could have shifted that statue.
Well, who else could be responsible? Arcturus is only a box of tricks, and I hardly think Centauri would hurt a fly, would you?
Neither. She is an it. It's a hermaphrodite hexapod.
The point is, what possible motive could they have?
I didn't really have any choice, did I.
Well, how do you like being a princess, Princess?
It sounds like an alarm. Come on.
Well, someone's taken the servo-junction unit of his life support system. I'll have to re-wire the circuits.
It's a small plastic cube full of very fine circuitry. Why?
Obviously. So?
You'll do no such thing, Jo. It's far too dangerous. I'm going to try a little direct confrontation here.
Jo, please do as I say, there's a good girl.
Someone has disconnected a vital part of his life support system. I'm trying to save him. Now, please, leave me alone.
I think that should do it.
Yes, he'll be all right in a moment.
This is the work of a skilled, technical knowledge. Your medieval monster, Hepesh, would simply have tried to smash Arcturus' protective globe.
Yes, of course, you would. But nevertheless, you can't deny that you do have the necessary technical knowledge.
How very fortunate, Izlyr. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Let me past, Grun.
What do you want? You want me to come with you? All right, all right, I'm coming. Where are you taking me?
In here? Why? Is someone in trouble? Well, who, Grun? Not the Princess? All right, all right!
What is that noise, Grun?
Grun! Grun, come back here! Grun! Grun! Grun!
Give me a chance to explain, Hepesh.
No, Hepesh, give me a chance!
But there was no sacrilege intended, sir.
I had no idea that the tunnels would lead there.
Surely your Majesty must know that beneath the citadel there is a network of secret passages.
King Peladon, I swear to you that I am telling the truth. I am innocent.
Very well, your Majesty, I accept the challenge. But who do I fight?
Yes, you're a wily old bird, aren't old you, Hepesh? But you do realise, don't you, that my death would cause a major interplanetary scandal? Consider the consequences, Hepesh.
I see. Killed while trying to escape, is that it?
I'm afraid I can't. Well, not without my space shuttle.
Yes, that's it. Where is it now?
Well, that's splendid. And what about Princess Josephine?
Hepesh, why do you go to so much trouble? You could simply have me killed.
Yet you slap the Federation in the face by sabotaging the commission. Why?
Afraid? Afraid of what? The Federation is your safeguard.
The Federation's real intent is to help you.
The progress that they offer, that we offer, isn't like that.
Free? With your people imprisoned by ritual and superstition?
You can hardly expect your pet ghost to take on the whole Federation single-handed, can you?
Oh? Who stands with you?
Yes. I rather hoped I'd meet up with you, old chap.
Klokleda partha mennin kletch. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Klokleda sheena tirra nach. Haroon, haroon, haroon.
Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Well, I must say, you seem quite partial to old Venusian lullabies, don't you, Aggedor, old chap, hmm? Right, let's see how friendly you really are. All right, take it easy.
There, that's it. There's a good chap.
Oh, sorry. Not quite under.
Klokleda partha mennin kletch. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Klokleda
Tirra nach. Haroon, haran, haroon.
No, Jo, keep back!
Jo, keep back!
Jo!
Oh, Jo, you idiot. I'd just started to get through to him.
By a kind of technical hypnosis.
No, not exactly. Merely empathy.
Yes, it's a kind of telepathic understanding, Jo. Jo? Oh, good grief. Jo, snap out of it!
Well, you just ruined a very promising experiment, that's what happened.
Yes. Yes, of course you did. And very brave you were, too. Come on. Let's see if we can find King Peladon.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Hepesh.
Your Majesty. I bring you a message. From Aggedor.
Well we just did. And I must say, he's quite pleasant company, for an animal. He didn't even seem to mind when I scratched him behind the ears.
Aggedor is no spirit, your Majesty, but a truly noble beast. But his power is being used falsely, however, to prevent any chance that you may have of entering the Galactic Federation.
Rubbish! His manifestation, as you call it, is solid, hairy, fact.
He lives in the tunnels beneath the city, sire.
The entrance is hidden, your Majesty.
Once I have proved what Aggedor really is, the trial by combat, sir, will hardly become necessary.
All right, live, Grun. I would not kill the King's champion.
Arcturus and Hepesh.
Faked, your Majesty. He told Hepesh what to do.
Planted by Hepesh, or one of his agents.
Well, that's simple, your Majesty. Hepesh found that on a high mountain a few still existed. So he captured one, trained it and kept it hidden in the tunnels beneath the citadel, ready to pop out whenever he needed a bit of haunting.
The entire planet of Peladon, or effective control of it, which comes to the same thing.
That's why he wanted to make sure that Peladon did not enter the Galactic Federation. You see, he'd already made a private secret alliance with Hepesh.
Ah, but is it?
But Hepesh is still very much alive.
You see, Hepesh believed everything that Arcturus told him. He still does. He firmly believes that entering the Galactic Federation would mean slavery and he'd go to any lengths to stop you joining.
Accuse the Ice Warriors of murdering Arcturus.
Exactly. And then all the rest of the Galactic Federation would take sides and
And Peladon would become the first battlefield. Blasted and sterile.
Replace Hepesh with someone you can trust, your Majesty. Now!
It's not easy to be a king, Peladon. But unless you replace Hepesh, he will destroy everything that you have worked for.
Well, sire?
Then I think we ought to try and persuade you. Your Majesty, will you excuse us? We have the need of a private conference for the benefit of Alpha Centauri.
Jo, do you realise how dangerous and complex this situation has become? Hepesh could still bring Peladon to his way of thinking, and if that happens, he'll have won without a fight.
Jo, you seem to be forgetting something else. Officially we don't even exist. We're just a couple of imposters.
Yeah, so that's why Grun was beckoning at me like that.
Jo, I want you to go ahead and take charge of the conference. Work on Centauri. Once you've got a unanimous decision, act.
I'm going to see a man about an open door. Off you go.
Grun! Grun, what happened? Who attacked you? Who?
H. What, Hepesh? And a soldier? How many soldiers? Many? If he takes charge of the citadel, we don't stand much chance.
Perhaps we do. Come on. You're not frightened, are you, a big chap like you? Well, don't be. You come with me, come on.
Grun, you're a brave warrior. What you're going to see now may amaze you, but just you trust me.
All right, old chap. You remember me, don't you? You remember me. (sings) Klokleda partha mennin klatch. Haroon, haroon, haroon. Klokleda sheena teri nach. Haroon, haroon, haroon.
Haroon, haroon, haroon. Haroon, harun, haroon. Haroon, harun, haroon. Haroon, harun, haroon. Haroon, harun, haroon. There you are, Grun. Yes, he's quite under now. Not such a terrifying creature after all, is he? Right, I think it's about time that King Peladon learned the truth, don't you? Come on, Aggedor. Come on, old chap, that's it. Come on, Aggedor. That's it. Come on, Grun.
Who dares challenge Peladon!
Kneel and pay homage to his sacred guardian!
Kneel!
And I speak for Aggedor. And I accuse you, Hepesh, of being not only a traitor to your king, but also to your sacred trust.
Back! Back, that's it. Back, back.
Tell your men to lay down their arms. Your leader is dead.
Come on, Jo. Follow me. I've got a nice surprise for you.
You wait and see. You ready?
All right then.
Right, take a look at this.
Some of Peladon's stout lads heaved here up the mountainside for us.
Yes, never better. I told you the Tardis was indestructible.
So do I, Jo. So do I.
You don't really think that our appearance on the planet of Peladon at this precise crisis in their history was just coincidence, do you?
Yes, I think so.
No, not yet, but I will, Jo. Just give me time. Still, now we've done what they wanted us to do, I suppose they'll whip us straight back to Earth.
Yeah, that's true. You know, I haven't seen a coronation since Elizabeth the first's. Or was it Queen Victoria?
Don't worry. It's only Aggedor.
The trouble is he seems to have grown rather fond of me. He keeps following me about. Hello, Aggedor.
There's a good chap. All right, down, Aggedor. Down boy, down! I think I'd better go and lock him up.
Come on. Come on, Aggedor.
Your Majesty. Easy, Aggedor. That's it. Come on, this way.
Your Majesty. Oh, excuse me sire, but your court officials are in a state of considerable panic.
Right, we'll just see the ceremony and slip quietly away, all right?
Jo? You do want to come back?
Mmm hmm. In any case, I wouldn't like to lose you. Shall we join the procession?
Pity about that. I rather wanted to see that coronation.
Queen Victoria's? I've already seen Queen Victoria's. JO: I haven't. Let's go again.
All right.

Seriously?
Permission?
You know who she grows up to be, so you know I will find her.
Sorry. Hello. Doctor not following this. Doctor very lost. You never said I was hot?
Then why don't I know you? I danced with everyone at the wedding. The women were all brilliant. The men were a bit shy.
Anywhere in particular?
You've shot it! You shot my Tardis! You shot the console!
Argh! How's it my fault?
That was a clever lie, you idiot! Anyone could tell that was a clever lie.
Out, out, out! Everybody out. Don't breathe the smoke, just get out!
A room.
I don't know what room. I haven't memorised every room in the universe yet. I had yesterday off. Mels, don't go in there.
Bad smoke. Don't breathe the bad, bad, smoke. Bad, deadly smoke because somebody shot my Tardis!
Ooo, hello. Sorry, is this your office? Had a sort of collision with my vehicle. Faults on both sides, let's say no more about
It.
Believe me, it was an accident.
You see? You see? Time travel, it never goes to plan.
It's a police telephone box from London, England. That's right, Adolf. The British are coming.
Rory, take Hitler and put him in that cupboard over there. Now do it.
Are you okay?
Yes, that was a faint. A perfect faint.
What about him?
Rory!
Hey, look at me. Just hold on.
What stories? Tell me what stories. Vampires in Venice. That's a belter.
Good idea, let's get married. You stay alive and I'll marry you, deal? Deal?
As soon as you're well, I'll get on the phone.
Back! Back! Back! Get back!
Mels. Short for
You named your daughter after your daughter.
Who's Benjamin?
Spoilers.
This isn't the River Song we know yet. This is her right at the start. Doesn't even know her own name.
Oh, hello. I thought we were getting married.
What she's programmed to.
Hello, Benjamin.
Of course I noticed.
As soon as I knew you were coming, I tidied up a bit.
I know you know.
Why? Are you busy?
If you were in a hurry, you could've killed me in the cornfield.
Demons Run, remember? This is what they were building. My bespoke psychopath.
Only River Song gets to call me that.
An old friend of mine.
No warning for me then?
What have you done? River!
What have you done?
Poisoned me. But I'm fine. Well, no, I'm dying, but I've got a plan.
Not dying. See? Fine.
Take this. The Tardis can home in on it. Now, go. Get after her.
No, no, the smoke's fine. The poison will kill me first. Now, get after River!
Ah, well, she's been brainwashed. It all makes sense to her. Plus, she is a woman. Oh, shut up. I'm dying.
Extractor fans on! Oh, that works.
I'm shutting down. I need an interface. Voice interface. Come on, emergency.
Voice interface enabled.
Oh no, no, no, no, no. Give me someone I like.
Oh, thanks. Give me guilt.
Also guilt.
More guilt. Argh. Come on, there must be someone left in the universe I haven't screwed up yet.
Oh. Oh, Amelia Pond, before I got it all wrong. My sweet little Amelia.
Hey, let's run away and have adventures. Come along, Pond.
You are so Scottish. How am I doing?
Okay. So, basically better regenerate, that's what you're saying.
Unless I'm cured, yeah?
Why do you keep saying that?
You see? There you go again. Basically skipping thirty one whole minutes when I'm absolutely fine. Scottish, that's all I'm saying.
Scotland's never conquered anywhere, you know. Not even a Shetland. River needs me. She's only just beginning. I can't die now.
I'm going out in the first round. Ringing any bells? Argh! Okay, need something for the pain now. Come on, Amelia. It's me. Please.
Amelia, listen to me. I can be brave for you, but you have got to tell me how.
Amelia. Amelia, please.
What did you say? Fish fingers and custard? Oh, Amelia Pond. Fish fingers and custard. Fish fingers and custard!
Sorry, did you say she killed the Doctor? The Doctor? Doctor who?
Oh, you should always waste time when you don't have any. Time is not the boss of you. Rule four hundred and eight. Amelia Pond, judgment death machine. Why am I not surprised? Sonic cane.
Never knowingly. Never knowingly be serious.
Rule twenty seven. You might want to write these down. Oh, it's a robot.
With four hundred and twenty three life signs inside. A robot
Worked by tiny people. Love it. But how do you all get in there, though.
Bigger on the inside? No, basic miniaturisation sustained by a
Compression field. Ooo. Watch what you eat, it'll get you every time.
Amy, if you and Rory are okay, signal me.
Thanking you.
Argh! I'm so sorry. Leg went to sleep. Just had a quick left leg power nap. I forgot I had one scheduled. Actually, better sit down. I think I heard the right one yawning.
Don't you touch her! Do not harm her in any way!
I'm not dead.
Well, at least I'm not a time travelling shape shifting robot operated by miniaturised cross people, which, I have got to admit, I didn't see coming. What do you want with her?
And I'm the Doctor. So what's it to you?
What? You got yourselves time travel, so you decided to punish dead people?
And then what?
I'd ask you who you think you are
But I think the answer is pretty obvious. So, who do you think
I am, huh? The woman who killed the Doctor. It sounds like you've got my biography in there. I'd love a peek.
Yeah, well, I'll be dead in three minutes.
There isn't much foreknowledge left.
Question. I'm dying. Who wants me dead?
What is the Silence? Why is it called that? What does it mean?
What question?
Yes, but what is the question?
Oh. Well, fat lot of use that is, you big ginge. Call yourself a Records argh! Argh! Kidneys are always the first to quit. I've had better, you know.
Amy. Rory. Amy
Can you hear me?
Just stop them. She's your daughter. Just stop them.
Just do it!
She's your daughter. Just stop them.
Please. Now we have to save your parents. Don't run. Now, I know you're scared, but never run when you're scared. Rule seven. Please.
River, please.
Help me. Save Amy and Rory. Help me.
Just help me.
Oh, Pond, you've got a schedule for everything.
No. Sorry, Rory, you can't. Nobody can. Ponds, listen to me. I need to talk to your daughter.
Find her. Find River Song and tell her something from me.
River. No. What are you doing?
Rule one. The Doctor lies.
No, she won't. She will be amazing.
Sisters of the Infinite Schism. Greatest hospital in the universe.
Amy, I know. But we have to let her make her own way now. We have too much foreknowledge. Dangerous thing, foreknowledge.
Nothing.
Just some data I downloaded from the Teselecta. Very boring.
Well, she did kill me, and then she used her remaining lives to bring me back. As first dates go, I'd say that was mixed signals.
Oh, she'll come looking for us.
Oh, Pond. Haven't you figured that one out yet?

Look, I tell you there's no need for a test, Jo. I've been here before and the air is perfectly
Yeah, that's odd.
Yes. Yes, gaseous sulphides, low concentration. Nothing to worry about.
Well, I can assure you that the last time I was here, the air was like wine.
Where?
Jo, I don't steer the Tardis, I programme it, and according to programme, this is Metebelis Three, the famous blue planet of the Acteon group.
That's extraordinary. We appear to be in some kind of a machine.
Yes, you're right. Come on.
Well, to find out where we are, of course.
Yes, well, we may have slightly overshot the blue planet, but we must be on one of planets in the group. We'll soon see.
What is it?
Well, let's take a look, shall we?
Greetings!
All right, all right, all right, all right. We're friends.
Jo, when you've travelled as much as I have, you'll learn never to judge by appearances. These creatures may look like chickens, but for all we know, they're the intelligent life form on this planet.
Singapore.
Oh, Jo, do come on.
Shush.
Appearances can be very deceiving, Jo. There's something wrong here.
No, that's impossible.
No. That's impossible too. Come on, but keep low.
Okay.
(sotto) No, there's only one explanation.
(sotto) This isn't Earth. It just looks like it.
(sotto) 1926?
(sotto) No.
(sotto) Come on, Jo.
(sotto) Back to the Tardis.
(sotto) Well, I don't know what's happening here, but I don't like it. Why do you want to stay?
That's a plesiosaurus!
It's incredible! If this really is 1926, the plesiosaurus has been extinct for a hundred and thirty million years!
(silent) Come on.
Hello. Topping day, what?
Er, yes, but only temporarily.
On that contrary, sir, I
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, that's an excellent idea, Major. I'll have a large scotch.
I told you we should have left I wanted to.
Here, Jo. Look at this.
Any more of these about on the ship, or is this the only one?
These. Is this the only one?
Don't underestimate us, sir.
Tell me, is this ship the SS Bernice?
I didn't, but I do now. It makes everything much clearer. Thank you.
Hmm?
Yes, relatively speaking. An extinct monster, that plate out there on the deck. Yes, this is all most interesting.
What?
Oh yes, it's been blocked from his consciousness. Yes. If I'm right, it would have to be. It's certainly no part of the fabric of this ship.
A great lump of what? It's not steel, copper or iron. That metal is unknown on Earth, Jo.
No.
Oh, look. Daly's been keeping track of the date.
I suppose the name of this ship means nothing to you, Jo?
Well, in its time, the SS Bernice was as famous a sea mystery as the Marie Celeste.
Nobody really knows. A freak tidal wave was the popular explanation, although the Indian Ocean was as flat as a millpond on that night.
No, she vanished, Jo. Two days out from Bombay on June the 4th, 1926, the SS Bernice just disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Yes, intriguing, isn't it?
Mmm hmm.
Well?
Oh, you've noticed that, have you? Well done. Shall I tell you something that you may not have noticed? It's broad daylight outside.
If this really is after dinner, and we are in the Indian Ocean, it should be pitch dark.
No, that only works on electronic locks, Jo. We need something far more primitive.
Oh, they'd do fine if only we had any.
It slides open.
Anti-magnetic cohesion, I should think.
No, you wouldn't have done, Jo. You were born about a thousand years too early for that.
Without a magnetic core extractor, no.
On the contrary. I happen to have got one in the Tardis.
Yes, I know, getting to the Tardis.
They can only lock us up again, can't they.
Come on.
(sotto) Yes, I know.
(sotto) Shush.
(silent) Come on.
(sotto) In a minute, Jo. If my theory's right, we should be getting confirmation any minute now.
(sotto) About what's happening to this ship.
(sotto) Yes, well, naturally. You see, they've all been programmed to repeat a simple behaviour pattern.
(sotto) Very probably.
(sotto) Yes, exactly. Historically speaking, this collection is a bit of a jumble, I must admit.
(sotto) Jo, have you ever seen any small boys collecting sea creatures and putting them into a rock pool?
(sotto) And then after a minute all the sea creatures settle down and behave quite normally, quite naturally. It's only the small boys looking down from above that see the change in the environment.
(sotto) Yes, and they were collected by a slightly more sophisticated means than a bucket of water. But everything is relative, Jo.
Yes, well, don't worry about it. Right, stand by for blasting.
Shush. Right. Go and hide. (They duck down behind the settee. The Doctor checks the exact time that the monster roars, Claire screams and Daly wakes up.)
Hang on a minute, Jo. I'll get the magnetic core extractor.
Where's your scientific curiosity, Jo? Don't you want to know what's going on?
What is it now?
What is it, Jo?
Hey!
Up there.
Yes, the whole deckhead swings open.
Yes, and probably held in place by two tiny little wingnuts.
Relatively speaking. You saw the size of that hand.
That's what it looks like.
I told you this was no ordinary ship, Jo.
To find the Tardis, and that means finding a way off this ship.
Yes, very probably.
No, not while we're inside this thing. We've got to get out of here. Come on.
Oh, hello. Topping day, what?
Yes, ninety nine skidoo! Well, must press on. Pip pip, old chap.
You've asked us that question once before. Don't you remember?
You see, Jo. No memory traces at all.
You've forgotten our names.
I'm afraid so, old chap.
And I think I ought to warn you that I took lessons from
Queensbury rules?
Good afternoon.
Who's counting?
Let's try that door.
This way.
Hold it flat. Run it along the edge of the plate.
That's the idea.
No, you can't!
And here. That should do it. Yes.
Good. Down we go.
Just look at this filter circuit, Jo. What a beautiful piece of work. Now then, this must be the output and that must be the input through there. Let's have a look.
Yes, it is.
What is it? My dear girl, this is a perfect example of an early pulse mechanism based on the principal of caesium decay. Oh, this is absolutely vintage stuff.
Well, of course it isn't. I told you. We're no longer in the ship.
I've no idea. Probably outside this machine entirely. And just look at this, Jo. What a magnificent auxiliary capillary pump. Have you ever seen anything like it?
I've never been small enough to get inside one of these things before. It's fascinating! It's like walking around inside a wristwatch. It's wonderful. It really is magnificent.
We could try following this circuit. It'll probably run for miles though.
I don't know. Hold on, Jo!
Come on. Keep moving.
Come on, Jo, get up.
Come on, get yourself up. Come on, give us your hand. Come on, up. There. Here, mop yourself down with this.
Well, it just a bit hot, didn't it?
Who?
Well, why should they, Jo? We've done them no harm.
Look, one problem at a time, eh? Our problem is to find our way out of here. This looks quite promising. Let's try it, eh?
Right, come on now. Come on, quick as you can.
That's it. That's it. There.
No, no, no. All these shafts look very much alike.
Yes, you are right. We must have been this way before.
Of course we're not lost, Jo. What makes you think that? See this? You know what that is? That's a bearing housing for one of the ventilator shafts.
Yeah, I thought it might.
It means there should be an air duct around here somewhere.
Well, where's air ducted from, Jo?
Right first time.
Yes, I know. The trouble is we're inside the blueprint instead of looking down on it.
No, not this time, Jo. After all, we don't know what's behind this door, do we.
Yes, so do I.
Yes. Come on.
Yeah. Not quite what I expected, Jo. Hang on a minute, will you?
No, it's just the same.
Oh, some sort of marsh gas. Probably highly inflammable. Come on, we'd better take a look around.
Something's wrong, Jo.
No, neither do I.
I don't know, but it didn't sound very friendly.
It couldn't have seen us, Jo. It must be hunting by scent.
Us, I'm afraid. It's following our outward trail.
There's more than one of those things about, Jo. Let's go.
Come on, Jo!
But you must. We're nearly there.
Run for it, Jo!
It's no good. There's not enough gas.
No time to talk about that now, Jo. Let's get out of here. Come on!
Yes, I'm beginning to feel the century's myself.
No. I thought it was at first, though.
Yes. By jingo, I've got it! I know what this is.
We're in a miniscope!
Yes, you know, Jo, it's like, it's like one of those things, those glass cases that people keep colonies of ants in.
That's right, Jo, and you and I are inside its works.
Very probably.
No, not necessarily, Jo. Thoughtless, maybe.
Well, haven't you ever been to the zoo? Have you never kept goldfish in a bowl?
We are to those creatures up there, Jo. Roll up! Roll up! Roll up! And see these funny little creatures in their native habitat! Watch them go through their funny little tricks! Poke them with a stick and make them jump!
No. Oh no, believe me, I'm just as angry as you are. As a matter of fact, I had a great deal to do with the banning of these miniscopes.
Yes, I did. I managed to persuade the High Council of the Time Lords they were an offence against the dignity of sentient lifeforms.
Yes, well, they don't as a rule. But, frankly, I made such a nuisance of myself. Well, they banned the things.
I don't know. Officially, they were all called in and destroyed.
It looks like it. The Tardis must have materialised in its compression field.
Yeah, but not for long, Jo. We'll soon get out of here.
Come on, Jo. It's time we got out of here.
We've one advantage over them, Jo. We're smaller than them.
Yes, if we keep to the narrow sections, we can move faster.
Come on, quick. Down this way. Come on! Come on, give me your hand. Come on, that's it. That's the idea. Quick as you can.
Well, logically, there should be an extractor down there. Well, if I'd designed it, there would be one.
Yes. Persistent little beggars, aren't they?
I wonder?
Things do look a little difficult at the moment, I must admit.
Not impossible, Jo. Nothing's impossible. There's always an answer if you can find it.
Well, that's the trouble, finding it. Now I think this is the time for lateral thinking.
Well, instead of approaching the problem from head on, you approach it sort of sideways.
Yes, take our own particular example for a moment, eh? This is our problem. We can't go forward because this shaft is too steep. We can't go back the way we came because of our hungry little friends here.
Well, I didn't mean it quite so literally, Jo. If we move sideways, we'll find ourselves back on the ship.
I am?
Right, hang on a minute. Let's take a look at the plan.
Now, according to this plan, there should be a way back on the ship just around the corner. Come on.
Right, it's all clear. Come on.
About a dozen fathoms, I should think.
Ah, here's some here.
Come on.
No, man, don't! You'll blow us all to bits! Don't!
No, man, no!
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. That's done it.
Will you kindly stop referring to me as the creature, sir, or I may well become exceedingly hostile.
The tribunal is not deliberating. The tribunal is arguing. And quite nonsensically, if I may say so.
Will one of you kindly explain to me exactly where I am? Which planet, I mean?
Inter Minor? Not Metebelis Three, the famous blue planet of the Acteon galaxy?
I see. Oh, thank heavens the Tardis is safe, anyway.
Yes, it is indeed. And, oh yes, just as I thought. A miniscope. Now this is outrageous! Who is responsible for this device? Is it yours?
And you, sir, you are?
Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you, gentlemen, but you are all in very serious trouble.
You are, I take it, the representatives of authority on this planet?
Then you have allowed the importation and the operation of a machine that is expressly forbidden by intergalactic law.
But for the moment the machine is here and it is in operation. Surely you'll scarcely deny that?
Then you are responsible, are you not? As a direct result of your carelessness, my young companion is trapped inside this machine, in a situation of extreme peril.
If you will allow me to rescue my young companion, and give what help I can to the rest of the unfortunates trapped in here, then I am prepared to overlook the entire matter.
If not, then you'll just have to take the consequences. Let me know when you've made up your mind.
Thank you for your timely intervention, sir.
Just over there.
I beg your pardon?
I'm sorry.
I must apologise. I'm afraid I do not understand your language.
Are you a showman, sir?
Delighted, Miss Shirna. I am the Doctor.
Tell me, sir, are you in charge of this disgraceful device?
Yes, something is very wrong. I too have an assistant, you know, and she's trapped inside this machine. Now somehow I've got to get her out.
Drashigs?
What, lose them? That would be a tragedy.
Livestock? Let me tell you, sir, that the people inside that ship are human beings.
The collection of the simplest animal lifeforms is a dubious enough pursuit in itself, sir, but the collection of civilised intelligent beings is a positive crime. Now let me warn you that I intend to put an end to this shameful business.
Huh? What does that mean?
How long will it last?
Well, that means that every living creature in there will die, including my assistant! Now somehow, I've got to find a way of saving them.
Vorg?
Listen, Vorg, I shall need your help. I've got to get back inside this machine.
Well, it's the only way I can get Jo out of there in time and save the rest of your livestock. But I shall need you to trigger the settings for me.
Look, this is your machine, isn't it?
Then I presume you know how it works.
He what?
Yes, yes, I have seen something similar. You say you won this machine? And you haven't the faintest idea how it works? I see. Well, look, this Wallarian that you got it from, did he by any chance give you a green or a blue disc. A thing about this big?
Well go and have a look, will you? It's very important.
Well, it's simple, really. You see, the Scope's, er, omega circuit is broken. Now if I can link it to the Tardis and use that as the master, I can reprogramme the Scope.
Well, two things I hope. It'll enable me to get Jo out of here in time, and get her out of this wretched contraption, and it will return all the other lifeforms to their original space time coordinates.
I sincerely hope so, yes.
Yes, that's it. Thank heavens you kept it. Look, come with me and I'll tell you what I want you to do. Er, would you mind just waiting there for a moment?
Yes, of course it'll work.
Then don't touch any bare metal. Right, now listen to me. This is the phase one switch here. And this is the phase two. Now, don't touch the phase two until the last possible moment. Do you understand?
Good.
What's the ICCA?
Prison?
Oh yes, yes, very much so. Phase one.
Jo? Jo, is that you?
Look, stop asking silly questions and come on.
Come on, Jo.
Come on.
Come on, the circuits are going.
Come on, Jo! Come on, one last effort. We're nearly there.
Vorg. Vorg. The phase two switch.
Hello, Vorg. Well, you cut that a bit fine, didn't you?
It's all right, Jo. It's all right, Jo, we've made it.
Others?
Well, I reversed the original settings and linked them to the Tardis, so they should still be on the ship.
Yes, exactly.
I don't think we need worry too much about our friend Vorg.

Hello, Craig. I'm back.
How could who phone me? Nobody phoned me, I'm just here. Oh, you've redecorated. I don't like it.
Yes, that's it.
Social call. Thought it was about time I tried one out. How are you?
This is the bit where I say I'm fine too, isn't it? I'm fine, too. Good. Love to Sophie. Bye.
Something's wrong.
On your own, you said. But you're not. You're not on your own.
Increased sulphur emissions. And look at the state of this place. What are you not telling me?
Shush.
Shush!
No, you shush!
Whatever you are, get off this planet.
So when you say on your own
Human beings. No. Believe me, I've checked.
Same difference. Sometimes this works though. Shush.
Probably not.
At what?
So, what did you call him? Will I blush?
No, I didn't think you would.
Yes, he likes that, Alfie, though personally he prefers to be called Stormageddon, Dark Lord Of All.
That's what he calls himself.
I speak baby.
Yeah. He's wondering where his mum is? Where is Sophie?
No, he's your dad. You can't just call him Not Mum.
That's you. Also Not Mum, that's me. And everybody else is peasants. That's a bit unfortunate.
I just popped in to say hello.
I just want to see you, Craig! Cross my hearts. I've been knocking about on my own for a bit. Bit of a farewell tour. One last thing, popping in to see you, then I'm off to the Alignment of Exedor.
Seventeen galaxies in perfect unison. Meant to be spectacular. I can't miss it. Literally can't. It's locked in a time stasis field. I get one crack at flying my Tardis straight into it, if I get my dates right. Which I have.
So this is me, popping in and popping out again. Just being social. Just having a laugh. Never mind that.
Nothing.
Ooo, nope, given up all that. Done noticing things. I didn't even notice that, for example. Well, got to go. Good seeing you, Craig. Goodbye, Stormageddon.
No, it only works once, and only on life forms with underdeveloped brains.
Shush.
DOCTOR; Just go. Stop noticing. Just go. Stop noticing, just go. Stop noticing, just go. Stop it. Am I noticing? No. No, I am not. And what I am not doing is scanning for electrical fluctuations. Oh, shut up, you. I'm just dropping in on a friend. The last thing I need right now is a patina of teleport energy. I'm going. Do you hear me? Going. Not staying, going. I am through saving them. I am going away now.
It goes up tiddly up, it goes down tiddly down for only forty nine ninety nine, which I personally think is a bit steep, but then again it's your parents' cash and they'll only waste it on boring stuff like lamps and vegetables. Yawn!
Nobody panic, but I appear to be losing control.
Oops. Guys, guys, ladies and gentlemen. While I deal with this awkward moment, you go and find your parents slash guardians. Try in lamps. Craig!
I'm the Doctor. I work in a shop now. Here to help. Look, they gave me a badge with my name on in case I forget who I am. Very thoughtful, as that does happen.
Well, I was on my way, you know. Saw a shop, got a job. You got to live in the moment. Craig, mind Yappy.
Yappy. The robot dog. Not so much fun as I remember. You look awful.
Yeah, he did mention that he thought you were crying, too. He didn't get a wink. Yappy, say goodbye to Craig and Stormageddon. Goodbye, Craig. Goodbye, Stormageddon.
What was that?
Might not be.
No, you don't.
Sheila Clark went missing Tuesday. Atif Ghosh last seen Friday. Tom Luker last seen Sunday.
Oh, page one has an exclusive on Nina, a local girl who got kicked off Britain's Got Talent. These people are on pages seven, nineteen, twenty two. Because no one's noticed yet. They're far too excited about Nina's emotional journey, which in fairness, is quite inspiring.
These funny old power fluctuations which just happen to coincide with the disappearances.
Oh yes, that's it. Mystery solved. Wasting my time. Now, you can go home and I can go to Exedor. Goodbye.
And here's the lift.
Not any more. See? Here to help.
Oh, rubbish. Lifts aren't dangerous.
Quiet, Stormy. Oh, all right. There's more.
Just between you, me and Stormy, don't want to frighten me punters. Someone's been using a teleport relay right here in this shop. Missing people last seen in this area. Before you ask, CCTV's been wiped.
Exactly. Someone's been using a beam me up Star Trek teleport. Could be disguised as anything.
(strangled) Yes, that's it. That's all. It's the lights.
Like what?
Just keep looking at me, Craig. Right at me. Just keep looking.
Well, because, because, because I love you.
Yes, Craig. It's you. It's always been you.
Is that so surprising?
Yes, Craig. Yes, I am. Would you like that? Bit out of practice, but I've had some wonderful feedback.
Or we could just hold hands if it make you'd feel more comfortable.
Well, first of all, I don't really love you, except as a friend.
Quick reverse.
They must have linked the teleport relay to the lift, but I've fused it. They can't use that again. Stuck up there on their spaceship.
Cybermen.
It's got to be up there somewhere. Can't get a fix. It must be shielded.
No, no, no, I've just bought myself a little time. Still got to work out what they're doing before I can stop it.
Craig, take Alfie and go.
No?
Is that so?
Those were the days.
Craig. Craig. All right. All right, maybe those days aren't quite over yet. Let's go and investigate. I mean, there's no immediate danger now.
Good afternoon, Val.
Well, look round. Ask questions. People like it when you're with a baby. Babies are sweet. People talk to you. That's why I usually take a human with me.
You're my baby.
Partner. Yes, I like it. Is it better than companion?
You've not noticed anything unusual around here lately, Val?
Yes, yes?
Yeah. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all.
What?
A silver rat, glowing red eyes.
I bet they do.
Er, that'll be my partner with the er
Hello, everyone. Here to help.
Hello. Has anyone seen a silver rat? No. Okay. Long shot. I see you've met my friend, Craig. Nice uniform, George.
Shush.
No. Hold on. Un-shush. Shona?
Well, where did you last see her?
Would that I could, Craig.
Er, sorry, Madam. I'd try that in red if I were you.
Well, you love me, I've never excreted any weird alien gases at you.
Yes, I know. Course he does. Of course you do. We're partners.
Stormy thinks you should believe in yourself more.
Here. Right here. Last night. A Cyberman took Shona.
It's not a rat. It's a Cybermat.
Cybermats are infiltrators. Very small, very deadly. They collect power like bees collect pollen. One of them's been sucking the electrical energy from this area. But why a shop? You know, why not a nuclear power station?
Let's ask it. We wait for the shop to shut. We stake the place out and grab ourselves a Cybermat.
What is?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is not my fault, Craig.
It's his nappy. He's mentioned it twice.
There's a changing station over by Electrical Goods.
Craig! It's a coincidence. It happens. It's what the universe does for
Fun.
Amelia Pond.
Right, let's be having you then, Cybermat.
Shush.
No. It's a sonic screwdriver. Sonic equals sound. Take this. I got it on my discount, ten percent off. It's a papoose.
Alfie wants you attached to him. You are far too slow when he summons you.
Never. That's parenthood. Couldn't you have just got a babysitter? No, any babysitter. Doesn't have to be a hot one.
Well.
Shush.
It's okay.
Ah ha! That's very odd. It must be on low power. Or I'm better at that than I remember.
Yeah.
Yes, I know it is.
Stop screaming. Stop, stop screaming. Shush.
Come on!
George!
George
Oh, I've been, I've been chipped, chapped, chopped. The Cyberman. It killed George, took him back to the ship.
Yeah, I know what I said. I say a lot of things. But I fused the teleport. It should have taken them days to repair.
Oh, I should be dead, but the arm it chopped me with, it was damaged. Old spare parts. Must have changed those missing people.
A long story. I'm not exactly compatible. But why are they using spare parts? Why? Everything I find out makes less sense.
We've got a base? When did we get a base?
No.
Oh.
Hello, Stormageddon. It's the Doctor. Here to help. Shush. Hey. There, there. Be quiet. Go to sleep. Really. Stop crying. You've got a lot to look forward to, you know. A normal human life on Earth. Mortgage repayments, the nine to five, a persistent nagging sense of spiritual emptiness. Save the tears for later, boy-o. Oh, no. That was crabby. No, that was old. But I am old, Stormy. I am so old. So near the end.
You, Alfie Owens, you are so young, aren't you? And, you know, right now, everything's ahead of you. You could be anything. Yes, I know. You could walk among the stars. They don't actually look like that, you know. They are rather more impressive.
Yeah. You know, when I was little like you, I dreamt of the stars. I think it's fair to say in the language of your age, that I lived my dream, I owned the stage, gave it a hundred and ten percent. I hope you have as much fun as I did, Alfie.
Your dad's trying his best, you know. Yes, I know it's not his fault he doesn't have mammary glands. No, neither do I. Alfie, why is there a sinister beeping coming from behind me?
Oh, no you don't.
Come on, Alfie. Run! It's only stunned.
It's going to be okay. Good Alfie. Yes. Don't worry about anything. We're going to go outside.
Oops.
Come on, Craig, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
Craig? Don't worry. Alfie is fine. But on no account enter the house.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
He's safe. He's safe!
I think I can find the right frequency, shut it down again!
All right, all right, all right! Move!
Argh! Baking tray, Craig. Baking tray!
Hold it down!
Ah, it must be shielded from metastatic energy. Of course.
Don't worry, I have an app for that. Stand back. Stand back!
Success. That was amazing. You must be really, really strong. That thing should have had you easily.
Inactive, yes. Technically never been alive. It was playing possum before, to take us by surprise. Bravo.
And transmitting it up to the Cybership. But why? Why do they need power? Why are those conversions not complete yet, and what are they doing up there?
No, I had to wipe its brain. Now I can reprogram it and use it as a weapon against them.
No, after me.
After me. Because of me, you and Alfie nearly died. Do you still feel safe with me, Craig?
No. I am a stupid, selfish man. Always have been. I should have made you go. I should never have come here.
I put people in danger.
Craig, very soon I won't be here. My time is running out. I don't mean Exedor. Silence will fall when the question is asked. Don't even know what the question is. I always knew I'd die still asking. Thing is, Craig, it's tomorrow. Can't put it off any more. Tomorrow is the day I
Ah.
Safe mode. Clever me. Come along, Bitey.
Morning. Teleport's still fused. They didn't repair it. So, the Cyberman last night. How did it get down here, how did it get out? And why, why, am I asking you?
But where are the silver men?
Secondary teleport. No, there is no other teleport. They must have had a back-up system. Something complicated, something powerful, something shielded. Something like a door? A door! A disillium bonded steel door disguised as a wall.
That is cheating. So, it didn't teleport down, it climbed up.
Well, well, well. You have been busy.
Took me a while. Lot on my mind. Let's see. This ship crashed here centuries ago. No survivors, but the systems are dormant, waiting for power, and then the council stick a load of new cables right on top of you. Bitey wakes up and channels the power. You start crewing up from the shop as best you can. Not enough power, not enough parts.
What, the six of you?
Correct. And the Doctor always gives you a choice. Deactivate yourself, or I deactivate you.
Argh!
Craig, stop this. Get out!
Craig!
Craig, don't worry. I've reprogrammed their Cybermat. It'll drain their power.
No. Craig, fight it! They can't convert you if you fight back. You're strong. Don't give in to it.
Think of Sophie. Think of Alfie. Craig, don't let them take it all away.
Please, listen to me. I believe in you. I believe you can do this. I've always believed in all of you, all my life. I'm going die, Craig. Tomorrow, I'm going to die, but I don't mind if you just prove me right. Craig!
Alfie, I'm so sorry! Alfie, please, stop. I, I can't help him.
He can hear him. He can hear Alfie. Oh, please, just give me this. Craig, you wanted a chance to prove you're a dad. You are never going to get better one than this.
What's happening, you metal moron? A baby is crying. And you'd better watch out, because guess what? Ha ha! Daddy's coming home!
Yes, Craig.
Alfie needs you!
You've triggered a feedback loop into their emotional inhibitors. All that stuff they cut out of themselves, now they're feeling it. Which means a very big explosion.
They've sealed the ship!
I know!
The teleport!
That was another review. Ten out of ten.
No, that's impossible. And also grossly sentimental and over simplistic. You destroyed them because of the deeply ingrained hereditary human trait to protect one's own genes, which in turn triggered a, a, a. Yeah. Love. You blew them up with love.
The building should be totally safe structurally, and of course the bonded disillium contained the explosion.
I don't know. Shush.
Thank you for your help, Val. Good noticing. Keep them peeled.
Ah.
See, I do come back.
Time machine. But even with time travel, getting glaziers on a Sunday. Tricky.
What about you being in trouble with Sophie when she comes back? I couldn't let that happen.
DOCTOR; Course I did. You're my mate. I notice Stormageddon's very quiet and happy. Oh, he prefers the name Alfie now. And he's very proud of his dad.
Yes, of course he does now. Yeah, I know. He's a bit thick, isn't he?
Well, now it's time. I have to go.
Nobody can help me. I hope Sophie won't mind. I need these.
America.
I can't miss this appointment, Craig. Goodbye, mate.
Wow.
Oh, thanks.
Well then, old girl. One last trip, eh?
Hey. I'm the Doctor. I was here to help. And you are very, very welcome.

A woman.
Imagine you were dying. Imagine you were afraid and a long way from home and in terrible pain. Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, you looked up and saw the face of the devil himself. Hello, Dalek.
Hush, now. I need some information from your data core. Everything the Daleks know about the Silence.
Gideon Vandaleur. Get him. Now.
Father Gideon Vandaleur, former envoy of the Silence. My condolences.
Gideon Vandaleur has been dead for six months.
Can I speak to the Captain, please?
Hello again, the Teselecta time-travelling shape-changing robot powered by miniaturised people. Never get bored of that. Long time since Berlin.
They'll be fine if you behave. Now, this unit can disguise itself as anyone in the universe, so if you're posing as Vandaleur, you're investigating the Silence. Tell me about them.
One thing. Just one. Their weakest link.
The crowd are getting restless. They know the Queen is your only legal move, except you've already moved it twelve times, which means there are now over four million volts running through it. That's why they call it Live Chess. Even with the gauntlet you'll never make it to Bishop Four alive.
But I'm winning.
Information.
They're going to kill me too, very soon. I was just going to lie down and take it, but you know what? Before I go, I'd like to know why I have to die.
Dorium's dead. The Monks beheaded him at Demon's Run.
I hate rats.
Oh, good.
Why are some of them in boxes?
Thank you for bringing me, Gantok.
Gantok!
Well, I'm afraid they rather did, a bit.
Well
Because, in another reality, you and I are friends. And you sense that. Just as you sense there is something wrong with time.
Yes. I'm getting to her.
Hell, in high heels.
I need to know about the Silence.
And they want me dead.
That's okay, then. I was a bit worried for a minute there.
You know, you could've told me all this the last time we met.
What's so dangerous about my future?
Silence will fall when the question is asked.
I don't understand. What's it got to do with me?
Yes.
Of course.
Suppose there was a man who knew a secret. A terrible, dangerous secret that must never be told. How would you erase that secret from the world? Destroy it forever, before it can be spoken.
And silence would fall. All the times I've heard those words, I never realised it was my silence, my death. The Doctor will fall. Why are we here?
Why did we leave your office?
I think I've been running. Why do you have your revolver?
Yes. I think I am.
Why Lake Silencio? Why Utah?
Been running all my life. Why should I stop?
Not today.
Been knocking about. A bit of a farewell tour. Things to do, people to see. There's always more. I could invent a new colour, save the Dodo, join the Beatles. Hello, it's me. Get him. Tell him, we're going out and it's all on me, except for the money and driving. I have got a time machine, Dorium. It's all still going on. For me, it never stops. Liz the First is still waiting in a glade to elope with me. I could help Rose Tyler with her homework. I could go on all of Jack's stag parties in one night.
Well, it has never laid a glove on me! Hello?
Yes. Yes, I
Nothing. Nothing. It's just.
It's time. It's time.
It would involve crossing my own time stream. Best not.
Thank you.
I had to die. I didn't have to die alone.
Amy and Rory. The last Centurion and the girl who waited. However dark it got, I'd turn around, and there they'd be.
If it's time to go, remember what you're leaving. Remember the best. My friends have always been the best of me.
It would help if you didn't keep asking questions.
(sotto) We don't have much time.
Yes, she was there. River Song came twice.
Napoleon gave me this bottle. Well, I say gave. Threw. Salud!
Everything was in place. I only had to do one more thing. I only had to die.
You all need to stay back. Whatever happens now, you do not interfere.
Well, then. Here we are at last.
You're not supposed to. This has to happen.
I did run. Running brought me here.
I know. It's okay. This is where I die. This is a fixed point. This must happen. This always happens. Don't worry. You won't even remember this. Look over there.
That's you from the future, serving time for a murder you probably can't remember. My murder.
So that you know this is inevitable. And you are forgiven. Always and completely forgiven.
I can't.
Don't you dare. Goodbye, River.
What have you done?
But this is fixed. This is a fixed point in time.
No, they can't. Of course they can't. Who told you that
Nothing.
Nothing happened. And then it kept happening. Or, if you'd prefer, everything happened at once, and it won't ever stop. Time is dying. It's going to be five oh two in the afternoon for all eternity. A needle stuck on a record.
Said Winston Churchill.
We seem to be defending ourselves.
The creatures that lead the Silence. Remarkable beings. They're memory-proof.
You can't remember them. The moment you look away, you forget they were ever there.
Don't panic. In small numbers, they're not too difficult.
No! She's on our side. It's okay.
No. No, Amy. Amy, why are you wearing that?
Amy?
Amy Pond. Amelia Pond from Leadworth, please, listen to me. I know it seems impossible, but you know me. In another version of reality you and I were best friends. We, we travelled together. We had adventures. Amelia Pond, you grew up with a time rift in the wall of your bedroom. You can see what others can't. You can remember things that never happened. And if you try, if you really, really try, you'll be able to
Oh.
Oh.
You look wonderful.
Oh, Geronimo.
Okay, you can turn round now. How do I look?
Really?
Cool office though. Why do you have an office?! Are you a special agent boss lady? What's that mean? Not sure about the eye patch, though.
And you've got an office on a train. That is so cool. Can I have an office? Never had an office before. Or a train. Or a train slash office.
Okay. Hugging and missing now. Where's the Roman?
Mmm.
Apparently.
Well, it's not your fault. Time's gone wrong. Do you remember why?
Lake Silencio, Utah. I died.
Two different versions of the same event, both happening in the same moment. Time split wide open. Now look at it. All of history happening at once.
Time isn't just frozen, it's disintegrating. It will spread and spread and all of reality will simply fall apart.
Hello.
No.
Amy, you'll find your Rory. You always do. But you have to really look.
Oh, my Amelia Pond. You don't always look hard enough.
Time is still passing for me. Every explosion has an epicentre. I'm it. I'm what's wrong.
I'm still alive.
An eye patch. What for?
Yeah. I've encountered them before. Always wondered what they looked like.
The Silence have human servants. They all wear these.
Yeah, they would.
That was another reality. What are the tanks for?
Me neither.
Captain Williams, nice fellow. What's his first name?
Just give us a moment. Just need to check something, Ma'am.
The loyal soldier, waiting to be noticed. Always the pattern. Why is that?
Your boss, you should just ask her out. She likes you. She said so.
Oh, she just sort of generally indicated.
She said that you were a Mister Hottie-ness, and that she would like to go out with you for texting and scones.
No, I haven't.
Yes. Yes.
Hi, honey. I'm home.
Did my best, dear. I showed up. You just can't get the psychopaths these days. Love what you've done with the pyramids. How did you score all this?
I always thought so.
What did she say?
Did you?
It's not funny, River. Reality is fatally compromised. Tell me you understand that.
I don't have the time. Nobody has the time, because as long I'm alive, time is dying. Because of you, River.
Oh, you love me, do you? Oh, that's sweet of you. Isn't that sweet. Come here, you.
I'm sorry, River. It's the only way.
Oh, why do you always have handcuffs? It's the only way. We're the opposite poles of the disruption. If we touch, we short out the differential. Time can begin again.
And time won't fall apart. The clocks will tick. Reality will continue. There isn't another way.
Idle gossip.
Same thing.
I don't want to marry you.
This is no fun at all.
The pyramid above us. How many Silence do you have trapped inside it?
What do you mean?
DOCTOR; Help her! Help her!
Eye drives off now. Remove them.
We could stop this right now, you and I.
Amy, tell her.
There's no point. There's nothing you can do. My time is up.
Then people are dying for me. I won't thank you for that, Amelia Pond.
What's this? Oh, it's as timey-wimey distress beacon. Who built this?
But that's all you've got, a distress beacon.
River! River, this is ridiculous. That would mean nothing to anyone. It's insane. Worse, it's stupid. You embarrass me.
River, no one can help me. A fixed point has been altered. Time is disintegrating.
But I have to die.
River, you and I, we know what this means. We are ground zero of an explosion that will engulf all reality. Billions on billions will suffer and die.
More than every living thing in the universe?
River, River, why do you had have to be this? Melody Pond, your daughter. I hope you're both proud.
Amy, uncuff me now. Okay, I need a strip of cloth about a foot long. Anything will do. Never mind.
River, take one end of this. Wrap it around your hand, and hold it out to me.
As you're told. Now, we're in the middle of a combat zone, so we'll have to do the quick version. Captain Williams, say I consent and gladly give.
Just say it. Please.
Need you to say it too, mother of the bride.
Now River, I'm about to whisper something in your ear, and you have to remember it very, very carefully, and tell no one what I said.
I just told you my name. Now, there you go, River Song. Melody Pond. You're the woman who married me. And wife, I have a request. This world is dying and it's my fault, and I can't bear it another day. Please, help me. There isn't another way.
I'll make it a good one.
And you are forgiven. Always and completely forgiven.
Actually, thinking about it
Look into my eye.
The Teselecta. A Doctor in a Doctor suit. Time said I had to be on that beach, so I dressed for the occasion. Barely got singed in that boat.
It's the only way, then they can all forget me. I got too big, Dorium. Too noisy. Time to step back into the shadows.
Her days, yes. Her nights? Well, that's between her and me, eh?
Well, you're not exactly going anywhere, are you?
Goodbye, Dorium.

That is what I'm trying to find out, Zoe.
We can't be.
Ah there we are. What in heavens name?
Just a minute, just a minute. Oh this control is. There we are. Now that, that's an ion-jet rocket of the twenty first century, but, this helmet, if I can. There we are. That's not nearly so sophisticated. It's certainly not later than 1960.
Of course!
Just a minute.
Yes, I think that explains it.
Hmm? Well it's a flying machine, designed by a gentleman by the name of Leonardo Da Vinci in about 1500.
We're in a museum!
A space museum! Look, there you are.
A balloon.
That's a transport plane. And, now those initials, they stand for Russia. That's Gagarin, the first Earthman in space. Look.
Come on. Let's have a look round, shall we?
Just a minute. Wait for me.
Oh, my word.
Yes. My word, Jamie, look at that.
Very large.
Now, Zoe.
Shush, Jamie, I'm trying to listen.
Jamie, I think that's just a tiny bit
Now just listen, there really is no need for all these histrionics. We are perfectly harmless.
Oh well, the usual way. We just materialised.
Well, this is a museum.
Well, yes, in a way.
Zoe, I think we do owe this gentleman an apology. We really are most interested in the museum, Mister?
Yes, but there's no need to threaten us, you know.
Laugh? You mean people laugh at all this? Why, it's a magnificent exhibition.
No, of course not. We haven't come to take anything. We genuinely are interested in space travel. Why, especially a thing like this. This is superb.
You mean this model's been abandoned? But it's speed and stability concept alone, it's a tremendous advance in rocket design.
I'll give you an hand, here we are. Oh yes, this is superb. My word.
I see. And these must be the secondary electrode accelerators.
That was awkward. What did you do about that?
What have we go here? Ah, blueprints!
But surely rockets would still be useful as an auxiliary means of transport, wouldn't they? Besides, how would man get beyond the moon?
I see. So you lost government backing?
Well, I can understand your bitterness. Very short-sighted of the government to put all their eggs in one basket.
Well.
Oh, how do you do. This is Zoe, and Jamie, and I'm the Doctor.
Professor, listen to them.
In a way this is a triumph for your rocket.
Yes, or by a few million miles. I'm afraid the Tardis is not suited to short-range travel.
Yes. I think I could get your rocket to the moon.
Yes, I have considerable experience in space travel, and so have my two companions.
Well, perhaps you're overestimating the difficulties. How much more work is required on your rocket?
Well, we're willing to help, as I've said.
Yes?
Jamie, I hadn't thought about you.
But surely it's only a question of getting to the moon. We shall come back by T-Mat, won't we?
I'm sure it will.
Oh yes, and even if I don't, Zoe has total recall.
There's no need, we.
Now don't worry about a thing. Your rocket is going to be in good hands.
That's quite enough, Jamie.
Yes, well we've taken (conversation carries on in background)
Now don't worry, Miss Kelly. We're going to be perfectly all right.
All normal.
Yes?
Oh yes, I know. We're to re-establish video link with the Earth.
Right. We're ready when you are.
Yes. You remember your take off briefing, Jamie?
There's one minute to go. Now hold tight, everyone.
Yes, I think there must be a fault in one of the circuits.
Well, one of the circuits has burnt out, Zoe. I'll switch to a secondary one.
Oh dear, this is most unfortunate.
Well I had hoped we could stay in contact with Earth.
It works off a different power source, Jamie. Solar power. It's independent of the T-Mat system.
Well, lets try, shall we? I think we're near enough. There, that's our activating signal.
I know, I know. I'm trying to re-activate it.
Well, the solar power source must have been damaged, Jamie.
Yes. Without the beam it'll be impossible to land safely.
Just a minute. I think I'm getting something.
Hello, Moonbase. Can you hear me?
We're not on the Earth. We're in a rocket orbiting the moon.
Well I can assure you it's not impossible. What is your emergency? What's happening on Moonbase?
How much longer, Zoe?
Let's hope he can still transmit.
It's not his equipment I'm worried about, it's his survival.
How much did you hear?
Yes, yes. Jamie and I have met them before. They come from the planet Mars.
Mars is a dying planet. I imagine they're trying to find a new home.
Oh, I think that that's just a stepping stone.
Yes. Well Mars, as you know, is a cold planet. They've adapted to that. It's heat they can't stand.
Hello Moonbase, hello Moonbase. Can you read me?
Oh thank heavens for that. Now listen. We need your help to make a landing.
We can't do that. We've lost radio contact with the Earth.
We can't do that either. We haven't got enough fuel. We need to get to the fuel dump on the moon.
Oh well, we'll just have to take that risk. Now, where are you Mister, er, what's?
Did you hear that? We want you to keep your transmitter going.
There, I think that's done it. Now then, let's see if we can pick up his signal.
Yes. Yes, there we are. Now, Zoe, what about the approach trajectory?
Ah good. Oh yes. Oh, I don't think I could have done better myself.
What? Well, landing positions, everyone.
Don't worry, Jamie. I'm sure we're going to be all right.
Hello Moonbase. Yes, we can. We are coming in on your signal now. Whatever you do, keep transmitting.
The signal! It's stopped!
No! No, I shall have to get us down as best I can.
Well, I'll try. Yes, yes, there it is. Oh, my word. I think we're going to be all right.
Yes, well, I'm sorry about the landing. Is everyone all right?
Yes.
Well, the first we must do is to refuel. You can see to that, Zoe, can't you.
Well I must go in search of Mister Phipps.
Oh, I've met them before.
Well I've got to rescue Mister Phipps, now haven't I? Now where did I put that map of. Ah. Here we are. Now then, the Solar Power room is. Here we are. Oh yes. Oh yes, that seems to be quite a simple route.
No. You'll stay here and look after Zoe. Now don't worry, you're going to be quite all right.
Good luck.
Hello?
Oh! Oh, Mister Phipps, I presume?
From the rocket. We were talking on the radio.
No, they're still in the rocket. How many of the Ice Warriors are there?
Yes.
Oh, they have their weak points.
I see. Well, there's only one thing for it. We shall have to destroy T-Mat.
Yes. Have you refuelled the rocket, Jamie?
Oh good. I have found Mister Phipps.
Oh, he's quite all right but
Yes, eventually, Jamie, but I've got to put T-Mat out of action first.
Now, don't worry. Jamie. You and Zoe prepare the rocket for take off and wait for us. Goodbye.
Where is this leading to?
It's an Ice Warrior. It's got Miss Kelly. But how?
Run!
Stop!
You've got no orders to kill me. Your leader will want to speak to me!
But I can be useful to you, like Fewsham. Your leader will be angry if you kill me. I'm a genius.
I might ask you the same question.
Our resources are not limited to T-Mat, you know.
But you can't be sure of that, can you? The people of the Earth may be preparing a whole fleet of rockets to defend themselves with.
And what are your plans? Invasion by T-Mat? There are too few of you to conquer all the peoples of the Earth.
Why are you helping them?
Do you know what is in that container?
Then I shall have to have a look inside, and you are going to help me.
(sotto) All right, Fewsham. Now.
You have got to help me.
Very well, I shall do it by myself. If I'm caught, which is most likely, we will both get killed.
What are these things? (he picks one up) They look like seed pods.
Oh, Victoria, Jamie.
Oh, well done, Jamie.
Yes, I think so. Oh, I'm a bit dizzy. It's so hot in here.
What? Well, where are they now?
Ah, Zoe!
Yes, I think so.
Well, do I gather we can get back to Earth then?
But if we're all going, who is going to dispatch us?
Oh, I see. How ingenious.
Righto. Jamie, Zoe, come along. I think this could be quite fun, you know.
You know, I find T-Mat travel rather disappointing. There's no sensation at all.
Ah.
Well
Please! Let us answer one question at a time.
Jamie, I am not surprised. They have taken over the whole of the Moonbase.
He should be back.
What? But he said he was going to repair it.
Then why did he let us escape?
But don't you see gentlemen? The invasion of Moonbase, the taking over of T-Mat, the seed pods, the arrival of the Ice Warrior. They're all part of the same plan.
Well, I'm not sure yet. Have your people been able to make anything of it?
Yes, but have you tried to understand it?
I'm only suggesting that instead of trying to destroy it, you find out it's composition and purpose.
Good. Then we must find a sample.
Fine. Then there's no time to be lost.
Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.
Yes, it's organic. It's alive. Definitely a fungus composition.
You're sure that this is correct?
A molecule of five atoms absorbs oxygen. You know, a complete blanket of this would reduce the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere quite drastically.
It would make the atmosphere of the Earth uninhabitable to the human race, but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars.
Look at that. Even without vegetation to feed on, it's still active.
Oh!
Just a minute, there must be some way of
Sulphuric acid. Hydrochloric acid. Acetic acid.
Is Commander Radnor there, please? Ah, Zoe! Is Radnor there?
Oh, I see. Zoe, it's the most wonderful news. We've found a way of destroying the fungus.
Water. Ordinary water!
There's no time to explain now. Apparently there is a Weather Control Bureau somewhere. I want you to get in touch with them.
Well, no. No, I've tried, but they're not answering or it's broken down or something.
Well, get in touch with Commander Radnor and ask him to get hold of the Weather Control Bureau people and to make rain. As much rain as possible over the entire country.
Right. The Professor and I are coming back now.
Bye.
The sound, can you turn it up?
Commander Radnor, can this be recorded?
Well quickly, man. It's vital!
Cancel the launch!
We can use that satellite to mislead the Martian invasion fleet.
Well, don't you see? Poor Fewsham deliberately let us overhear their homing signal. We can imitate that signal with a homing device of our own in the satellite!
If we can deflect their armada, half our battle is won.
Well, haven't you already done that? Haven't you been in touch with the Weather Control Bureau?
But I sent you a message over an hour ago. Didn't Zoe reach you?
Oh, I see. Well, perhaps Zoe went to the Weather Control people herself?
What?
Zoe! Are you in there? Zoe!
Zoe! Jamie! Let me in!
Zoe! Jamie! Zoe!
Oh no!
Zoe!
Let me in! Zoe! Jamie!
Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in! Oh, no!
Are you in there, Jamie!
Jamie, open the door!
Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in!
Oh no!
Jamie, Zoe, open this door!
Jamie? Zoe?
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my word!
What? Where are we going?
Oh, my word. Oh, that was a dangerous situation!
What? What about Jamie?
Oh. no. We must help him.
What?
Jamie!
I don't think he's stayed in there, Jamie. Come on!
No, Jamie, I think this is just the place.
Solar energy room. That means that's a radiation door. Now, if I can find the control.
It must be here somewhere.
Ah, wait a minute.
No, Jamie! (switches the lights on again) It must be one of these.
Ah! There we are. It's got 'shut' on it.
Get back!
Well, it should hold for a little while, Jamie.
Well, Commander Radnor's sending some security guards.
Solar energy. Reflectors, of course! Well, we ought to be able to rig something up here.
Is this the sort of thing that Phipps rigged up, Zoe?
I think you'll find that this will be better for
Yes, yes. Open the door.
The only way to find out is to try, Jamie. Now open the door.
It's gone.
Another moment and we could have destroyed him. There's some more HD cable there.
You reel it out and I'll make the connections.
Yes, yes, that's it, Jamie. Hurry up.
Zoe, stand by to throw the switch. Jamie, play out the cable.
Now, Zoe!
All right, Zoe!
T-Mat control? Commander Radnor? Ah.
This is the Doctor.
Yes, well, we've had quite a battle here, but things are all right now. There was a warrior here, but we've dealt with him.
Well, yes, I'm afraid so. I'm going to see how much now. How are you getting along with the signal in the satellite?
Good. I'll be back as soon as I can.
I'm not so sure, Jamie. After all, it's only the controls that are damaged. The workings are all right. If we can bypass the controls. Have you got your knife on you?
Lend it me, will you?
That's it, thank you.
There we are. Now, what have we got here? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, well, it's just a question of sorting this lot out, that's all.
Right, now then, Zoe, let's see what happens when we try to connect these two together. (they spark.) No, I don't think so, somehow. What about these two? (no sparks so he twists the ends together) Ah, that's better. I think I've succeeded in re-establishing one of these rain circuits, Jamie.
Oh, Jamie. Weather control is a very difficult technology. You can't expect immediate results.
Well, I hope so, Zoe. Just have to hope for the best, that's all. I must get on because there's another little job that I want to do.
Well, I want to make some alterations to my solar energy device.
With any luck, we should have some nice heavy rain before long. Ah, there we are.
Well done.
Yes, Miss Kelly?
There isn't going to be a right one. There's only going to be ours, the wrong one, and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet into an orbit around the sun.
Oh, obviously that has to be stopped.
Well, as soon as the satellite is up, I shall T-Mat myself to the moon and destroy their homing device.
Oh, I don't think so. I've rigged up a rather interesting little device here.
Well, it's a development of the solar energy device that you so successfully used on the moon, only I've succeeded in rendering it portable. I've got a solar battery.
Well, that means that their invasion fleet is getting closer. There's not time to be lost. Now, are you quite clear? As soon as I have succeeded in destroying their signal you must activate our signal in the satellite.
Right, then I'll be off.
Yes? What is it, Zoe?
Don't worry, Zoe, I will. Are you ready, Miss Kelly?
Then now's the time to test it.
Well, you weren't very successful, were you.
Well, you don't expect me to tell you that, do you?
Yes. I'm afraid you were a little too quick for me.
Oh no, I don't think I could
Well, well yes, perhaps I could get the hang of it.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yes, but they haven't arrived yet, have they. Something still might go wrong, you know.
There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.
Yes. That signal has been going no further than this control room.
Not your signal. Ours.
We sent up a satellite. That signal has sent your fleet into a false orbit.
You tried to destroy an entire world.
No, I'm afraid that you've failed there too. We can destroy the fungus.
Jamie, look out!
Jamie, a live terminal!
Oh, well done, Jamie! Oh, goodness me! Jamie, thank you very much. Now then, we must T-Mat ourselves back to Earth.
But, Zoe, of course I did!
Oh, Jamie, sometimes I think you're never satisfied.
Well, you know, questions, explanations. It's very difficult. Come on.
I heard that, Jamie. Come on.

Well I told you it was a bit swampy. It's not the Tardis' fault, anyway. These marshes go on for miles. A little water doesn't hurt.
Yes, well, we won't be here long enough to need K9. Come on.
Gravity check. Escape velocity about one point five miles a second.
Yes. This must be one of the moons of Delta Magna.
I'd say the third.
Never mind about that. Just point the tracer and see where we go next.
Forty two and a half degrees?
No.
Yeah, or else the tracer's developed a fault.
Yes, why don't you try the higher ground there.
Romana? Romana?
Not quite. You shot the wrong man's hat, though. Fancy taking me for Rohm-Dutt.
Well, a sort of survey. I've lost my friend.
Something must have happened to her. Look at the way those reeds are crushed.
Swampies? Are they the local tribes here?
Listen, how do I get in touch with these Swampies?
No, no, no, no. I'm looking for my friend. You see, she's important to me.
Fine. Shush. Will there be strawberry jam for tea?
You should put up the usual notices. Trespassers will be shot. Who is Rohm-Dutt?
No, I'm new here.
I told you, looking for my friend.
What classified project?
What, this? A methane catalysing refinery, classified?
What? Well, of course I know what it is. I've seen hundreds of them.
You Earth colonists are always so insular. If you'd been to Binaca-Ananda, you'd see one in every town.
Yes.
I have my own transport.
Will you stop saying that? What gives him an insight into my mental processes?
That's an air vent.
It's a funicular gas separator.
Well, it looks to me like a primitive enzyme recycler, with an injection circuit feeding the bacterium bioplast. I imagine that the raw protein is centrifuged before being freeze-dried and compressed for packaging. I think you'd find it more efficient if you inserted a plasmin catalyst ahead of the bioplast circuit.
Yeah, why not?
Am I free to go now?
Oh.
Right. A sort of mineralogical survey. Look, I've got to go and find my friend.
Orbit shot?
Ah.
Very sensible.
And just the six of you here?
Oh no, I make it six. One, two, three
Doesn't he count?
Ah. Why are his friends attacking you?
In any case, a lake that size couldn't possibly support ten full scale refineries.
Oh. Then you must have an alternative source of methane feedstock.
Ah. Tell me, where were your men when they were killed?
What? Oh, I don't know. Just curious.
What happened?
Then they might just have been drowned.
Well, anyone can make a mistake.
What, teach them to carry trays?
Well, progress is a very flexible word. It can mean just about anything you want it to mean.
Hello.
Well, if you've seen one orbit shot, you've seen them all.
Are they having a dance?
Who's Kroll?
Yes, but just the same, a blood sacrifice. I don't like the sound of that.
What? Look, I have a shrewd idea who it is that might be being sacrificed, and Romana's not the easiest of guests.
There's no need for you to be involved.
Well, he probably looked more convincing from the front.
I'm not smug.
Sucker marks.
Look, sucker marks. Pretty ancient, too, by the way the erosion's
Oh, they've told you about their local water deity, have they?
Yeah, or to his memory. Kroll was brought here hundreds of years ago. He must be dead by now.
Don't talk to me about politics.
I wonder where they found that. Look, it's a genuine antique.
Are you all right?
What?
What! I picked it up.
No, no, no, no. It would be extremely foolhardy trying to cross the swamp in the dark, would it not.
I don't think so. They're more likely to be digging trenches.
They expect to be attacked at any moment.
Yes. I followed a Swampie carrying vital information.
Well. Shush.
Well, it wasn't too difficult. The technicians at the refinery were so busy trying to find an excuse to start a massacre, I just slipped away.
It's a primitive methane catalysing refinery. A pilot plant for bigger things, they hope.
The Earth colonists from Delta Magna. They're the ones who shipped the little green men up here.
That's right. Of course, that was all a long time ago.
Precisely.
Yes. I wouldn't have thought it was worthwhile, but they're producing a hundred tons of compressed protein twice a day.
Yes, they're sending it back to Delta Magna in orbit shot capsules.
I don't know, I haven't discovered that yet. But they're producing it, and in sufficient quantities to make it worth fighting over.
Rohm-Dutt? So Thawn was right about the guns. I wonder.
Well, who's paying Rohm-Dutt? I mean, they obviously don't use money here.
At the bottom of that shaft there'll be an underground passage. I wonder where it leads to?
So do I.
I think it's an illustrated history of the tribe. A sort of Bayeux tapestry with footnotes.
I think it's atrociously writ, but the pictures aren't bad. Look. That shows them being evicted from Delta Magna.
That's right, yes. They were given this moon as a sort of reservation. Look, there you are. There's Kroll in his aquarium. What did I tell you? Sucker marks.
Hmm? Let me see. And Kroll. When Kroll awakened, he saw that the people were fat and indolent, and then Kroll became angry and he struck them down, swallowing into him the symbol of his power and killing all who were in the temple, even Hajes the priest. Great was the lamentation of the people but Kroll returned to the water and slept.
Thus was the third manifestation of Kroll. Well, he's obviously one of those monsters who's not always about the place.
Yeah. Still, a dormancy period of that length would indicate a creature of massive size.
Well, does it matter? Hmm? Does it really matter? You know what I think? I think that Kroll's still around and he's just about due for his fourth manifestation.
Yeah. Let's get out of here. Come on!
I told them they had their figures wrong, but of course I didn't know about Kroll then.
The refinery. There can't be enough sediment in that place to produce the volume of methane they claim to have found, so where's it coming from?
What?
Yes. And Thawn's men vanished while they were taking methane samples, drilling into the sediment.
Yes. Right. Got it! The refinery's heat exchangers must have raised the lake temperature by several degrees already
And the noise of their orbit shot is rousing Kroll!
What?
What? Well, you'd better introduce me.
Oh, I don't know. As a wise and wonderful person who wants to help. Don't exaggerate.
I told you not to exaggerate.
Who's that?
Ah.
No. Probably the usual things. Fire, water, hanging upside down over a pit of vipers.
You see? The weight of history's against you.
I know a rogue when I see a rogue, and I've no desire to die in the company of a rogue, have you? Have you any desire to die in the company of a rogue?
I know that feeling.
Here comes the verdict.
Seven's my lucky number.
Wasting his breath.
He's not the Great One. He's the Insignificant One. If you're going to have someone imitate Kroll, it ought to be more convincing.
What?
So Kroll's on the move. I've less time than I thought.
I don't remember that last night. Early Samoan influence?
Interesting how traces of old cultures survive, isn't it?
Well, that's understandable at your age. Still, I prefer it to Gothic Perpendicular.
You know, that window's quite out of place. It's not in character at all.
Well, architecture's quite a serious subject. Skart, where did that window come from?
What? That window up there.
I'd have sacked him.
The architect.
Did I tell you about the time I was a child?
It was a question about
Ah! And snaps our spines. How ingenious. Now I know the purpose of the window.
What is, what?
Well, he didn't do much for you last time, did he. Killing the High Priest and swallowing the Symbol of Power.
Why don't you just let the whole thing drop, Ranquin? You've made your point.
Oh, you're not leaving. Aren't you going to stay and watch?
It's even more unpleasant to experience. Ranquin, what was the secret of Kroll's power?
I've read about it somewhere.
Yes, I know Kroll has it now, but what was it?
Yes, but what was the power?
Your people were evicted from their homeland, Ranquin. You had no choice.
I like to get things straightened out.
He's got narrow little eyes. You can't hypnotise people with narrow little eyes.
Yes, trying to persuade him to untie us. Our only chance.
I don't know the contraction rates of creeper, or the breaking point of bones and ligament.
Sorry you didn't stay on Delta Magna now, eh? Who paid you to bring the natives guns?
And who do they think brought them?
Why the Sons of Earth?
No, no, no, no, shush. Why did Thawn want to discredit the Sons of Earth?
No, no, no, no, that's a very good questions. After all, none of them can ever have seen the Earth.
Imagination.
Don't give up. Don't give up. How are you doing, Rohm-Dutt?
Stretching's good for the spine. Well, up to a point.
I think we're in for a storm.
No, no, no, no. Electrical storms on planetary satellites can be quite spectacular.
Ha, ha. Just relax your muscles.
What we need are hailstones big as bricks.
I'll try a pitch higher.
Nellie Melba's party piece, though she could only do it with wine glasses.
Come on. Pull, Rohm-Dutt, pull! We've got to stretch these creepers while they're still wet. Come on, pull! Pull! Another foot. Come on! Come on. You too, Romana, pull. Pull! Pull!
There you are. Now you all know what it's like to be within an inch of death.
Patience, patience. Another minute won't hurt.
Feet out!
Come on.
This is no time to start talking about noses.
Listen, if it's an anxiety you want, look. The storm will be easing shortly and the Swampies will be coming out from under their umbrellas. Let's get out of here. Come on!
One slip here and you're up to your neck. Next bit of firm ground's there. We'll have to jump.
Well, there's no other way of getting across.
No. Here.
Not much further now.
Shush. We're being hunted.
Freeze. Don't even move an eyebrow.
Well, I told him not to move. It hunts by surface vibrations. Primarily a vegetarian, of course, but over the years it's learnt that anything that moves is wholesome.
Come on.
Hold tight.
Freeze.
Yes.
Yes, wasn't it. Let's get out of here before it changes its mind.
It looks like it. Let's see if there are any survivors, shall we? Shush.
What? Back to the rocket silo. If he fires off that orbit shot, there'll be nothing left of the Swampies, or Kroll. Come on.
Thawn's using the override firing mechanism. There must be some way of disconnecting it.
What is it?
Yes. We'd better say goodbye now. Goodbye.
Get out of here, Romana. Just get out.
Just get out!
Get out.
When in doubt, cut everything.
Simple, really.
What? Oxygen starvation.
Blacked out for a few seconds.
Yeah, well, I needed the rest. Did you say minutes? Come on!
What? If we're caught loitering outside of here, they'll put two and two together
You're putting two and two together. I can tell by the expression on your face that you're putting two and two together.
Well, I remembered that I forgot to say goodbye. This is Romana.
Well, I was closing the blast room door. It shouldn't be left open like that.
Well, I, maybe your cleaning, I don't suppose you do have a cleaning lady here.
Ah, haven't you forgotten something?
Shouldn't you say don't make any sudden moves?
I don't think that was necessary.
Oh look, it's coming this way.
Well, I don't think it's come to shake hands.
Shush. Maybe it's saving you for pudding.
No, no, no, we surrender, we surrender.
What do we get this time? The eighth Holy Ritual?
All baloney. Kroll couldn't tell the difference between you and me and half an acre of dandelion and burdock.
Oh, I don't know. Ask Ranquin, he's the Kroll expert.
Hey? Is that your considered opinion? You know something, Romana? I think that if we
Romana!
Romana, come back!
Don't go near that window!
The door!
What, doesn't know we're here? It's making some pretty shrewd guesses.
Fenner, Fenner, can you operate the centrifuge?
Switch it on. Come on, switch it on.
Noise, Fenner, noise. The Kroll hunts by sensing vibrations. Give it something to think about.
Shush, shush.
Yes, but for how long?
Everything you've got, Fenner. All the noise you've got. That's it, keep it busy.
Here.
To test a theory. All theories have to be tested sometime, and this seems as good as any. You stay here in case I'm wrong.
The Symbol of Kroll's power.
Well, I've had a happy life. Can't complain. Nearly seven hundred and sixty. Not a bad age.
The fifth segment!
Well, it is a bit difficult to explain.
What?
Oh, don't worry about that, Fenner. You won't be needing the firing bay any more. No more Kroll, no more methane, no more orbit shots. Ha ha!
Ah. And with the firing bay already blocked
Disconnected in the gantry.
What, in fifty seconds?
Forty seconds. There's only one thing to do!
Hold that.
Let's hope these are the right ones. Stand back, everybody, stand back.
Hmm?
I think so.
Yes.
Yes. Time to say goodbye. Come on, Romana, let's go.
Oh yes, we have, yes. Listen, Fenner, someone will come here and pick you up. Stay here for a while. Lead a natural life. You might even get to like it. Teach Varlik and his friends how to do a replacement for Kroll, maybe.
I'm coming!
I think it's this way.
No, no, come on. You know I've got an unerring sense of direction. I have.
I think it's this way.
Come on!
Yes?
Well, it all added up. I mean, the obvious disguise for the segment was the Symbol of Power, and that wasn't around any more.
That's right, along with the High Priest. Of course, it wasn't so big in those days. Kroll, I mean. Just an ordinary giant squid. Hello.
No, no, look.
Cellular regeneration.
There must be hundreds of those around now.
No, no, no, no, not bits of Kroll. No, they'll just be ordinary giant squids. Nothing to worry about. Unless, of course, you're a High Priest. There'll never be another Kroll. It was the segment that did it.
Get back, K9! Get back.

You must read this, Adric. The Black Orchid.
It's fascinating. Such scholarship.
What's the matter?
Why?
Oh, no one thinks that.
Well, everyone's teased from time to time.
That's not true.
Time? We have spent many hours discussing and debating endless topics.
All right, I'll make more time.
I give you my word.
That's not fair.
Have you quite finished?
Well, it can wait!
No, Adric, I will not do it!
The Tardis is not designed for E-space! Nyssa, tell him!
He wants to go home!
And that would involve the Tardis going back into E-space.
How do you calculate negative coordinates?
It would also involve passing through the CVE. Now, you can't calculate random coordinates.
You do not have the Monitor's skill, Adric, and even if you did, I am not going back into E-space!
E-space is another universe. There isn't a taxi service goes back and forth.
Do you really think I'd be making all this fuss if it weren't?
Oh, help yourself. I'm not waiting around while you plot the course to your own destruction.
Earth.
Twenty sixth century.
Thank you.
Why not? Adric wants to use the computer, I want to go for a walk.
You see?
I'm going outside now. I might be gone some time.
So peaceful and cool down here.
All right, but I'm not taking him back into E-space, and that's my final word on the matter.
All right, I'll look, but I'm not promising anything.
Now, look here, Adric
What?
Phosphorescence.
Hmm?
Fascinating!
An amazing species.
You should be proud if they were.
They were also the most successful creature ever to inhabit the Earth.
Fossilised remains have been found all over the planet. Not bad adaptation for a creature with a brain the size of a pea.
Hundred million years or so. They seemed so secure and yet they died out virtually overnight.
Initially hypothermia, then starvation.
Something equally as devastating. The Earth collided with something from space.
Could be. I don't know. I've always meant to slip back and find out.
It's size. It was gigantic.
The impact would have caused millions upon millions of tons of earth and rock to be fragmented and then hurled up into the atmosphere, enveloping the whole planet.
To such an extent that the surface temperature would have dropped radically.
Sixty five million years.
Primitive, Tegan. Very primitive.
Er, I don't think we should go any further.
How do you do. I'm the Doctor. This is Tegan and Nyssa.
What are we supposed to have done?
Anything we can do?
Obviously not.
What bodies?
We've only just arrived.
I know nothing about it.
I can't.
Nyssa.
Androids. That's why they didn't register on your scanners.
No. If you want proof, you'll find they'll kill me as willingly as they'll kill you. See what I mean?
Do you know why?
Whoever's controlling the android thinks there is.
Yes, they will, but you must concentrate your fire.
No, it's only damaged.
Undoubtedly.
Waiting.
Were you working near the rockfall the first time you were attacked?
Well, maybe their function is to protect that hatch.
Let's find out.
Oh, they're just like people.
Which can be their weakness.
Adric!
Brave heart, Tegan. Now, the androids are programmed to protect that hatch. In order to carry out that duty successfully, it's important they remain operational.
Well, the androids now know we have the ability to inflict serious on them, so if we attack that hatch, we create a dilemma.
The conflict between duty and survival should cause enough confusion in their logic circuits for them to start making mistakes, which is exactly what we want.
Well, let's find out.
Well done!
It's Adric.
You think so?
Lieutenant?
I think you should curtail the celebrations for the time being.
We must get this hatch open.
Whoever built this hatch now knows we've destroyed its guardians.
Ow! Your troopers got quite carried away, didn't they. I would suggest you get your people well back. The hatch may be booby-trapped.
Well, my arms are only this long. I can't get any further away.
No. You'd better get back, too.
Ah, got it. The release mechanism. You'd better get back too.
I'm not in the mood to argue.
Further than that!
Yes.
Oh.
A bomb. My opening the hatch has started up the arming procedure. You'd better let your people on the surface know what's happened.
I've no idea. Tegan, get everyone into the Tardis.
It was my own stupidity that started it off. The least I can do is to. Of course! Come on!
Set the coordinates at zero!
The arming procedure on the bomb is being operated by remote control.
Yes, but not till I know where it's coming from.
Well, that isn't right. Or is it?
Not long.
Come on, Adric, hurry!
If they increase power, they could break through.
Magnetic clamp.
Enough.
To make life intolerable for the few who survived.
Probe.
Well, there is somewhere. We just don't have enough of the pieces yet.
Laser cutter.
Why, you think they should have attacked earlier?
Oh, I don't think so. The androids are programmed to protect this hatch. Now, the cave system is enormous. Why draw attention to yourselves and your charge by attacking on the first day?
Magnetic drone.
There was power in that circuit!
The signal's breaking through.
I think drastic action is called for.
Abandon methodical procedure for blind instinct. Laser cutter!
Hmm. Right or wrong, here we go.
Tell me, Adric. Why a bomb?
Why a bomb and not a missile or some other device, and why these particular caves? There's a reason.
Oh, isn't it.
Right. The bomb is deactivated. Your own scientists can dismantle it. Good luck.
Well, thank you, thank you, but we must go. Still a great deal to do.
No, there isn't time.
Sector sixteen.
Er, no, just from where their signal originated.
Well, I'm hoping that won't be necessary.
All right.
Emotions. Love, pride, hate, fear. Have you no emotions then?
I imagine you have orders to destroy me.
You've no home planet, no influence, nothing. You're just a pathetic bunch of tin soldiers skulking about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship.
Er, Adric?
Do you have a moment?
Well, you can join the others later.
Look, I'm very grateful for your help with deactivating the bomb.
It was very brave of you also, the way you tackled the android.
Hmm. Look, I've been thinking about your wish to return home.
Well, I thought that if we could work out a satisfactory course, I might give it a try.
Really?
You've done extremely well.
Look, er, I'm sorry about our argument earlier.
Do you really want to go home?
So you've done all these calculations for nothing.
As near as I've been able to trace it.
And the crew entirely innocent of what's going on. So, we'll start with a recce.
You're sure?
Oh, I don't think it really matters.
There's no one about. The ship's totally automated.
A small one, somewhere.
I want to announce my presence, to see what the reaction is.
Someone should have seen us by now.
Minute or two more.
What's the matter?
We're being followed?
Over there!
They're finished.
I've seen wounds inflicted this way before.
Yes.
Then make sure you kill the right people. Look at them.
Look at the state they're in.
Look
Let me show you how we travelled here. We have a ship of our own. We don't need to be stowaways.
I assure you, you have the wrong people.
How can we? We've only just arrived on your ship.
Every word.
Oh, I wouldn't dare.
You said yourself things have occurred you can't explain.
Well, the crewmen who disappeared may have discovered otherwise.
How often has this happened?
Can't you isolate the power line?
Well, it's the only way you'll stop them.
I don't know, but I have the feeling whatever's causing your power loss is out for considerable more than control of this ship.
Your first officer is right. You must listen to her.
The story about the bomb is true. Whoever planted it is now in your hold.
You've got clearance through to Earth. That's where they want to go. You're giving them safe passage!
Why a bomb and not some other device.
Hmm. We still don't know what they're really after.
Perhaps I could help?
About time.
Definitely not.
Cybermen.
Far worse. You must withdraw your men, they don't stand a chance.
Oh, you haven't seen anything. Wait until the Cybermen start.
Oh yes, we go back a long way.
This slaughter is pointless.
It's the Cybermen's way.
I bet it isn't in gold.
Cybermen are rather allergic to the stuff. Brings them out in a cold sweat.
It clogs up their chest units. Suffocates them, doesn't it.
Originally Mondas, but that was destroyed. You know, I'm surprised they didn't mention me.
Oh, I doubt it. Especially as I confined them to a frozen tomb on Telos. Didn't they mention that either? Oh well, they have been forgetful.
Listen! The firing's stopped.
Look out!
Berger!
Those shields won't hold them there for long.
And then?
They're an invasion force. Earth is where they want to go. There are considerably more than a few on board.
Unfortunately, Cybermen don't need it. Is there any way you could jettison the hold?
Not at all.
Not yet. There may be a way to neutralise that.
They've started. I see from the computer the ship is powered by antimatter.
How is the antimatter contained?
Is there any way we could tap the stabilising device?
Excellent.
Yes.
We are under attack, Adric.
All right. First, tell me, what is the square root of three point six nine eight seven three?
Oh, he's very good. And almost right.
Antimatter powers the ship. For the antimatter to remain safe, it has to be contained in a vessel with a totally stable molecular structure otherwise it would, well, blow to bits.
Absolutely right. Although with computer-controlled electronics, it is possible to simulate it.
Right. However destructive the antimatter is, the vessel is always stable.
Oh, it is.
Well, if it doesn't, we're dead.
Right. Hurry.
Right.
Just a second.
I should have realised.
Er, no! Er
You never change. Always the perfect guests.
Fondness? I'm surprised your emotionless brain understands the word.
You've tried before.
I suspect the ship is now on a locked off fixed coordinate.
Yes.
Because I think they're turning us into a flying bomb.
I didn't know it was lost.
The reason for the red alert.
So you destroy a few presidents in a needlessly destructive way.
Of course. A war you couldn't possibly win.
Destroy the conference and you destroy the unity.
So the freighter replaces the bomb.
If the freighter crashes into Earth with you on board, won't that make it rather difficult for you to carry out your task? I mean, you would be very crumpled.
You don't surprise me.
Compared to some, this one is positively flippant.
Where did you come from?
An Earthling. No one of consequence.
Be quiet.
In a manner of speaking.
Of sorts.
Emotions have their uses.
They also enhance life! When did you last have the pleasure of smelling a flower, watching a sunset, eating a well-prepared meal?
For some people, small, beautiful events is what life is all about!
She's a friend.
I do not.
No!
No.
This isn't necessary. Let them go.
You've already proved your point quite adequately.
I want Adric, too.
I need him to help me fly the Tardis.
I'm not going without him.
Good luck, Adric.
Good luck to you all.
He's safe.
Yes.
It isn't necessary to taunt her.
Not at the moment.
Gently, Tegan.
No! You do things like that, we'll all finish up dead!
The freighter's jumped time warps.
Where?
I can't.
It's physically impossible. The freighter is no longer on a fixed course. The coordinates are constantly changing. That's why it keeps fading. I've got nothing to lock on to.
Although the freighter is spiraling backwards in time, it's still locked on to the same spatial coordinates.
Yes.
Earth.
It may be of some small consequence to know we've travelled backwards in time some sixty five million years.
Think about it.
The antimatter vessel will split open on impact. There will be a tremendous explosion.
It seems inevitable, as is your history as we know it.
Not at all. You've lost. The Earth is safe.
You've failed, Leader.
Get down!
The console's damaged.
I must save Adric!

Are you coming, or going? Or going or coming?
Yes. Well, let's get on with it. These must be the refractors.
Yes?
Sarah?
That sounds like Sarah.
It's not only oscillating, it's ellipsing as well. You'd better give her a hand, Harry.
Hmm, I see the problem. Focus gone a bit fuzzy.
Ah, Sarah. You're looking well. Look, er, it's going to take some time to do the whole lot. Why don't you two make the most of it?
Glorious day. Beautiful unspoilt countryside. No one's set foot here for thousands of years.
I'd phrase it more elegantly myself, of course. Yes.
Enjoy yourselves. Trafalgar Square should be that way.
If this is Piccadilly.
Mind the traffic.
Harry?
Is he a friend of yours?
No, I
Certainly. What would you like me to talk about?
I told you, I just got here.
I didn't use one. I came by transmat beam.
That's the truth. Who are you?
Ah.
Not creeping. I was repairing the
I'd not kill him. I heard a cry and found him with his neck broken in a gully. An accident, I imagine.
That's right.
Temporarily abandoned perhaps, but not junked. Oh, no.
I'm sorry to keep contradicting you, but there is a transmat beam from Space Station Nerva.
Space Station Nerva.
Nerva, transmat beam, Earth. It's as simple as that. Why don't you believe me?
Fascinating. You don't believe it exists, yet you've obviously heard of it.
Lost colony? Ah. You mean it's become a legend like lost Atlantis?
Lost Atlantis. It's a legendary city. A go, never mind. This is extremely interesting. Are you going to cut me loose?
Very colonial. You are from a colony, I take it?
Of course, on Nerva, they know that various colony ships left Earth. They'll be delighted to know that they're not the sole survivors of the human race. You are human?
Oh, no offence, no offence. Do you mind if I take a close look at that?
I' d say it's not a product of human technology, eh, Vural?
Ohm ten thousand years?
Well, no. I'm a sort of travelling time expert. As you can see, Earth's been habitable for several thousand years, but they didn't wake up. Why? Clock stopped. Overslept. So here I am.
Horologist, actually. And chronometrist. I just love clocks. Atomic clocks, wall quartz clocks, grandfather clocks
Cuckoo clocks.
Well, no, but then I didn't expect to meet anyone. I understood Earth wasn't inhabited.
A mayday? Then you're a military expedition, I take it.
Nine? Where are the rest?
Oh, rubbish. That's just the reception point for the transmat beam.
Thats wild talk, Erak. Far from killing me, you should treat me as an honoured guest.
Well, you don't want to be stuck here forever, do you.
I might consider helping you.
Simple. I finish refocusing the matter beam then we all pop up to Nerva, you get in touch with your headquarters and they send a ship for you.
Oh, absolutely.
Good girl, Sarah. Whos your fast friend?
I've lost my sonic screwdriver. I feel completely lost without it.
Shush. What would I do without you?
He couldn't have climbed out.
That machine you told me about, could that have lifted him?
Excuse me.
Terullian drive.
The machine. Now that's very interesting, because there's no terullian to be found in this galaxy.
Yes, don't you worry about it, old chap. He's half demented with shock.
Yes, well, I can't say I blame him for being wary of friend Vural, at any rate. You know, it's absolutely typical of Harry! How anyone in his proper mind could fall down a whacking great subsidence like. That's it!
Subsidence! A sewer or something. Maybe it's the Central Line.
I mean here must be some way out at the bottom. Hang on, Sarah. I'll just go down and take a look.
It's perfectly safe.
Oh. Ow. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah, are you there?
Hello? Sarah?
Oh, it's you again. Can't say I'm delighted. It's no use pretending.
If you insist.
Behind you!
No, it's not the Central Line.
Sarah! Listen to me, Sarah! It's not real. Do you understand? Nothing is happening to you. It's only in your mind.
Fight it, Sarah. Fight it.
Oh, Sarah.
You unspeakable abomination!
Why did you do it to her?
Well done, Harry.
Not me. Piece of the synestic locking mechanism from Nerva's rocket. Popped it in my pocket.
Foresight. You never know when these bits and pieces will come in handy.
Never throw anything away, Harry. Where's my five hundred year diary? I remember jotting some notes on the Sontarans. It's a mistake to clutter one's pockets, Harry.
What's Styre doing here?
Harry, Sontarans never do anything without a military reason. You look to Sarah.
Find out what's behind all this.
Hello. Hello. Don't be alarmed, old thing. Not going to hurt you. Everything's going to be all right.
Ah, Sarah, feeling better? No, don't tell me. No time. We've got an invasion on our hands.
Him, and thousands exactly like him.
The entire galaxy suddenly acquired some strategic importance in their endless war against the Rutans.
He's making an assessment of human physical limitations. Sontarans are very methodical people, and that might give us a slight advantage.
I'm going to take him on in single combat.
It's the only way.
Sontarans never turn down the chance to kill someone.
I hope not. I'm going to try and tire him out. He's pretty unwieldy, for all his strength, and he's not used to Earth's gravity. The thing is, if I can get him exhausted, he'll have to go back to his ship to reenergise. Are you with me?
While I keep him busy, I want you to get into his ship. Now, once you're inside, this is what I want you to do, Harry.
Styre!
Still about your butcher's ways, Styre?
Another mistake, Styre. You've fallen right into our trap.
Yes. Those people you've been so cleverly evaluating are not Earth warriors. They're our slave class, the lowest form of human intelligence.
Do you think those puny creatures could conquer half a galaxy? No, Styre, I represent the true warrior class. Evaluate me if you dare.
Ah. Is that the Sontaran way? The mighty warrior sheltering behind his gun? I challenge you, Styre. Single combat. Or are you afraid?
Styre, it's not over yet.
You're weakening, Styre. You're weakening.
It had better be. Let's get out of here.
I know. Everybody out, fast as you can. Come on!
Ask Harry, he did it.
It's a sort of terullian diode bypass transformer.
Yes. Sontarans, as I told you, sometimes need to feed on pure energy, and by removing that you altered things slightly, and the energy fed on him.
Yes. Well, I'll just attend to that.
Your Waterloo, Marshal. Your intelligence mission has been destroyed and your invasion plans are in our hands. One move across the buffer zone, Marshal, and your entire fleet will be destroyed.
What, without Styre's report?
Not today, thank you. (to Sarah and Harry) Brinkmanship, I think they call it.
Sure you won't join us?
As you wish. I should stand back if I were you.
I mean, it should be all right.
But you never know quite, do you?

Yes, I'm fine. The Tardis is feeling a bit queasy.
Yes. So would you be if you were warping about in E-space.
Yes, but not you personally.
There's a low probability we can slip off home through another CVE.
Please, don't keep saying that.
Not now, K9. Not now.
Well, it might be quite nice here.
Yes. We won't know until we've seen the sights, met a few more people.
Come on, E-space isn't that small. Something's bound to turn up.
Yes, I suppose I am, really. I've never given it much thought.
Not now, K9. What is it?
Well, why didn't you tell me? Is it inhabited?
Atmosphere?
Oh, knowing's easy. Everyone does that ad nauseam. I just sort of hope.
What do you make of it, K9?
Civilisation?
Well, at least there's life.
Yes, very nice.
Well, I put us down close to K9's energy concentration.
Ah. There! Look. Protective castle, village dwellings huddled like ducklings round their mother. Typical medieval scene.
Computers aren't infallible.
It's awfully nice out there, K9. Protective castle with village dwellings huddled like ducklings round their mother. Classic medieval scene. You'd better stay here. Come on, K9. Someone's got to stay on guard, and you can compute a reverse transition from existing data. You love doing that, eh?
Bye, bye, K9.
On the other hand, they may have opted deliberately for a semi-rural culture. It's a mistake to judge by appearances. Hello.
Hello. Maybe you can help us?
We were wondering if. Should have asked him the name of his tailor.
No.
Hello.
Well
No, no, no, please, just the Doctor will do. This is Romana.
How may you serve me? Well.
No, no. We were just wondering if there were any other scientists
Yes, scientists. You know, witch-wiggler, wangateur. Fortune teller? Mundunugu?
Yes.
I take it you don't get many strangers here.
Yes, visitors. Foreign devils. You know, people you don't know.
Who lives in this Tower of your?
Please, don't shout. Splendid, I'm sure. So you serve the Lords, but what do the Lords do for you?
Did you say the Wasting?
Oh, come on, Ivo. These Lords of yours, how long have they ruled over you?
Really. As long as that? Well, that's a long time.
These people are more complicated than you think, you know. Only to the next village.
Hmm.
Oh, just bats. They come out at night, you know. What do you mean, there isn't another village. Of course there's another village. There's got to be another village. Just a minute. Maybe you're right. K9's orbital scan. The settlement was the only thing to show up on it.
Hmm?
Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Romana. Er, we were just passing your charming planet and we thought we'd just, er, well, drop in. Look, I know this may seem a silly sort of question, but we were wondering if you could tell us something about E-space. E-space? Perhaps not.
Well, it's quite a technocotheca you've got here.
I don't know. I think it's some sort of museum.
Well, I've dabbled a bit.
What, do you mean who are we, where do we come from that sort of thing?
Come on, let's not talk about us. This looks much more interesting.
I see you've got some of it working.
What? Isn't that a bit dangerous? I mean, a chap in the village told me the Lords protected you from the Wasting.
Well, only by hearsay. What is the Wasting?
Yes.
Ah.
How long ago was that?
What? Reading forbidden?
Just a minute. Got it. Ha, ha!
Now we'll find out something. I
Oh, must have been out of guarantee. Instruction manual would be helpful.
Ah, lovely old technology. Back on twentieth century Earth, the engineers used to just
Definitely an Earth device.
Instead of which they finish up here.
Yes, not bad after a thousand years in memory.
Yes, long since dead.
What?
Who did you see every day?
That's two.
Well, I think it's time we got to know them, don't you, Romana?
Thank you.
Night must fall, Romana, even in E-space.
Never mind. It's bats. Quite harmless.
Ow! Well, in theory. That one was a bit carnivorous.
Come on!
Funny about the windows.
Yes, and then there's the general architectural style. Would you call it rococo?
Just testing a theory.
Yes?
Greetings. How do you do? I'm the Doctor.
Gosh.
Oh, er, well, we were just admiring your tower. Weren't we admiring the tower?
Well, you certainly do very well for yourselves here.
No, no, indeed. Still, you do better than the peasants. Bull's blood, I think.
Quite right. Probably give them indigestion. There's nothing worse than a peasant with indigestion. Makes them quite rebellious. I hear you've been having trouble that way.
Ah well, toodle-oo.
Sorry. Are you all right?
Yes, we were blown off-course.
We were hoping you'd tell us how you got here, or better still, how to get back.
Such a pity.
Surely you realise something here must be wrong?
Yes.
No. What is, is wrong. Look, societies develop in varying ways. Yours just seems to be sinking back into some sort of primitivism. Wouldn't you say so?
On level two?
An even more powerful force?
Well, mysterious or not, those rebels seem to think the power emanates from you.
A division? Yawning chasm, I'd say. Wouldn't you?
Oh, I wish I'd thought of that. That's a good diagnosis. Yes, I've never seen such a state of decay.
Ah.
What did you say?
Ship of state?
Ah. It's just odd, you see, that he should mention that, because Romana and I have just been at your ship's old manifest and I can't remember what the ship was called but Romana might be able to remember. What was it called, Romana?
Yes, Hydrax. Does that mean anything to you? Hydrax? Hydrax?
No, please don't be silent. It's so fascinating.
You know something? I don't think they want to be followed. Let's sit down.
Oh yes, this is much more comfortable. What were those Hydrax officers called?
That's very good. Have you ever heard of the Brothers Grimm?
They also discovered the Law of Consonantal Shift. How language changes over the years.
Hmm.
That's right. And MacMillan becomes?
And O'Connor becomes?
Yes. And this is the original ship. The pilot here, co-pilot there. No, no, no, pilot there, co-pilot here. Instrument banks there, control panels there.
Yes. Do you fancy exploring it?
Inspection hatch.
Shush. Inspection hatch.
Hmm?
Romana, I've found the inspection hatch.
Yes. It's an Arrow class scout ship, Romana. It detaches from the main vessel for local exploration.
Well, why bother? No one comes here. Look! There's even a bit of power left in the energy cells.
Possibly.
Getting out is not exactly the object of our mission, is it?
Shush.
Shush.
More evidence.
I have a suspicion, but it's too horrible to think about.
Right in the bowels of the ship. Disused fuel tanks, I think.
Yes.
A way out.
I doubt very much if the creature lives in the Tower, but since the Tower feeds it I imagine it lives close by.
We'll know that when we find it.
They've been completely drained. Pipe leading.
I was wrong, Romana. The fuel tanks aren't disused. Only this isn't rocket fuel, it's blood.
You all right?
Good, good. We'll soon be there.
Come on. Ah!
You jumped on my toe.
Shush.
It's that sound again.
No. The sound of a giant heartbeat.
Yes?
Do you know what that is?
Exactly. Come on.
Do you know, it just occurs to me. There are vampire legends on almost every inhabited planet.
Yes. Creatures that stalk in the night and feast on the blood of the living. Creatures that fear sunlight and running water and certain herbs. Creatures that are so strong they can only be killed by beheading, or a stake through the heart.
Whatever it is, we want to find it, don't we?
Good. Come on then.
Where?
Ah.
Well, I'm glad to catch someone at home. Are we in time for a guided tour?
No.
Me?
What purpose?
I could? Well, you know, I've never been a great one for swarming. It's awfully kind of you to offer, but where were you thinking of swarming to?
Ah ha! So there was a guided tour.
Was that when you were just plain Science Officer O'Connor?
Yes. Those officers aren't the descendants of the originals, they are the originals.
(sotto) Yes. No. Too dangerous.
Who's he talking about?
Adric?
No. There is a third choice.
I can destroy the Great One. Off you go, Romana!
I will not serve. I will not serve.
Cover your eyes, Romana. That might be all right for half-starved peasantry, Aukon, but it doesn't scare Time Lords.
There was once an old hermit from the mountains of south Gallifrey.
Yes. Yes, he did. He used to tell me ghost stories. I like a ghost story. Do you want to hear one?
It's about a race of giant vampires.
Mmm. They came out of nowhere, and swarmed and swarmed
Swarmed. That was the word he used.
They swarmed all over the universe. And they were so strong that one single vampire could suck the life out of an entire planet.
Yes.
Well, he wasn't a scientist. There are other ways of looking at life, you know. Anyway, according to the story, we Time Lords hunted them down across the universe in a war so long and so bloody that we were sickened of violence forever.
One of them escaped, I think.
Just vanished into thin air. Poof.
Hmm? When was all what supposed to have happened?
Oh, that. Oh, in the misty dawn of history, when even Rassilon was young.
So?
And? Shush.
What time vehicles?
What time vehicles?
Psst. The Tardis is a Type Forty.
Yes. Psst. You are wonderful.
Yes, I'm fine.
Tarak, now listen. We're going back to our ship for some information. I want you to tell Kalmar. No, wait. Tell Kalmar to prepare an attack, but not to move until I join you, all right?
Good. Come on, let's go.
Adric? Adric? Where can we start?
If that thing down there's what I think it is, and if it escaped into our universe, billions of lives would be lost. Could you take me there?
Come on. No, no. Romana, you take the Tardis and I'll take the inner sanctum.
Good.
Yes, I know, I know. What do you mean, letting stowaways aboard the Tardis? It isn't a number nine bus, you know.
Yes, well, never mind about that. We've got work to do.
I want you to help me tap the memory core of the Tardis. Now, the information I want will be on the earliest section of the data core. It's called the Record of Rassilon and it's to do with (strokes his throat where the bat bit him)
Vampires.
Well?
Well?
Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?
Have you tried Rassilon, Record of?
Vampires.
Okay, try your folklore section.
No, thank you. Not Dracula. Emergency instructions.
No, no, no, thank you. No, thank you.
Well, why didn't you say? Of course!
The Record of Rassilon.
Oh, good. The Record of Rassilon.
Got it! Vampire army. Phew, listen to this, K9. So powerful were the bodies of these great creatures, and so fiercely did they cling to life, that they were impossible to kill, save by the use of bow ships. Bow ships? What are bow ships?
Never mind. Yet slain they all were, and to the last one, by the Lords of Time. The Lords of Time destroying them utterly. Well, that's good news. However, when the bodies were counted (gasp) I knew it. Just like the legend said. When the bodies were counted, the King Vampire, mightiest and most malevolent of all, had vanished, even to his shadow, from time and space. Until now.
Hence it is the directive of Rassilon that any Time Lord who comes upon this enemy of our people and of all living things, shall use all his efforts to destroy him, even at the cost of his own life.
What? That's a good question. Let's see what it says about battle.
Cattle, rattle, battle.
Got it. Energy weapons were useless because the monsters absorbed and transmuted the energy using it to become stronger. Therefore Rassilon ordered the construction of bow ships. Ah. Swift vessels that fired a mighty bold of steel that transfixed the monsters through the heart. For only if his heart be utterly destroyed will a vampire die.
What? What is it?
Well, it might come in useful, if we can only lay our hands on a mighty bolt of steel.
It's no good, K9.
Listen. I'm going to have to go to the rebels for help. But will they help, I ask myself.
Shush. I'm thinking. I've got to make a very impressive entrance. Something that'll win them over entirely. Got it! Right, K9, we need a slight spatial movement and no temporary displacement. Very tricky, these short hops.
What is it?
But of course. Good boy, K9.
Halt! Don't move. Look, I'm awfully sorry to drop in on you like this, but we do have a bit of a crisis on our hands.
Lack of weapons. No experience. Odds almost insurmountable. But! He who outlives this day and comes safe home shall stand a-tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of E-space!
Well, that's the problem. There's got to be an answer.
That's the question.
Yes, yes.
You've got to be ready. You people have had a thousand years to rid yourselves of this evil and now all you've got are three hours.
Where do you think Zargo and his friends got their powers?
No, and that's the very devil of it. If I had any instruments with me, I could show you.
Scanner. Scanner?
Range?
Right, Now, Kalmar, you'll see I'm telling you the truth. Gather round, gentlemen. Hang on a minute, hang on a minute. It'll take a moment or two for the picture to steady. There we are. Oh, it seems to scan right through the spectrum.
Yes. The spectrum's a bit weak at the moment. Infra-red. Picking up sleeping life forms. Now we're going into x-ray. Watch the area below the Tower.
Oh.
The heartbeat of the Great Vampire. Well, Kalmar?
Our HQ, the Tower. Now, we can take the Tower between us.
Yes, well, I'm pretty sure of that.
Aukon and his friends will be distracted by the ceremony.
Well, there are ways of dealing with guards.
Yes, but that was after a long and bloody war, and they had bow ships that fire mighty bolts of steel and pierced each vampire's heart.
Their cardiovascular system's incredibly efficient. They can just seal over minor wounds. Yes, there's a very practical reason for the traditional wooden stake.
No, I doubt if even that would be big enough, and anyway, how could we propel it? Mighty bolt of steel.
Of course. Of course! An arrow of steel, and I've been looking at it all this time. Right, gentlemen, let's gather round and finalise our plans. Now, we need a group of your best men, a sort of commando force.
No.
It's all right, it's all right. I've got other things to worry about. But, I can lend you a very useful tool. Armoured. Immune to hypnotism.
And a dead shot with a nose laser.
K9.
Good, good.
The others have gone, therefore the ceremony must have started. Now listen to me, all of you. I want you to hold this Tower until K9 gives the signal.
One day you'll apologise for that.
Shush. Never mind. Just trust me, it'll work. After K9's signal, you evacuate the Tower and make your way round to the caves. If you should find Romana and Adric, see if you can rescue them and get away from here as far and as fast as you can. Got it? Good. Go. Stop. Don't forget, K9 gives the signal.
Three scoutships, three chances. Now, which one first? This one.
Come on. Dead as a dinosaur. The circuits must be corroded. Have to try one of the others.
Come on.
One to go.
Come on. Come on! What happened to all that Earth craftsmanship, eh? Just because you've been laid up for a thousand years.
A scintilla of power left in the energy cells, a few drops of fuel. Oh, lovely Earth craftsmanship.
That should do it. Short trip, quick flip. Time to be going, Doctor.
Romana! Right, time for me to tell you what happened.
Right. Yes.
Don't worry, don't worry. Have you ever heard the expression what goes up must come down?
I wish I hadn't.
Get down! Get down!
There was never really anything to worry about. Their time was up. Well done. Well done, well done, well done.
Well, I just fired off one of the rocket ships, you see, and I arranged the controls so that it went straight up
Ah. Well, they just went to pieces.
Yes.
It was nothing.
Yes?
Go on, then.
There, that should do it.
There, that should do it. Well, Kalmar, there's all the knowledge you'll need in there. Use it well, and if that's what you want, you can be a high technological society in no time.
Good, good.
Yes?
Yes? Inside, you two. We just have to get on with this.
Well, I really don't know. You see, we came here by accident, but you were brought here by the Great Vampire's brain and his secret died with him. Kalmar, such good luck.
And you, young man, you're going straight home.
You're going straight back to the Starliner.

Nice, isn't it?
Marvellous. Absolutely.
Well, I think it's marvellous.
Really? How did I describe it?
It's the only place in the world where one can relax entirely.
What Paris has, it has an ethos, a life. It has
A spirit all of its own. Like a wine, It has
It has a bouquet. Yes. Like a good wine. You have to choose one of the vintage years, of course.
Ah well, yes. It's 1979 actually. More of a table wine, shall we say. Ha! The randomiser's a useful device but it lacks true discrimination. Should we sip it and see?
Let's not be ostentatious.
That would look silly. We'll take the lift. Come on.
Are you talking philosophically or geographically?
Then we're going to lunch. I know a little place that does a wonderful bouillabaisse. Do you like bouillabaisse?
Hmm.
Not bad. A bit boring in the middle. Don't move. You might spoil a priceless work of art.
That man over there. Don't look!
Shush.
He's sketching you.
I told you not to look.
Well, it's too late. He's gone now.
Well, he threw it down there. Let's have a look.
Shush!
He's sketching you.
I told you not to look.
Well, it's too late. He's gone now.
Well, he threw it down there. Let's have a look.
I don't know. It's as if time jumped a groove for a second.
For a portrait of a Time Lady, that's not at all a bad likeness.
Yes, isn't it.
Ha. Almost like a crack in time. A crack in time.
I think there's a matter with time. Didn't you feel anything?
Yes. It must be because I've crossed the time fields so often. No one there seemed to notice anything. You and I exist in a special relationship to time, you know. Perpetual outsiders.
Hmm? What do you make of that, then?
What? Computer pictures? You sit in Paris and talk of computer pictures? Listen, I'll take you somewhere and show you some real paintings painted by real people.
Never mind about the time slip. We're on holiday. Come on!
There we are, the Louvre. One of the greatest art galleries in the whole galaxy.
What? Oh no. No, no.
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is the gallery. The only gallery in the known universe which a picture like
The Mona Lisa.
Quite good? That's one of the great treasures of the universe and you say quite good?
What are you talking about?
I don't care. It's one of the great treasures of the universe!
I don't care. Let them gawp, let them gape. What do I care.
What? Is that all you can say? No eyebrows? We're talking about the Mona Lisa. It's the Mona
Good heavens, you're right. She hasn't got any eyebrows. Do you know, I never noticed that before.
Yes? What is it?
What?
She said
Excuse me.
Yes. I just dented my head on your gun, that's all.
One of my funny turns? The whole world took a funny turn.
Merci.
Yes, all the way from the Louvre by that idiot with the gun.
Well, of course I noticed.
Look in your pocket. Other pocket.
The woman I bumped into was wearing it.
Look at it.
That's right. She was using it to get a complete report on all the alarm systems around the Mona Lisa.
It is very a pretty painting.
That? That's never the product of Earth's civilisation.
It is a very pretty painting. Romana?
You know, I think something very funny is going on. You remember that man who was following us?
Well, he's standing behind me poking a gun in my back.
Patron, three glasses of water. Make them doubles.
What bracelet?
Yes, I'm just relaxing and enjoying Paris.
What are you talking about?
My men? Those thugs?
Are you suggesting those men were in my employ?
I don't know if you noticed but he was pointing a gun at me. Anyone in my employ who behaved like that, I'd sack him on the spot.
You're English, aren't you?
Patron? I thought I ordered three glasses of water.
Doctor.
Scarlioni's angle? Never heard of it. Have you ever heard of Scarlioni's angle?
Who's Scarlioni?
What?
Ah, well, we've only just landed on Earth.
Crazy enough to want to steal the Mona Lisa?
Or at least be interested in someone who might want to steal the Mona Lisa.
All fakes, of course.
Really? What, and the only connection in this is the Count?
So?
He isn't clean any more. The Countess has the bracelet.
Well, it depends on what you want to do with it. Uh oh.
I think we're being invited to leave.
I say, what a wonderful butler. He's so violent. Hello, I'm called the Doctor. That's Romana, that's Duggan. You must be the Countess Scarlioni and this is clearly a delightful Louis Quinze chair. May I sit in it? I say, haven't they worn well? Thank you, Hermann, that'll be all.
Well, I'm a very pleasant fellow.
Yes, I could see that the moment you didn't invite me to have a drink. Well, I will have a drink now you come to mention it. Yes, do come in, everybody.
Romana, sit down over there. Duggan. Now, Duggan, you sit there. Do sit down if you want to, Count. Oh, all right. Now, isn't this nice?
Ah, well, it's my job, you see. I'm a thief. And this is Romana, she's my accomplice. And this is Duggan. He's the detective who's been kind enough to catch me. That's his job. You see, our two lines of work dovetail beautifully.
Yes.
Ah. Well, you're a beautiful woman, probably, and Duggan was trying to summon up the courage to ask you out to dinner, weren't you, Duggan?
Who sent me what?
What?
Hello there.
Well, I just thought it was awfully pretty and a terribly unusual design. Of course, it would have been much nicer to have stolen one of the pictures, but I've tried that before and all sorts of alarms go off which disturbs the concentration.
Yes. Well, I think it is. Don't you?
Oh.
Good. Well, we'll be off. A quick stagger up the Champs Elysees, perhaps a bite at Maxims. What do you think, Romana?
Ah. Duggan, what are you doing? For heavens sake, that's a Louis Quinze.
Just behave like a civilised guest. I do beg your pardon, Count.
Now, Hermann, if you'd just be kind enough to show us to our cellar, we'd be terribly grateful. Do come along, my good chap.
How long's the Chateau been here, Hermann?
Really, that long? Restored four or five hundred years ago?
Very stimulating, very stimulating. And this would be the cellar, would it?
Really. Good Lord, a laboratory. Are you locking us into a laboratory?
Oh, I'd much rather stay out here. This looks so interesting.
What happens after that?
Shush. Light the lamp.
Then get it right.
Exactly, exactly. What's the point of coming all the way here just to escape immediately? What we do is, we stay here.
Let them think they've got us safe.
Then we escape. Light the lamp. Come on.
It's not working.
Don't!
It was useful against the Daleks on Skaro.
Oh, you wouldn't remember. Never mind.
It's working. Would you like to stay on as my scientific advisor?
Yes?
Yes, I suppose so. Why?
That's fascinating. Shall we look at the lab first?
No. There are bound to be a couple of guards at the top of the stairs.
I want to look at the lab first.
In the last few hours I've been thumped, threatened, abducted and imprisoned. I've found a piece of equipment which is not of Earth technology and I've been through two time slips. I think this lab might have something to do with it.
What about it?
Yes.
They're not going to steal it at five o'clock in the afternoon, are they?
Because the Louvre is still open.
Now, while we're here, why don't you and I find out how they're going to steal it and why. Or are you just in it for the thumping?
I know, but mainly for the thumping. What do you think Romana's up to?
Nor do I. Looks intriguing, don't you think?
What?
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Me?
Me? I'm the Doctor. What you're doing is terribly interesting, but you've got it wrong.
Well, you're tinkering with time. That's always a bad idea unless you know what you're doing.
The whole world?
Well, that's a very small place when you consider the size of the universe.
Oh, some can. And if you can't, you shouldn't tinker with time.
It'll be the end of you, if you're not careful, never mind the cow. Look.
A few technical problems! No, no, no. The whole principle you're working on is wrong. You can stretch time backwards or forwards within that bubble, but you can't break into it or out of it. It's true you have created a different time continuum, but it's totally incompatible with ours.
Have you tried this?
That's a more interesting effect, don't you think? Did you know when you built that it could do something like that?
What do you mean, what did I do? I just reversed the polarity. This is very expensive equipment, isn't it?
Well, you'd. What's your name?
Kerensky?
Theodore Nikolai Kerensky, a scientist's job is to ask questions. You should
Theodore. Theo. Kerensky! He's fainted.
Yes, that's your philosophy, isn't it. If it moves, hit it. He's going to be all right. If you do that one more time, Duggan, I'm going to take very, very severe measures.
I'm going to ask you not to.
Yes?
About what?
Let's look.
Very impressive.
Yes, four to five hundred years.
No, no, no. In my view, a room that's been bricked up for four or five hundred years is urgently overdue for an airing.
Duggan.
He seems to be financing some dangerous experiment with time. The professor, of course, thinks he's breeding chickens.
I think I'm going to need some machinery.
Eh?
I don't know.
It's the Mona Lisa.
I don't know what's hanging in the Louvre, but this is the genuine article.
The brushwork's Leonardo's.
It's as characteristic as a signature. The pigment, too.
Every one. What I don't understand is why a man who's got six Mona Lisas wants to go to all the trouble of stealing a seventh.
I wouldn't make a very good criminal, would I?
Can I ask you where you got these?
Right. Or how you knew they were here?
They've been bricked up a long time.
I like concise answers.
Oh?
Oh.
No.
Duggan! Duggan, why is it that every time I start to talk to someone, you knock him unconscious?
Well, if you don't understand heads, you shouldn't go about hitting them.
Duggan! Your job is to stop his men from stealing the Mona Lisa. The other Mona Lisa.
I should think so, too. That was a Ming vase, second dynasty. Absolutely priceless.
No, you have. Romana, you look after him. I've got to go meet an Italian. Middle-aged Italian. In fact, late middle-aged. Renaissance. Come on.
Hello, K9. You all right?
Leonardo? Leonardo? Ah, that Renaissance sunshine. Leonardo? The paintings went down very well. Everybody loved them. Last Supper, Mona Lisa. You remember the Mona Lisa? That dreadful woman with no eyebrows who wouldn't sit still, eh? Your idea for the helicopter took a bit longer to catch on, but as I say, these things take time.
Me?
Ah, well, I just dropped by to see Leonardo, actually. Is he about?
Really?
Captain Tancredi?
No.
Well, I'll want to question him, so we can both have a little chat, can't we.
You. What are you doing here?
Well, I do flit about a bit, you know.
Yes, I suppose so.
I don't know. I don't seem to be able to help myself. There I am, just walking along minding my own business and pop! I'm on a different planet or even a different time. But enough of my problems. What are you doing here?
Well, I mean, if you're the last of them, there can't be that many about to save, can there? Jagaroth?
Jagaroth. I think it was on one of my trips. Yes, you all destroyed yourself in some massive war. Wait, when.
Is it really? How time passes. So what are you doing here?
Yes, well, four hundred million years ago it would have been a bit of a shambles. No life to tidy it up. No life.
Well, as I was saying
What box?
That box? I don't know. I've never seen that box in my life. Ah!
The original, I presume? Completed in 1503 and it's now what, 1505, and you're getting the old boy to do you another six, yes, which you then brick up in a cellar in Paris for Scarlioni to find in four hundred and seventy four time. That's a very nice piece of capital investment.
Oh, thank you.
How can I talk if you confiscate my
Yes.
He's mad, isn't he? Must be a tough job humouring him. You don't believe all that, do you?
Well, Jagaroth spaceships. Isn't it. Isn't it?
Yes, well, I mean, quite honestly, when you think about all that Jagaroth spaceship.
The Borgias? Yes, yes, I see your point.
Yes. As I said, I see your point.
No, no, it's all right, all right. Come on now. Smile. You can do it. There you are.
There we are. Here we are, look.
Isn't that nice? Isn't that nice?
Dear Leo. Sorry to have missed you. Hope you're well. Sorry about the mess on the panels. Just paint over, there's a good chap. See you earlier. Love, the Doctor.
I know, it's just his hands are cold.
All this is totally unnecessary.
I've changed my mind. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's being tortured by someone with cold hands. What is it you want to know?
It's simple. I'm a Time Lord.
Well.
What do you mean, time's running out. It's only 1505.
All right, all right. I'll tell you. There is one thing I'd like to know is how do you communicate across time with the other splinters of yourself?
Are you all right?
Right-o.
Is he often like this?
The centuries that divide me shall be undone. I don't like the sound of that.
Well, what news?
What?
Excuse me. Ah, it's you. Did you notice two people trying to stop that painting from being stolen last night?
Two people. One was a pretty girl and a young man, fair hair. He was always hitting. Shush. Were they here?
Shush. No time. I've got the human race to think about. Shush. The human race.
Patron, you remember those two people I was in here with yesterday? We kept being held up and attacked. Smashing things. You don't happen to know where they went, do you? No. They can't have been mad enough to go back to the chateau.
Thank you. (reads) Dear Doctor, gone back to the chateau. Thank you.
I'd like to make an appointment with Count Scarlioni at his earliest convenience, if you don't mind, that is.
Ah, someone in authority. I wonder, would you be kind and tell the Count that I wait upon him, please? There's a good girl.
The silent type, eh? I once knew a boy like you. Never said a word, very taciturn. Well, I said to him, there's no point in talking if you've got nothing to say. Did well in the end, though. Name of Shakespeare. Ever read any Shakespeare? Countess?
What? It's been missing for centuries.
I know. I recognise the handwriting.
No, mine. He'd sprained his wrist writing sonnets. Wonderful stuff. To be or not to be, that's the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and. Take arms against a sea of troubles? That's a mixed. I told him that was a mixed metaphor and he would insist.
Only Nor-norwest. Nobody's perfect. If you think I'm mad because I say I met Shakespeare, where do you think your precious Count got that?
Contacts? Human contacts? How much do you really know about him, eh? I think rather less than you imagine.
How long have you been married to the Count?
Long enough. I like that. Discretion and charm. So civilised. So terribly unhelpful.
There is such a thing as discretion. There's also such a thing as wilful blindness.
Yes! You see the Count as a master criminal, an art dealer, an insanely wealthy man, and you'd like to see yourself as his consort. But what's he doing in the cellar?
Man? Are you sure of that? A man with one eye and green skin, eh? Ransacking the art treasures of history to help him make a machine to reunite him with his people, the Jagaroth, and you didn't notice anything? How discreet, how charming.
Think about it, Countess. Think about it.
Ah, Count. Hello. I wonder if you could spare me a moment of your time. Romana, hello, how are you? I see the Count's roped you in as a lab assistant. What are you making for him? A model railway? Gallifreyan egg timer? I hope you're not making a time machine. I shall be very angry.
Indeed, indeed, yes. I so much prefer the weather in the early part of the sixteenth century, don't you? Where's Duggan?
Ah, there you are, Duggan. Are you behaving yourself? Good, good. Now, Count, this is what I've come to say. If you're thinking of going back in time, you'd better forget it.
Well, because I'm going to stop you.
I am?
Count, that sort of blackmail won't work because I know what the consequences will be if you get what you wanted. I can't let you fool about with time.
Ah, well, I'm a professional. I know what I'm doing. I also know what you're doing. Romana, put the equipment down.
Count, do you realise what will happen if you try to go back to the time before history began?
Shush.
They're not nice to know.
Yes, without the stabiliser he only had the time bubble.
What he was really trying to do was to put the whole world in the bubble, like those tiny jumps in time when we first arrived.
Cracks in time. He shifted the whole world back in time for two seconds, but what he really wanted to do was shift the whole world back in time four hundred million years.
What do you think we've been chasing about for all this time?
Yes. He couldn't have sold them anyway.
Well, before Leonardo painted them, I wrote These are Fakes on the blank board with felt tip. It would show up under any x-ray.
No, because you supplied him with the vital component he needed.
One minute would be sufficient for him to go back in time, contact his ship and prevent it exploding. He wouldn't then be splintered in time and all history would be changed.
I've got an idea.
We'll ask Duggan.
Very pretty.
How very fulfilling for you.
What? We're going on a journey.
Just don't ask. Come on.
The Jagaroth will leave a faint trace through time, but we can only follow it if we get to the Tardis in minutes. Come on.
Is no one interested in history?
This will be the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Duggan, we are where I promised we'd be. Four hundred million years back in Earth history.
Yes.
He'll be here. Ah. There's the Jagaroth ship. The last of the Jagaroth, a vicious, callous, war-like race. The universe won't miss them.
Yes.
The amniotic fluid from which all life on Earth will spring, where the amino acids fuse to form minute cells. Cells which eventually evolve into vegetable and animal life. You, Duggan.
Yes. Well, not that soup exactly. It's inert. There's no life in it yet. It's waiting on a massive dose of radiation.
Yes. The explosion that caused Scarlioni to splinter in time also caused the birth of the human race, and that's what's about to happen. The birth of life itself.
No, no, if we were watching we'd be in dead trouble. We've got to stop Scaroth.
Yes, that's his real name. If we don't stop him, the entire human race will cease to exist instantly.
Hmm?
Scaroth. We've got to stop him.
No, Scaroth, you can't.
No, Scaroth, no. You've pressed it once. You've thrown the dice once. You don't get a second throw.
No! The explosion that you in there are about to trigger off will give birth to the human race. The moment your race kills itself, another is born. That has happened. It will happen.
No, the product of your destruction. History cannot change. It cannot!
Duggan. Duggan. I think that was possibly the most important punch in history.
His time's up. He's gone back to the chateau.
It's about to explode, you mean. Come on!
Mmm. It was the only one that wasn't damaged in the fire.
Doesn't it? Well, some people would say that's the whole point of painting.
Serves them right. If they have to x-ray it to find out whether it's good or not, they might as well have painting by computer.
Mmm.
Mmm.
From? Well, I suppose the best way to find out where you've come from is to find out where you're going and then work backwards.
I don't know.
Goodbye.
Bye, bye, Duggan!

How many times have I told you, Adric, not to interfere with, with things that you don't understand.
In the TSS? You were lucky you didn't destroy the whole Kinda tribe.
That isn't the point. You should never have got into that unit.
Apart from Aris.
Try to understand, Adric, because you get away with something, it doesn't justify it.
Next time you want to escape from somewhere, walk.
Is Tegan ready?
A fault.
Must be the lateral balance cones again. You know, I must do some maintenance after we've delivered Tegan.
Now, don't jump to conclusions, Adric. Sometimes we humanoids try to disguise our, our true feelings. Well, don't just stand there, Adric, help me.
Earth, Heathrow, 1981.
Not one of the most stimulating places in the universe, but nevertheless, where requested to be.
Oh, no.
Hmm, yes, a small error has been made.
It's probably due to nothing more than a temperamental solenoid on the lateral balance cones.
And, as you know, the Tardis isn't always
Er, reliable.
Why does she always overreact?
Then why didn't she say so, rather than fly off the handle like that.
No, no, no. Too much has been said already. Earthlings.
I'm sorry. I realise how disappointed you must be.
And I'll keep it. Consider this a fortuitous mistake. It isn't everyone who gets the chance to wander round their own history.
What? I suppose it does a bit.
Sulphur.
Wrong time and place for that.
Undoubtedly. When we find the person who's burning the sulphur, perhaps you'll believe him.
Probably not.
There's potassium nitrate in with the sulphur.
Potassium nitrate and sulphur are constituents of a primitive explosive. Gunpowder.
This time I agree.
Ah! Good morning.
Come on, back to the Tardis.
Come on, come on. This way.
There's nothing broken. Can you stand?
Can you help us?
Lead on, sir.
Why were those men following us?
Well, we're new to the area.
Of course. The reason for the sulphuric smoke. Purification fires.
Hence the guns.
How bad is the plague?
Why?
They're not due for a comet for years.
Interesting, and so is the ornament around your neck.
Yes. Not yet. May I see?
Hmm. Interesting piece of work. What do you think?
Yes.
Do you mind if I have a look around your loft?
Fit for a climb, Adric?
Oh, have a look round down there.
Part of an alien bracelet made for a very special purpose.
Oh, make your own guess. A comet when there shouldn't have been a comet, a meteor that doesn't look like a meteor. Whatever the phenomenon was, it certainly wasn't natural.
Or burning up in the atmosphere.
Ah, not necessarily. The bracelet is strong enough to have survived the crash. However, if we find something more fragile.
Correct.
Well done!
Tell me, who owns this barn?
Of course. I've met kings, emperors, megalomaniacs in my time.
I'm calling on the master of the house, not his servants.
You knock while I look around.
Just Nyssa. If anyone opens the door, call me.
No one at home.
Perhaps we should find out. That window doesn't look fastened properly.
What a very pleasant room.
No, not yet. Let's see who's at home first. Hello?
Well, I'm not. For all I know they went to the village.
Indeed. So, the sooner we find out, the sooner we can return Tegan to her own time. Anyone at home?
No, not really. Polygrite is found in many parts of the universe. So are power packs.
Well, if I'm right, the comet that actor saw was their ship burning up in the atmosphere. They're probably stranded here, desperate. They could wreak havoc.
Oh, twist their arms a bit to let me take them back to their own planet.
I'll find something.
There are weapons missing.
Gunpowder. Someone's been careless.
So they have been here.
You're beginning to sound like Tegan.
Oh.
Look.
And fired from a weapon.
Hold this.
There.
Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, assume it was an accident.
But this isn't.
Well, you only build a staircase to lead somewhere.
Why should anyone want to build a wall here?
Well, this should be a very important staircase. Logically it should lead from the main hall to the kitchens.
No. There's something wrong. I can feel it.
Ah.
Yes?
It is, isn't it.
Very simple. I found the door.
It's there all the same. I knew there was something peculiar about this wall.
Right! I picked the lock.
Camouflage. As you pass through it, it opens around you.
I must speak to the people who invented it.
Not yet.
Soliton gas.
Well, someone who needs it to breathe properly. Let's find them.
I said, let's find them.
So
This must be it.
They're near.
You said you wanted wine. Help yourself.
Just don't disturb anything.
The regulator isn't pulsing properly.
Oh. Well, perhaps they're just for research.
No, don't!
Nyssa, get out of here.
Just get out of here.
Now, I don't know if you can understand me, but I would like to point out how volatile soliton is when mixed freely with oxygen.
You fire that beam of yours, you'll turn this house into an inferno.
Adric, can you move?
Tegan!
Adric, look after her. I'll be back.
That's what you're supposed to think.
An android. A mechanical man. A machine.
Oh, it takes more than a pair of flintlocks to damage an android.
No, but I don't know how badly hurt she is. Where are you going?
I came up here to get you.
Adric and Tegan are hurt. I need your help to get them out.
You see this? This a part of a control bracelet. It's a device used on prison planets to control difficult prisoners. It isn't an ornament. And the thing you saw in the cellar comes from the same place as the bracelet.
Like this.
If this was on your wrist, you'd have lost control of your mind by now.
Well.
This is a trick you won't see done for many a day.
That's what happens when you discharge a power pack.
Why are Earth people so parochial?
Come on, Nyssa, let's go.
Well, there's nothing we can do now until we've dealt with the android.
No. Well, er, we'll try modifying the sonic booster in the Tardis. If we connect it to a frequency accelerator
Well, we may just get a high enough pitch to vibrate the android to pieces.
Very.
I have no intention of doing so. Now, if you've quite finished lecturing me, I suggest we go back to the Tardis and get started.
That way's locked. Good day!
We're wasting time, Nyssa.
If you see anyone wearing a bracelet like this, stay away from them.
Come on.
No one here.
Most of the hardware is up at the house, I should think.
An escape pod. A sort of life boat, only from a ship that flies.
That's right.
Because it buried itself on impact.
Vintaric crystals. Quite a common form of lighting.
The lights you saw in the sky a few weeks ago, were the main part of the ship burning up in the atmosphere.
The presence of the pod confirms it.
Ah. That would be rather difficult to explain.
Which is more than you can say for the owners of this ship.
I wonder how many Terileptils this pod could carry?
Yes. Terileptils build those things too well.
It has to. The androids are programmed to protect. The only way around them is to destroy them before they destroy you.
Well, it obviously wanted prisoners. We can't rely on it remaining so benign.
Yes. A refresher course in android design might help as well.
I, too, have a ship of sorts. It isn't the most reliable of machines, but it's aged memory banks might contain something of use.
Are you beginning to believe that I'm telling the truth?
Let's see if the coast is clear.
I see it.
They won't do any good.
The bracelet overrides fear. Unless you're prepared to use them, they're quite useless.
Go back to the pod.
I am indeed. How do you do?
Another time, perhaps.
Down!
There are three at the moment. Fire those, we could have a dozen to contend with.
Our friendly neighbourhood axe man.
He might get lucky. Could hit an opening mechanism on the other side. Hang on.
There must be some sort of trigger for the escape hatch.
No.
Yes.
I just hope this part of the pod isn't buried. Are you ready?
Get down!
Let's go.
Well, you can't rest yet.
The miller. Of course. Why didn't I think of that?
Oh, it's him I'm interested in, not his horse. He comes and goes from the house as he pleases. Maybe he can help us. Why don't you go back to the Tardis and start work on the booster while we look for him.
Well, you're more than capable.
We may not be able to find the miller. We can't afford to waste any time.
And I'll be back as quickly as I can.
Now then, which way to the mill?
Just direct me, then. You can wait here for the poacher and his friend.
Hello!
We're here to see the miller.
Ah, good day. I'm the Doctor. You must be the miller.
Er, I'd like a word with you. We'll only keep you a moment.
No, no. Let him go.
Nothing in there. Let's get back to the Tardis, help Nyssa.
At once.
We haven't got the plague. I can help you. Wait. Listen.
Not again.
Thank you! I'm the Doctor. I can help
The headman was wearing a bracelet.
Yeah, for the Terileptils.
Not as their prisoner.
It might be more subtle.
Well, you'd better snatch it back again quickly. The headman's coming. I want to get his bracelet off.
We have no choice. Free of it, we might be able to reason with him.
Yes, yes, of course, of course. But first I would like to thank you very much for saving our lives.
It was worth a try.
Oh, dear. How is he?
He'll be all right.
There must be some way out of here. Adric and Tegan are depending on me.
Here, let me try.
Tegan?
Concentrate, Tegan. You can override the effects. Concentrate hard. Get back to the Tardis and tell Nyssa what's happening.
You'd better prepare yourself for a shock.
I don't think you'll have seen anything quite like a Terileptil before.
It's all right. How do you do? I'm the Doctor. Are you in charge here?
Sorry, it's just I'm quite concerned about a couple of friends I left here. I've already seen Tegan, but I'd like to know that the boy Adric is
Well, that's unfortunate, because we had intended to help you.
To get back to your own planet, yes.
Not at all.
So you've been to prison. What does that matter?
There's only one place in the universe a Terileptil can acquire such scaring. The tinclavic mines on Raaga.
Terileptian law was never my strong point.
I see your point, but there are countless uninhabited planets you could settle on.
You're highly intelligent. You have your android, your skills. Your way of life wouldn't remain primitive for long.
I can take you anywhere you want. A billion light years from your home planet. You'd never be found.
I can't let you do that.
The Tardis is a very temperamental machine, needing very careful handling.
You didn't take very good care of your own ship.
I gather it's break-up made an impressive spectacle.
There are only four of you?
Against the millions who already live on this planet? You'd never establish yourself here.
Genocide.
You'll find their annihilation more difficult than you think, and the Tardis will not help you.
Ahem.
He is one untrained man. What will you do when they send thousands of their soldiers against you?
A neat idea, dressing the android up as Death.
Yes.
I saw him in action in the stable.
Tell me, what happened to the occupants of this house?
I've never been able to reconcile the Terileptil's love of art and beauty with their love of war. Don't I qualify for a bracelet?
Cruder but more effective, hey?
Oh, I know, but by your admission these people are still primitive. What's your excuse?
Oh, for a proper key.
Someday I must get a proper survival kit together.
It isn't my day, is it.
I feel as though you've just killed an old friend.
Why not smile and let me live?
You overestimate me.
The poor old black rat and his flea.
But you'd need thousands of them.
I thought the local plague was already doing that?
Then who will serve you?
This carnage isn't necessary.
That's hardly an argument.
Tegan, I know you never listen to a word I say but, please put the cover back on the cage. You can do it. Just concentrate and you can override the control. Think hard! Cover the cage!
No, Tegan, don't! Please, listen to me! It's the Doctor. Don't open it! If you do it's the end for us all!
Tegan! Tegan, we haven't got time to fight.
How are you feeling?
Steady. You'll be all right.
I'm the Doctor. Take it easy.
How do you feel, now?
Oh, almost your old self.
It's more likely the electrical charge I gave him. So, what am I to do about these?
Will this be any good?
Open the cage and find out.
Oh, yes.
The Terileptils find it disturbingly easy to justify themselves. How are you doing with that lock?
Er, just a moment more.
You're right. Stand back.
I said, stand back.
I never miss.
Try the door.
You see?
The master control is overriding the switch. Stack some of these empty boxes up along here.
Just stunned.
They've gone.
A nearby city. Which is the nearest city?
Have a look around. See what papers you can find.
Will you! Just look around. There might be something.
You wouldn't.
Or Terileptian script. You know, I didn't realise their technology was so advanced.
What? Oh, yes.
It doesn't matter.
Ah, this is it. Let's see them replace this in a hurry.
The control panel. I've disconnected it.
Oh, we'll find it.
Let's get back to the Tardis.
So's this.
Ah, we'll try this one.
If you abandoned some of that junk, you might.
It's stuck.
It's been sealed. We'll have to find the back door.
Help, if we're lucky.
I don't know.
It may be the only glimpse you ever get of my Tardis.
So, you got here at last.
I like long walks.
Well, I knew the booster would work in theory, but practice is another matter.
Ah, in search of our Terileptil.
Yes, yes, that's why I'm searching.
Wait and see.
That's it!
The Terileptil base.
It's an electrical emission from a piece of scientific equipment. Not something you'd expect to find in seventeenth century Earth.
Because I wasn't looking for it until I found it.
Here's an old friend.
When a miller's cart stands outside a bakery, it isn't hard to deduce where the miller is.
Almost as if we were expect.
Good evening.
You were expecting me.
I brought the android as well.
The gun's about to explode!
Quick, everyone out of here!
Too late! That's the soliton machine exploding.
Wait! Quick, everything into the flames.
We must go. Our presence here would raise too many awkward questions. Can we drop you anywhere?
Into the Tardis!
Oh, a keepsake.
Good luck.
I have a sneaking suspicion this fire should be allowed to run its course.
I'll explain someday.

Just get on with it. It's all part of the initiative test.
Well?
Be concise.
Oh, very succinct.
You tell me.
It's a surprise.
Let me guess. Benzine, arsenic, boring things like that.
No, they're all used as preservative agents in the art of taxidermy.
Did you know Darwin suffered from seasickness?
It's odd, that, considering his origins.
Ace! Don't touch that!
You'll give us away. These days, trespassers end up in Newgate.
Yes. It took me three weeks to try and get out the last time. Now give me that phone. Get off.
Er, sorry, wrong number.
Well, now that you've so successfully drawn attention to our presence, there's only one thing for it.
Victorians are sticklers for etiquette.
Did you tell me that?
How many have you been in?
The front door's this way.
Ace.
What do you make of that?
It's your initiative test.
Ah, the name wasn't thought up until 1912. I can get you a badge if you like. Ask me another.
Looking's one thing.
Very slightly.
There is no safe level.
Well, let's hope he abandoned it before he came to any harm.
Zulu assegai. Quite lethal.
Here. I wouldn't touch it if I were you. This is my friend Ace, and I'm the Doctor.
Really? So am I, several times over.
Excuse my young friend. She comes from a less civilised clime.
Be quiet, noble savage. I'm sure in Central Africa you've seen far grislier sights than Ace's ankle.
Well, your boots, then. You're a big game hunter, I take it.
You are?
The snuff box.
R F C.
And he hasn't been seen since.
How long did you say he'd been living in this house?
I thought it might.
That wouldn't be a Chinese fowling piece, would it by any chance?
Tell me what else you found.
Describe it. It's all right, I'm a Doctor.
A bright light?
His mind's snapped. He's seen something too big to handle and snuff out. A light. I think we'd better go get some help.
How do you do, I'm the Doctor and this is my friend
We don't want him hurt.
My friend, Ace and I
Given a chance it could be Bedlam. Thank you, er?
Nimrod. Thank you Nimrod. We would be delighted.
How do you do. How nice of you to come.
Oh, this is my friend Ace.
No such luck. Quiet, Eliza. Now be a good girl. I'm making some small talk.
Ah, Nimrod, yes. There's still some tea in the pot if you'd like to go and get a couple of cups. Thank you very much.
Yes. Thank you, Nimrod.
Never mind, I'll have him completely bewildered by the time I'm finished.
[to Gwendoline] We've had some trouble with our carriage and Ace can't go to dinner dressed like this.
So I wonder if you have any appropriate apparel that she may borrow?
Yes, let me guess. My theories appall you, my heresies outrage you, I never answer letters, and you don't like my tie.
Ah, Josiah Samuel Smith, I take it. Dust to dust. I'm The Doctor and this is
Fascinating moths.
Yes, adapt or become extinct, Ernest.
Nevertheless, I suggest you concede to my wisdom and button it.
Why don't you just read Darwin instead of condemning him.
That's no way for a Victorian lady, gentlemen to behave.
Stay back.
(to Ace) Cover your eyes!
Redvers, what did you see?
But he may need help.
I wanted to see him.
Only the madmen may see the path clearly through the tangled forest.
Yes. The finest example I've seen this side of the Stone Age.
Darwin's theories. They turned nineteenth century science on it's head.
Yes, that was always his specialty.
I know a nice little restaurant in the Khyber Pass.
Having trouble with your connections? Perhaps I can help.
On the other hand, I have an emergency of my own. Excuse me. Time to emerge.
Ace! What's the matter?
So?
Ace!
Ace.
You were thirteen. You climbed over the wall for a dare.
Remind me what it was that you sensed when you entered this deserted house. An aura of intense evil?
I can't stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places, full of lost luggage and lost souls.
Then there's unrequited love, and tyranny, and cruelty.
We all have a universe of our own terrors to face.
But don't you want to know what happened here?
You've learned something you didn't recognise when you were thirteen.
The nature of the horror that you sensed here.
Come back to dinner, Ace.
I think you cared a lot, Ace.
Tell me what you saw.
Tell me, Ace.
Yes. It can't be easy being so far away from home, struggling to adapt to an alien environment.
Yes.
I'm not interested in money. How much?
(whistles) Now that's what I call Victorian value. But I'm still not interested in money.
Beetles and bluebottles.
Java?
Your father, is he there?
Gwendoline, do you know where Ace is?
Josiah, where's Ace?
What, to murder your enemy? I'm not your pet executioner. Ace is in trouble.
Good night, sleep tight. Up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire, otherwise known as Java. Well, not tonight, Josiah-phine!
Your puppet show doesn't fool me. Sorry to spoil your big game hunt, but Ace need my
Help.
Right, Josiah. Let's get down the rabbit hole. Get that lift!
Open those doors! Quickly!
At the end of the tunnel. Get a move on. Ace?
Where haven't I been. I came as quick as I could.
Ace, you haven't been tampering?
That's my girl.
No, keep him covered.
Shush.
Oh, not a patch on the Flying Scotsman.
Better not to move him.
He disturbed whatever's hibernating inside.
Because you know what's in there, don't you, Josiah?
Don't worry. I always leave these things to the last moment. These husks. Old cast-offs of yours, I take it?
Yes?
Genetic codes.
You've done a lot of exploring in here, haven't you, Josiah?
Yes, and the real owner won't be pleased when it wakes up.
Oh no, you're not. You're just part of the cargo.
I try.
(sotto) Just do what I do when I do it.
Oh dear, oh dear. Skeletons in the cupboard. Husks in the cellar.
Now, now, don't shout. You'll never evolve into a nice Victorian gentleman if you shout.
Yes. Not much improvement on the reptile, is he?
Well, I think congratulations are in order.
Quick, get up! Move! Move!
Ah, how do you do. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Ace.
Depraved or deprived? There, there, Control. There, there. Now, which of you is the Jekyll and which is the Hyde?
It's been a hard day's night. He's evolving again, to his next stage.
We won't see them till nightfall.
He sounded a little husky.
Yes.
Oh, don't rush me, Gwendoline. The sun has got its hat on, and we've got all day before Uncle Josiah dare show his face.
Yes. He doesn't like light, either.
Yes. I fixed it. Uncle Josiah knows as much about it's secrets as a hamburger knows about the Amazon desert.
Let her go. Come on, Ace. We've only just started. Now, there's one thing you haven't told me. What was it that frightened you so much when you entered this house in a hundred years time?
Time to call out the constabulary. Now, Inspector, perhaps you can assist us with our enquiries.
Snap out of it, Nimrod. If I didn't know better I'd say this was deliberate. Ten minutes was all it took to wake up the more sophisticated, civilised, police inspector.
I didn't say owned, I said inhabited.
He will appear.
Neanderthal.
He's mesmerised.
Yes, especially when roused.
I'm busy, Inspector.
Still not found the mustard?
This is Inspector MacKenzie from Scotland Yard. He was sent here in 1881 to investigate the disappearance of the owner, Sir George Pritchard.
Yes, he's been in Josiah's cupboard ever since. Preserved, hypnotised. Humour him.
Inspector? This is my friend, Ace.
I like the dress.
Still no change. Still out like a light. Light!
The fang of the cave bear calls you, Nimrod. Tell me your tale.
No, these are his own experiences.
Good idea. But try and be back by six.
Yes.
Around here, the forces of darkness don't wait until midnight to appear.
I know.
I mended it. It's very clever, climbing up the lift shaft, but I had hoped that Control creature might bring something with it, and for that it will need the lift.
Quiet. Josiah Samuel Smith and Control are frightened of it. Redvers Fenn-Cooper saw it and lost his mind. Nimrod, he worships it.
It's asleep down there in its spaceship and Josiah doesn't want it awoken.
It's very, very old. Perhaps even older. Just one chat.
Gone to see a man about a god.
Yes. Things are hotting quicker than I anticipated. Quick, run and get Inspector MacKenzie.
All civilisation starts with hunting and foraging, but don't worry, you'll work your way up. You must excuse me. Things are getting out of control.
Nimrod, where's Ace?
Stick around. I'll save you a trip.
Let's just say I've made a deal with its agent.
That'll be them now. Where's Ace got to? It's not dark yet, but I don't want Josiah to miss the show.
That's quite enough of that.
Cut the homespun twaddle, Nimrod. It's not wise. I've lit the blue touch-paper and found there's nowhere to retire to. Ladies, I do hope you enjoy indoor fireworks.
Hmm. I'd stand back from that lift, Nimrod, if I were you. To catch a wolf, I may have unleashed a tiger.
Ah, Josiah. So you've finally evolved into a Victorian. How quaint. And Ace, you've made it in time.
Oh, don't apologise. Come and meet Josiah's new guest.
Much too late for that. It's now time to shed a little light on your plans.
Don't worry, Ace.
No, but I'm about to find out. You can come out now! We're all waiting!
Thank you for trusting me, Control.
Light?
Josiah, come back! Er, how do you do? I'm the Doctor. This is my friend Ace, and I hope you slept well.
That's just it's shape here on Earth. It's called Light, and it's come to survey life here.
And while it slept, the survey got out of control.
And the survey is Josiah.
That was my idea.
I wouldn't want to confuse you.
No, Light. Don't!
That was unnecessary.
Josiah, withdraw with your people.
We'll talk.
How many more times, Light? This is Earth. I mean, why don't you check the instruments in your spaceship? Where has he got to now?
He travels at the speed of thought.
That's life.
Things ran away with themselves.
Light, Light, give her a break. She's not your real troublemaker.
Yes, just like you, only I didn't get caught napping. Why don't you forget the survey, Light, and go!
No.
Just our imaginations.
Yes. It's the energy from Light's ship. Invigorating, isn't it?
What does it remind you of? All right, all right, all right. What happened here in a hundred years time is none of my business.
It is.
Of course.
The Tardis key. You can always wait for me there.
Well, come on, then.
Having fun, Control?
Control, I've come to help you and to ask you for your help.
No, Control, don't!
Come back! Bah. You won't get far!
Oh, things are getting out of control. Even I can't play this many games at once.
I haven't got time, Redvers.
Really? And who's sponsoring the expedition, Josiah Samuel Smith?
A good hunter always knows the signs, like a royal invitation to Buckingham Palace, perhaps. Why else do you think Josiah has kept you alive so long, Redvers?
Not yet. I've got to find Ace.
Gwendoline, who does this remind you of?
Severe trauma. I could forgive her arranging those little trips to Java
If she didn't enjoy them so much.
Good. Just in time for dinner.
Good evening, Josiah. (to Ace) Don't have the soup.
Who was it said Earthmen never invite their ancestors round to dinner?
Oh, which reminds me. Lady Pritchard, have you seen this?
It belongs to your daughter Gwendoline. And there's a portrait of you in there, you see? Very nice likeness. You and Sir George must have been very happy before the cuckoo invaded your nest.
No soup, Ace.
I knew it was a trap as soon as I walked in to it. Unfortunately, your guest of honour seems to have let you down.
Josiah, tell me about your plan to assassinate Queen Victoria.
Myself, mostly.
Confusion, wastage, tyranny, burnt toast, till all the atlas is pink.
But it isn't your invitation to Buckingham Palace. Redvers?
In 1983? Ace, you didn't tell me that.
Ace.
He only wanted to take over an Empire. At least he didn't want to destroy the world.
Light, I think I've solved your problem for you.
So you started with Inspector MacKenzie.
Primordial soup, the most precious substance in the universe, from which all life springs.
But you evolve too, Light.
Of course you do. You change, adapt, all the time. Your attitude, your place, your mind. I mean, look at you now. You're no longer your original shape. And I don't think much about your catalogue. It's full of gaps.
What about the gryphons, the basilisks?
You missed the dragons, the bandersnatches. Then there are the slithy toves and the crowned Saxe-Coburg.
I can't think how you missed them. You have to complete the catalogue before you can destroy all life here.
She's no use to you now. She's evolved as well.
All is change, all is movement. Tell me, Light, haven't you just changed your location?
What's the matter, Light, changed your mind?
I suppose I could. It would make a change.
Even remains change. It's this planet. It can't help itself.
Subject for catalogue. File under Imagination comma lack of.
Ah.
A very big explosion, very soon.
Ace, don't touch that.
Look.
How does this ship travel?
Yes. Light's gone. The ship survives, along with a new crew.
Josiah, the ship doesn't want you to.
There go the rungs in his evolutionary ladder.
Explode or fly. I mean, after all, it is a spaceship.
You're busy. Must fly.
Come on.
Take off? They've gone, like a passing thought. As long as their minds don't wander.
He's dispersed.
The house will remember. Just the ghost of an evil memory lingering. A dark secret after the candle is out.
An evil older than time itself.
Any regrets?
Yes?
Wicked.

There we are. Home.
It's all right. Chesterton made the position quite clear. Now, I have some work to do.
Hush, child. Say your goodbyes and remember, we shall be leaving almost immediately.
Enough time has been wasted bringing you back, young man. I have the universe to explore.
Hmm. Still here?
Quite unnecessary.
Certain? Of course I'm certain. If you doubt me, take a look for yourselves.
Perhaps that will satisfy you.
Thank you. Obviously you're still in doubt. Let us take a longer look, through the trees, hmm?
Then I expect it is Somerset, my dear. Well, if you're going, be off with you.
It's out of the question. I refuse to leave the ship.
Entirely different circumstances! I'm rather tired of your insinuations that I am not master of this craft. Oh, I admit, it did develop a fault, a minor fault on one occasion, perhaps twice, but nothing I couldn't control.
Very simple. Quite simple.
Yes. Yes, well perhaps, since you put it that way, an hour or two won't come amiss. Susan, bring my stick will you?
I'm going to see Ian and Barbara back home safely.
Well?
Are we going to stand here talking all night, hmm? Hmm?
Perhaps it was a rabbit. Do you know, Chesterton's getting quite jumpy these days. Young man like him shouldn't suffer from nerves.
Come here, my boy. Where are we? Where do you live, hmm?
Come along, answer my questions, boy.
Paris, eh? A hundred miles or so either way is to be expected. After all, it's only a fraction of the distance we've covered. It's quite accurate, in fact.
Oh, nonsense. Let's have a word with the boy. Now look here, my boy. Hold still
You don't say.
Chesterton, there's a house. Look, straight ahead of us.
Oh, rubbish, rubbish.
Nonsense. It was your idea to explore, anyway. Besides, that might be very interesting. The walk will do us good.
It looks uninhabited. I wonder if we can get in?
I say, take a look through there, will you? I think your eyes are sharper than mine.
We're in luck. The door's unlocked.
I'll take upstairs and you search down.
Help! Can you hear me?
Hello! Hello! Can you hear me? Get me out!
Yes. Thank you. Oh, It's most refreshing. Where are my fiends, hmm?
Oh. Oh, very brave boy.
Yes, I think so. Thank you. It's quite remarkable. How could I ever begin to thank you?
Oh, it's a tragic business.
Yes, I must rescue my friends.
You saved me, my boy, so I must rescue them. Now you can understand that, can't you?
Yes, yes, yes. Now, you're the head of the house. Yes. Yes, well I oh, thank you. Thank you for everything. And what's your name?
I shall remember. Yes. Jean-Pierre. Au revoir, Monsieur Captain.
Good day. Pleasant day, sir.
I wonder if you can assist me. I'm bound for Paris. Am I still on the right road?
Splendid. Splendid. I was beginning to have my doubts. I haven't seen a soul for hours.
Yes. Further than you would think.
Oh, so they're not volunteers, eh?
Yes, quite a responsibility.
Yes, I see you believe in drastic measures, eh?
I'm sure you're very experienced at this job, my man. But, as an impartial onlooker I think I might have a bit of an advice to give you.
Well, if you were to expend your energy helping with the road, instead of bawling and shouting at them every few seconds, you might be able to get somewhere. Good day to you, sir!
Well, without any undue modesty, yes! Now, would you mind standing aside?
I am not in the habit of
Common fellow.
It's the tenth time he's counted his wealth.
Do any of you got any money, hmm?
You want to leave here, don't you?
Well, do as I say. Follow me.
Ah! Ah, ha! Yes, there it is.
We're waiting for the eclipse, look.
Yes.
Yes, you've heard about it, haven't you?
Yes. It's quite a phenomenon, isn't it? Yes.
Ah! Look! Look at the coin!
I've just found this coin down there. It must come from some hidden treasure.
No, no, definitely a hidden treasure.
Just there. Just there.
Catch his spade! Stop!
Good day to you, sir! Pleasant dreams.
Good evening.
Yes, yes, very likely.
Hmm? Oh, no, no, I didn't.
Yes, splendid fellow. You seem to be very interested in these traitors.
Then perhaps you can confirm that newly arrested prisoners are taken to the, what is it, the Conciergerie Prison? Hmm?
Yes, I was thinking of something new along these lines.
That's very impressive.
Yes, I'm quite aware of that. Yes, quite aware. Yes. In fact, it's a post that I myself personally occupy.
Don't apologise. I want to try that on.
The price is of no matter. I haven't any money.
No. No, I though possibly we could arrange an exchange.
What's wrong with it?
A fancy dress? My dear sir, I doubt that you've seen a coat like it.
Am I correct to assume that you're not interested?
Have you had a similar coat like this in your shop?
Then I can understand why there has been no call.
Exactly. Of course.
You may have it, providing you agree to let me have parchment and writing materials into the bargain, hmm?
Then we have a bargain, my dear sir.
Let me in, you fools! I could have you shot at dawn. Get it open, will you?
Ah, that's better. Thank you. Open again? You don't want all the prisoners to escape, do you?
Who is in charge of this prison, hmm? Well, speak up, my man!
My credentials.
And while we are about it, why wasn't I met, hmm? Do you realise that I walked through the whole of Paris without a guard? Me?
You were advised! I forwarded the communication myself. What if Robespierre hears about this?
Very well. Very well. Thank you. Yes. You seem a capable man and I'm sure this misunderstanding is none of your doing.
Of course, of course. And I'm glad we understand each other.
No, thank you.
Thank you, citizen! It's all perfectly simple. Three traitors were brought here. A man, a woman and a young child. They fled from my province. I'm sure you remember them?
Well? If they're still here.
What? By whom?
Yes.
Yes. Of course, if course. And the man? You haven't mentioned him.
Well, come along. Out with it, man.
Yes, yes, yes, I believe what you say. I'm sure you did the best you could. It's a pity you're surrounded by such fools.
Yes. All three of them are somewhere in Paris.
Yes. Yes. What? Oh, of course. Yes, yes, of course, of course. Well, I'll take up no more of your time, citizen.
Well, er, home.
Yes. Yes, I could do that.
A great help. Very well.
I welcome the opportunity. Thank you. Before you question me, perhaps you would like to hear my views on Paris?
Just today.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Oh, you've reached that conclusion. Hmm. Well, perhaps we have fewer enemies in our region, and it maybe that Paris can take an example from us, hmm?
Is there such a need, Citizen Robespierre? Hmm? I mean, what can this reign of terror possibly gain? For every opponent you put to the guillotine, two more will spring up!
Oh, you do, do you?
Do they? Or is it just their wish to keep their heads, hmm?
No we didn't, did we, and I was so looking forward to it. It's a pity we talked for so long about Paris.
I didn't say half the things I wanted to say. He twisted my words.
Oh, I think not. No, nom no, no. Your hospitality has been most successful, and most accepted. No, I think I must bid you goodbye and leave you.
Then convey my apologies to him.
It's out of the question!
Definitely no longer.
I'm sure it will be.
Oh, that's alright, Jailer. I don't think I shall stay after all.
No, I'm sure LeMaitre will understand. It's a pity that I asked him to put me up. Besides, those poor soldiers will need their rest.
Nevertheless, I must be on my way. I have a long journey. So kindly give my regards to LeMaitre.
And just what do you think you're doing, jailer? Hmm?
And what do you think he'll say when he hears you delayed me, hmm?
Very well, I'll stay then. And I shall say nothing of this disgraceful behaviour, if only for your sake.
I did not! The bed was hard, and the draught blew through the room like the north wind.
Yes, I dare say you are, but if I catch rheumatism, apologies won't cure it. Will it, hmm?
Most appropriate.
What's that?
My dear Barbara!
You should know by now, young lady, that you can't get rid of the old Doctor as easily as that.
Oh, never mind about that now.
What happened? Where's Susan? How is she?
She's here?
Is she well?
Good. Well now, we must find Chesterton and try and get back to the ship.
Hmm?
Oh yes?
Yes, that's it! That's it!
Oh, don't blame yourself, Barbara. As it happens, everything has turned out very well. Might have taken us ages to find each other.
Well, my voice seems to carry some weight, hmm?
Yes, it's rather impressive, isn't it? Now, listen. I'm going through that door. Give me a few minutes, then I want you to go through the door and straight out of the prison.
Absolutely serious, but I've no time to explain. Just do as you're asked.
Well, I'll look after her and follow later.
Now, now, now, there's no buts. Don't argue. You know my plans always work perfectly. Hmm? In a few minutes, then.
Ah, tell me. Is LeMaitre here?
Oh, dear, dear, dear. How irritating. And I did want him so urgently.
No, no, no, this matter can't wait. It's urgent. I've just been interrogating that young woman, and I'm convinced she's a member of that dangerous Traitor's Party.
And do you know, she could tell us the names of every traitor in this country.
No, no, chance of that. No, she'd rather die first than betray her friends. No, I think, if there's only some way of using her. If only we could get through her to her friends.
Hmm?
Perhaps what?
My dear, what an excellent idea! What an excellent idea! Yes, of course, now why didn't I think of that? Yes, that's what we'll do, and LeMaitre will be delighted! Now look here, Mister Jailer, I want you to open those prison doors. Keep out of sight.
Tch, tch, tch. No buts, no! And sooner or later, that young woman will come through those doors and we can grab her. Go along, quickly.
Susan, Susan, it's me, child! Me!
Oh, I can't explain that now, child, it'd take too long.
Yes, well, I've taken care of that. She should be out of the prison and well on her way now. And I. Shh! There's someone coming! Quiet! See you later. Shh! SUSAN: Be careful!
Shh!
Hmm?
Me? Certainly not!
But I was under the impression, my dear man, that you were doing so. I'm hardly dressed in the proper clothes to go skulking after people, now am I?
Well why didn't you say that in the first place? Well, did you?
No, and what do you think LeMaitre will say? He's bound to want to know whose idea it was.
I'll try. Now, don't worry, I'll cover up for you. But you know, I have a feeling that this young girl is tied up in this somehow. Now I think if we let her go, I personally could follow, and then arrest all of them. All I need from you is the key to that child's cell.
LeMaitre, LeMaitre. Why can't you use your own initiative, my man?
I demand you open that cell door!
Susan.
I shall have you out of here soon, but I must have your help. Now look, I want you to get down onto the floor, behind this door, and don't move, whatever you do!
Do it now, child. Don't argue, do it now. And don't make a sound! Stay there! There's someone coming.
Yes, yes, don't fuss.
Oh, he's not back yet then, eh?
Hmm. Jailer! Jailer! That young girl, she's gone!
She's gone!
Come along, child, quickly!
Oh, spare your breath, please! I'm quite capable of explaining the situation myself.
I must insist that you release that young child immediately!
Position, sir? Do you realise who you're talking to?
No. Should I?
Do you know that's the biggest fairy story I've ever heard in my life.
Yes. Why didn't you? (puts the ring on his finger)
It's become quite obvious to me why you didn't wish me to leave the prison.
But you relaxed the regulations today, and I could have walked out any time I wished.
So you knew all the time?
What do you want?
The least I can do is listen.
I have never met the man! Oh, I fully appreciate why you must want to find him, but if you think that I am going to betray him, then you are a very poor judge of character.
Never, sir, I refuse!
We came alone, my boy. We made a bargain. Let him speak. He holds Susan prisoner.
That's all very well, LeMaitre, Stirling, or whatever your name is, but the only reason I brought you here was to help Susan. And I've kept my part of the bargain.
I certainly will not! I want my granddaughter out of that prison!
But look here.
Very well. Very well. If you must, tell your story then get on with it.
Nonsense! It's far too risky.
Quite so, and there's Susan to think about.
Our only concern now is Susan.
Oh, save your breath, my dear. Do as you think fit. I'm going off for Susan.
Hmm?
Go with him, my boy. You can't help me but at least you can make sure that he helps us.
What is it? What do you find so amusing, hmm?
I've told you of our position so often.
The events will happen, just as they are written. I'm afraid so and we can't stem the tide. But at least we can stop being carried away with the flood! Now, Susan and the prison.
I think we're going to have quite a storm.
Hmm. We've waited around here long enough. It's far too conspicuous. I think the carriage might be here when I return. Will you be all right?
I think I'll go and get Susan, or at least try. Be careful.
I can see you did not expect me.
Really? I see you haven't heard the news yet, my man.
Yes. And LeMaitre was shot trying to run away.
Shot. And now we're going to deal with his accomplices.
Why do you think a high-ranking official like myself came to Paris, hmm? I was part of the plan. I came to make sure of Robespierre's downfall.
No, you didn't, did you? And that is why you didn't expect me to come back. You thought you'll get away with it.
Being LeMaitre's accomplice. Take him! You were LeMaitre's accomplice, weren't you? You did help him to carry out his torturous actions?
Orders? Orders? Don't tell me that, my man, I was there, remember? I saw you conniving with him all the time.
Didn't what?
It was you that betrayed me to LeMaitre, was it not?
Well, I suppose there's some logic in that. I can't decide whether you're a rogue or a half-wit or both. Ha. However, I will give you the benefit of the doubt. (to the guards) Get out. Now, while we're reconsidering the post of jailer you may stay here in a temporary capacity.
I hope not. Now, Robespierre's friends smuggled him away after the convention. The soldiers are after him. He will be caught and probably brought here.
Tomorrow there will be a new bunch of prisoners, Robespierre's friends, so I hope everything will be ready, including the cells?
Certainly. Now let me have the key to the dungeon.
Ah. There, Susan. We're all going back to the ship. It's all over for you.
Well, Barbara's outside and Ian should arrive at any moment. We have a carriage waiting.
Yes. I.
They've just heard about the downfall of Robespierre. A sort of celebration, you know?
Yes. Yes, Susan. The rabble are far too busy to bother about us. Everybody lived in fear yesterday of that man, and today. Let's go, Susan. Let's go.
Now come along. Don't stand around. It's too dangerous.
Well, I can assure you, my dear Barbara, Napoleon would never have believed you.
Well, it's hardly fair to speculate, is it? No, I'm afraid you belittle things. Our lives are important, at least to us. But as we see, so we learn.
Well, unlike the old adage, my boy, our destiny is in the stars, so let's go and search for it.

Who wants fish and chips?
I'll drop you both off. Take your time. Don't rush.
Nope.
Solar tsunami. Came directly from your sun. A tidal wave of radiation. Big, big, big.
Well, the gyrator disconnected. Target tracking is out.
Assume the position!
Textbook landing.
Behold, a cockerel! Love a cockerel.
And underneath, a monastery. Thirteenth century.
These fissures are new. Solar tsunami sent out a huge wave of gamma particles. This is caused by a magnetic quake that occurs just before the wave hits.
Yeah, for now.
Yeah. It's a supply pipe. Ceramic inner lining. Something corrosive. They're pumping something nasty off this island to the mainland.
Who isn't? Right, let's go. Satisfy our rabid curiosity.
I think we're here. This is it.
Hmm?
Accident? Yes, I know. Accident.
Acid. They're pumping acid off this island. That's old stuff. Fresh acid, you wouldn't have a finger.
There are people coming. Well, almost.
Almost people.
Well, at the moment they fall into the or what category.
Well, we've halted. How are we all doing on the calm front?
Well, I'm the Doctor, and this is Amy and Rory, and it's all very nice, isn't it?
Actually, you're in big trouble.
Since you were hit by a solar wave.
Just, by the look of it. And there's a bigger one on the way.
You're not a monastery, you're a factory. Twenty second century army-owned factory.
I need to see your critical systems.
You know which one.
And there you are.
Mind, soul?
You said it could grow. Only living things grow.
Stop it. Strange. It was like for a moment there it was scanning me.
I understand.
Incredible. You have no idea. No idea. I mean, I felt it in my mind. I reached out to it, and it to me.
How can you be so blinkered? It's alive. So alive. You're piling your lives, your personalities directly into it.
It's the solar storm. The first waves come in pairs. Pre-shock and fore-shock. It's close.
Well, I can see why you keep it in a church. Miracle of life.
Did I mention the solar storm? You need to get out of here.
Well, I can get you all off it.
It's coming.
How do you get power?
Big problem.
Please, you are making a massive mistake here. You're right at the crossroads of it. Don't turn the wrong way. If you don't, if you don't prepare for this storm, you are all in terrible danger. Understand?
I need to check the progress of the storm. Monitoring station? Monitoring station.
Thank you.
Waves disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. There is going to be the mother and father of all power surges. See this weathervane, the cock-a-doodle-do? It's a solar router feeding the whole factory with solar power. When that wave hits, ka-boom. I've to get to that cockerel before all hell breaks loose. I never thought I'd have to say that again. Amy, breathe.
Cleaves, you're not in your harness.
You've lost all power to the factory.
Then let's go get them.
How long would you say we were unconscious for, Cleaves?
I'd hazard we've been out a teensy bit longer.
An hour. I've seen whole worlds turned inside out in an hour. A lot can go wrong in an hour.
Your Gangers. They've gone walkabout.
It would seem the storm has animated your Gangers.
Not ransacked, searched.
Their stuff.
Confirmation. They need to know their memories are real.
They feel compelled to connect to their lives.
No, bequeathed. You gave them this. You poured in your personalities, emotions, traits, memories, secrets, everything. You gave them your lives. Human lives are amazing. Are you surprised they walked off with them?
Who taught you to do this?
Well, your Ganger's granddad taught him to do it, too. You both have the same childhood memories, just as clear, just as real.
Scared, disorientated, struggling to come to terms with an entire life in their heads.
Are you a violent man, Jimmy?
Then why would the other Jimmy be?
You told me we were out cold for a few minutes, Cleaves, when in fact it was an hour.
Well, it's not your fault. Like I said, they're disoriented. Amy, when you got to the alcoves, who was in harness?
Jennifer?
It's hot.
Trans-matter's still a little rubbery. Nerve endings not quite fused properly.
It's okay.
You will. You'll stabilise.
You don't have to hide. Please, trust me. I'm the Doctor.
That's it. Good, you remember. This is early Flesh. The early stages of the technology. So much to learn.
She can't stabilise. She's shifting between half-formed and full-formed, for now at least.
Let her go.
Rory?
Oh, Rory. Rory! Always with the Rory.
No, no, no. We haven't got time. Back, back, back!
Of course, Jennifer's a Ganger too.
But I did say they were scared and angry.
I have to talk to them. I can fix this.
It is too dangerous out here with acid leaks.
Yes. I'm going back to the Tardis. Wait for me in the dining hall. I want us to keep together, okay. No more wandering off.
Well, it would be safer to look for Rory and Jennifer with the Tardis.
Exit?
I'm a great parker.
Oh. What are you doing down there?
Hello. How are you all getting on?
Well, we have two choices. The first is to tear each other apart. Not my favourite. The second is to knuckle down and work together. Try to work out how best we can help you.
Now, I know its hard for you to hold your fully human form. That's why you keep shifting between the Flesh stages, but do try. It'll make the others less scared of you.
Until the Doctor gets here. Hello.
Before we do anything, I have one very important question. Has anybody got a pair of shoes I could borrow? Size ten. Although I should warn you, I have very wide feet.
The Flesh was never merely moss. These are not copies. The storm has hardwired them. They are becoming people.
Bless you. We were all jelly once. Little jelly eggs sitting in goop.
We are not talking about an accident that needs to be mopped up. We are talking about sacred life. Do you understand? Good. Now, the Tardis is trapped in an acid pool. Once I can reach her, I can get you all off this island, humans and Gangers, eh? How does that sound?
Look, I'm not going to lie to you. It's a right old mess, this. But as you might say up North, oh well, I'll just go to't foot of stairs. Eee by by gum. Or not. Good. Right. First step is we get everyone together, then get everyone safe. Then, get everyone out of here.
Cleaves, no. No, no.
It's interesting you refer to them as it, but you call a glorified cattle prod a she.
Give me the probe, Cleaves.
Argh! He's dead!
You stopped his heart. He had a heart. Aorta, valves, a real human heart. And you stopped it.
Wait, wait, just wait.
Wait! Look at what you have done, Cleaves.
The most fortified and defendable room in the monastery. Cleaves, the most fortified and defendable room in the monastery.
Thank you.
You've crossed one hell of a line, Cleaves. You've killed one of them. They're coming back, in a big way.
We'll worry about the flares when we're locked inside. Rory, Pond.
Well, if she's got any sense, then she's hiding. Rory!
Rory.
Amy.
Amy, they are not after him, they're after us.
Show yourself. Show yourself!
Yes. Yes, it's insane, and it's about to get even more insanerer. Is that a word? Show yourself, right now!
Correct in every respect, Pond. It's frightening, unexpected, frankly a total, utter splattering mess on the carpet, but I am certain, one hundred percent certain, that we can work this out. Trust me. I'm the Doctor.

Quiet, Ace. I'm working.
Yes.
A cry in the dark.
A cry for help. Perhaps a summoning.
Earth. Rippling out through the cosmos, forward in time, backwards in time and sideways in time.
Yes, sideways in time, across the boundaries that divide one universe from another.
For? I don't know.
Earth. A few years in your future.
We'll know in a moment, once we've deciphered it.
Too late. We've already arrived.
I don't think this'll stop either.
North east.
Ah, archaeological dig?
The beginning of something terrible.
Blowing the occasional chunk out of the earth keeps them amused.
Yes. The transmission's definitely coming from over there.
A nuclear missile convoy.
It has a graveyard stench.
Close.
What we need is something to help us.
Wait a minute. Ah yes, of course! I never thought I'd need these again.
This should remove a few obstacles.
Oh, never mind. Just think like a physicist.
Now, what seems to be the problem?
Well, you've had an explosion in your electronics, haven't you?
Caused by?
Yes, well, they are conspicuous.
Exactly.
I'd just like to say three things.
Yeti, Autons, Daleks. Cybermen and Silurians!
She didn't even notice. Among all the varied wonders of the universe there's nothing so firmly clamped shut as the military mind.
We could have walked to the hotel, you know.
Vortigern. That's an interesting name.
What's your name, by the way?
There are many secrets in names. Vortigern is old British for High King.
Yes. I'd like to book a room. One for myself and one for my young friend here.
Er, quite a distance, as it happens.
Why not. What do you have?
Really?
Glass of water, please. Ace?
Ace?
Hello, I'm The Doctor, and this is my friend
Remember, we are in the future.
There, a five pound piece.
Do you mind? It's a very valuable piece of coinage.
Mmm. Very knowledgeable fellow.
Well, he is an archaeologist.
The point of archaeology is to carefully recover the past, not disintegrate it.
How remarkable.
Yes.
My, it's hot. No, no. Now it's cold.
What kind of feeling?
Waiting for something, or someone.
Mister Warmsly, just the person.
This scabbard.
This scabbard. Where did you find it?
Where?
What period?
No, no, no. It's been waiting around longer than that.
Good idea. Did you see it?
And?
A bloke, flying through the air?
You two, stay here.
Shush.
Yes.
No, it's a human.
You recognise my face, then?
Time for what?
Vortigern's Lake, of course. Can you walk?
Well, if my hunch is right, the Earth could be at the centre of a war that doesn't even belong to this dimension.
Listen, Winifred. We've got to be somewhere urgently, so please get out of the way.
I can sort this out. Look, if I can just explain.
Winifred, this is not the way.
Listen, now that we're all here, let me introduce myself. I am the Doctor and this is
Do you recognise me?
I am the master of time. I cannot be bound so easily.
Yes, remember Baden and my mighty arts. Do you think I would use mere trickery against someone as formidable as you? Go, before I unleash a terrible something on you.
That was Mordred, and his mother is Morgaine, a mighty sorceress.
Never met them before.
Brigadier Bambera, if we're going to work together, you've got to stop shooting at everything that moves.
Oh, ignore them. They're just establishing their credentials.
Don't worry about them.
Sorcery.
No one's to go outside.
Exactly.
There are things out there in the dark you wouldn't want to meet.
What happened to you?
I doubt that.
Which way does that wall face?
Stay where you are.
I don't know, but I've got some nasty suspicions.
No. Someone is creating a rip in the fabric of time and space.
Yes. I'm uniquely sensitive. Argh! Gah!
(through gritted teeth) I hear you.
I cannot allow your interference.
Good morning.
And you excavated all this yourself?
Impressive.
And where did you find the scabbard?
It says, Dig Hole Here.
My handwriting. Ace, we need a hole.
Er, sixty seconds should be long enough.
Nothing to worry about. My young friend's something of an expert.
No, explosives.
Down!
Ace?
One of these days we're going to have a nice long talk about acceptable safety standards.
With a bit of luck, a tunnel.
Probably.
Indubitably.
Peter, Ace and I are going to investigate this tunnel. You stay here and guard it. Don't let anyone come in here.
Yes.
Well, we are under the lake.
Hmm. It's gone soft with age. This was built in the eighth century.
No, they didn't.
Don't worry, Ace. It's only a trap.
Ancelyn's people must have built this tunnel.
This is no place for humour.
Hmm?
Another dimension. Sideways in time from another universe.
The question is, how do we get through here?
No hidden switches.
Open up. It's me.
Well, it came to me that it wasn't Ancelyn's people who built this tunnel. It was Merlin.
Exactly. Door keyed to my voice pattern. Just the sort of thing I would do.
No. But I could be, in the future. That is, my personal future. Which could be the past.
More than that. It's a craft for travelling between dimensions.
It wasn't built, it was grown.
Very advanced bioengineers.
Magic.
What is Clarke's law?
Well, the reverse is true.
Don't be so cynical, Ace.
Impressive.
The legendary Arthur, yes. From another dimension, where the man was closer to the myth. But what is he doing here?
Who knows?
Ace, don't touch that.
No, Ace!
I hope you haven't disturbed anything.
Well, I only hope you haven't disturbed anything else!
Like that. Look!
I think I saw something over there.
Ace, I think it's time for plan B.
Yes, run!
Now is not the time to panic!
Now we panic!
Yes. When I say run, run!
Not that way!
Hang on, Ace.
I'm coming!
Come out, come out, wherever you are, you little tapeworm.
(cough) Oh.
Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. So you recognise me, then?
It let me out.
Same as ever, eh, Brigadier?
Don't worry, Brigadier. People will be shooting at you soon.
We might run into trouble.
Something's wrong.
We haven't been attacked yet.
Yes.
As long as Morgaine's people are shooting at us, she won't be using more obscure methods of attack.
I don't know, and I don't want to find out.
Brigadier, tell Bambera she's in trouble.
You're very angry.
And you want to leave.
Of course you want to leave.
I wouldn't stand for any nonsense, if I were you.
I wouldn't dream of it.
She seems to have disappeared.
You've got enough weapons here to fight a war.
It'll be useless, Brigadier.
A non-stick bullet.
No silver?
Well, you never know.
A shadow.
No, Brigadier, this is important.
It must be the source of Arthur's power.
Could be.
They're alive?
Towards the missile convoy.
But if they lead Morgaine's troops
If there's an accident. We'd better stop any engagement. Have you got a helicopter available?
Ah ha! Bessie!
Ace, things may get dangerous, so I want you to have this.
It is. I got it from the dartboard. But it will protect you against Morgaine's sorcery.
A piece of chalk. At the first sign of anything strange, I want you to draw a chalk circle, and you and Shou Yuing stay inside it along with Excalibur.
And remember, stay inside the circle. Don't leave it until I return.
Trust me. Ready, Brigadier?
Appearances can be deceiving, Ace.
And remember, look after Excalibur and stay in the circle.
Does it say anything about Ace and Shou Yuing?
I'll deal with that later. First, I've got to put an end to this bloodshed.
Good idea.
Stop! I command it! There will be no battle here!
Ace, what have I done?
Tell Morgaine to call off the Destroyer.
Your justice? Tell her to call it off or I will decapitate you.
I wouldn't count on it.
Brigadier, this is not the way.
Hold tight.
Ace!
Morgaine! If they're dead
Ace!
Ace? Shou Yuing?
What happened?
Yes, I get the idea, Ace. Where's Excalibur?
Good.
Exotic alien swords are easy to come by. Aces are rare.
I don't know. Which way did Morgaine leave?
I wonder.
At the other end of that interstitial vortex.
Well, first we go through this. Brigadier, I'll go first. Ace
Correct. And you. Now, high drama is very similar to comedy. It's all a matter of
Timing.
Morgaine.
Brigadier.
That was uncalled for.
You haven't won the game yet, Morgaine.
Who said anything about playing chess? I'm playing poker.
And I have an Ace up my sleeve.
What is it to be, Morgaine? Who do you fear more?
Don't be a fool.
But I thought she was bluffing.
You fool, Morgaine.
Do you think this'll solve anything?
About time.
Brigadier, you're going the wrong way. Ace!
That, Brigadier, was the beginning of the end of the world.
It's no good. It's not good at all.
It's no good, Brigadier. Conventional weapons won't harm it.
Ace, give me the silver bullets.
Silver bullets'll do the trick.
It's all a matter of timing, Ace. Give me your gun.
Simple, isn't it? Just like most killings.
We've got to stop him.
You stupid, stubborn, pig-headed numbskull. You were supposed to die in bed. I could have handled it, done your job.
You're supposed to be dead.
Well
Doris?
Ha, ha, ha. So she caught you in the end.
Yes, just a small nuclear missile bogged down in a nature reserve.
Ancelyn, replace Excalibur and Arthur will arise.
Ace, have you no sense of occasion?
This is very odd.
I will put him there.
What does it say?
Who signed it?
Ah well, that sorts that out.
Tut. I could have given myself more warning. Brigadier, you and Ace see to this ship.
Yes, we'll give Arthur a warrior's burial.
Is it? Not while there's an abort button.
If this missile explodes, millions will die, you will die.
All over the world, fools are poised ready to let death fly.
Is it? Death falling from the sky, blind, random, anywhere, anytime. No one is safe, no one is innocent?
Then put a stop to it, Morgaine. End the madness.
Arthur is dead.
He's dead, Morgaine.
No.
Don't you?
He died over a thousand years ago.
Gone.
He's gone to dust.
I'm sorry, Morgaine. It's over.
Time and Time Lords wait for no man.
Ah, Brigadier. Before Mordred recovers, lock him up. And while you're at it, lock up his mother.
Peaceful, isn't it?
Oh, just admiring the garden.
I think the battle may be about to begin.
I thought you said this was a piece of antiquated junk?
Yes.
Allow me.
I'll cook supper.

Get down!
Did they see you?
But did they see you?
Martha, it's important. Did they see your face?
Off we go!
Argh! They're following us.
Stolen technology. They've got a Time Agent's vortex manipulator. They can follow us wherever we go, right across the universe. They're never going to stop, unless. I'll have to do it. Martha, you trust me, don't you?
Because it all depends on you.
Take this watch, because my life depends on it. This watch, Martha. The watch is
Come in.
No, it's all right, it's all right. Put it down. I was er. Sorry, sorry. Sometimes I have these extraordinary dreams.
I dream I'm this adventurer. This daredevil, a madman. The Doctor, I'm called. And last night I dreamt that you were there, as my companion.
I'm a man from another world, though.
This thing. The watch is
Ah, it's funny how dreams slip away. But I do remember one thing; it all took place in the future. In the Year of Our Lord two thousand and seven.
Mmm, that's me. Completely human.
Headmaster.
Advanced with little impediment. The French were all but spent, with only two battalions of the old guard remaining. A final reserve force was charged with protecting Napoleon, but by evening, the advance of the Allied troops had forced them to retreat.
Yes, hi.
There we go.
No, no, I've got it, no. Er, how best to retrieve? Tell you what. If you could take these
No harm done. So, er, how was Jenkins?
Oh, we can't have that.
Yes, so you are. Sorry, sorry. Just let me.
Ah, brilliant idea. Brilliant. Perfect. Division of labour.
Don't we just.
Yes. This way.
I always say, Matron, give the boys a good head of steam, they'll soon wear themselves out.
Ah. Nurse Redfern it is then.
Joan?
Well, obviously.
Yes, yes, it is, yes.
I hadn't thought about it.
Well, I should imagine that you'd be, er, I mean, I never thought you'd be one for. I mean, there's no reason why you shouldn't. If you do, you may not. I, I probably won't, but even if I did then I couldn't. I mean I wouldn't want to
What about the stairs?
Because it hurts.
No, it was just a tumble, that's all.
I was just telling Nurse Redfern, Matron, about my dreams. They are quite remarkable tales. I keep imagining that I'm someone else, and that I'm hiding.
They're almost every night. This is going to sound silly.
I dream, quite often, that I have two hearts.
I have er, I have written down some of these dreams in the form of fiction. Not that it would be of any interest.
Well, I've never actually shown it to anyone before.
It's become quite a hobby.
Oh no, no, she's just an invention. This character, Rose. I call her, Rose. Seems to disappear later on.
Ah, that's the box. The blue box. It's always there. Like a like a magic carpet. This funny little box that transports me to far away places.
Mmm.
I sometimes think how magical life would be if stories like this were true.
It's just a dream.
Anything wrong, ladies? Far too cold to be standing around in the dark, don't you.
All gone. Commonly known as a meteorite. It's just rocks falling to the ground, that's all.
No, no, no. No, they always look close, when actually they're miles off. Nothing left but a cinder. Now, I should escort you back to the school. Ladies?
Then I shall bid you goodnight.
Get down! They're following us. They can follow us wherever we go. Right across the universe. They're never going to stop. Martha, you trust me, don't you?
Because it all depends on you. Martha, this watch is me.
Those creatures are hunters. They can sniff out anyone, and me being a Time Lord, well, I'm unique. They can track me down across the whole of time and space.
They can smell me, they haven't seen me. And their life span'll be running out, so we hide. Wait for them to die.
That's why I've got to do it. I have to stop being a Time Lord. I'm going to become human.
Never thought I'd use this. All the times I've wondered.
Chameleon Arch. Rewrites my biology. Literally changes every single cell in my body. I've set it to human.
Now, the Tardis will take care of everything. Invent a life story for me, find me a setting and integrate me. Can't do the same for you. You'll just have to improvise. I should have just enough residual awareness to let you in.
Oh, yeah. It hurts.
This working? Martha, before I change, here's a list of instructions for when I'm human. One, don't let me hurt anyone. We can't have that, but you know what humans are like. Two, don't worry about the Tardis. I'll put it on emergency power so they can't detect it. Just let it hide away. Four. No, wait a minute, three. No getting involved in big historical events. Four, you. Don't let me abandon you. And fi
And twenty three. If anything goes wrong, if they find us, Martha, then you know what to do. Open the watch. Everything I am is kept safe in there. Now, I've put a perception filter on it so the human me won't think anything of it. To him, it's just a watch. But don't open it unless you have to. Because once it's open, then the Family will be able to find me. It's all down to you, Martha. Your choice. Oh, and thank you.
Good lad. Yes. Yes! The Definitive Account of Mafeking by Aitchison Price. Where did I put it? And I wanted a little word. Your marks aren't quite good enough.
Now, be honest, Timothy, you should be the very top. You're a clever boy. You seem to be hiding it. Where is that book? And I know why. Keeping your head low avoids the mockery of your classmates. But no man should hide himself, don't you think?
You're clever. Be proud of it. Use it.
The secret lies within. I'm trapped. I'm kept inside the cogs.
In the dark, waiting. Always waiting.
Fascinating details about the siege. Really quite remarkable. Are you all right?
Right then. Good. And remember. Use that brain of yours.
Power of a Time Lord.
You're really not looking yourself, old chap. Anything bothering you?
You are not alone. Keep me hidden.
Concentrate.
Hutchinson, excellent work.
Good day to you, Headmaster.
Permission granted.
Anything the matter, Baines?
Ah, Pemberton, Smythe, Wicks, take post.
Ah, Nurse Redfern.
No, no, no. You don't have to.
You still are.
Don't you think discipline is good for them?
Well, Great Britain is at peace, long may it reign.
That was just a dream.
Well then, we can be thankful it's not true. And I'll admit mankind doesn't need warfare and bloodshed to prove itself. Everyday life can provide honour and valour, and let's hope that from now on this, this country can find its heroes in smaller places.
In the most
Ordinary of, of deeds.
Lucky.
Nurse Redfern, might I invite you to the village dance this evening, as my guest?
Well, I discovered a talent, that's certainly true.
The devil.
Ah, now, there I have to protest, Joan. That is hardly me.
That scarecrow's all skewed.
Gallifrey.
Yes, it must be, yes.
Not at all, no. My father Sidney was a watchmaker from Nottingham, and my mother Verity was, er. Well, she was a nurse, actually.
Really? Right. Yes. Well, my work is done. What do you think?
All sorts of skills today!
Most definitely this page. Do you like it?
Well, that's how I see you.
That's not fair at all.
I've never er
Martha, what have I told you about entering unannounced?
Four. You. Don't let me abandon you.
Thank you.
Keep me away from the false and empty man.
You look wonderful.
I'm not certain.
Yes. Yes.
Martha, I've warned you.
What are you talking about?
Did I? I don't remember.
DOCTOR Oh, I see. Cultural differences. It must be so confusing for you. Martha, this is what we call a story.
Good. This is nineteen thirteen.
How dare, how dare you. I'm not going anywhere with an insane servant. Martha, you are dismissed. You will leave these premises immediately. Now get out!
The nerve of it. The absolute cheek. You think I'm a fantasist? What about her?
You've taken my arm in public.
Yes, of course. There you are.
I surprise myself.
Sorry.
Oh, now really, Martha. This is getting out of hand. I must insist that you leave.
Of course I'm human. I was born human, as were you, Baines. And Jenny, and you, Mister Clark. What is going on? This is madness.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I literally do not know
I don't know what you mean!

Ancient Rome. Well, not for them, obviously. To all intents and purposes, right now, this is brand new Rome.
Ha, ha.
Well, don't tell them that.
No, no, no, no. That's the Tardis translation circuits. Just makes it look like English. Speech as well. You're talking Latin right now.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not sure. You have to think of difficult questions, don't you?
Welsh. You sound Welsh. There we are. Learnt something.
Nah. Ancient Rome, anything goes. It's like Soho, but bigger.
Mmm. Ages ago. Before you ask, that fire had nothing to do with me. Well, a little bit. But I haven't got the chance to look around properly. Coliseum, Pantheon, Circus Maximus. You'd expect them to be looming by now. Where is everything? Try this way.
Pompeii. We're in Pompeii. And it's volcano day.
Okay.
You told me not to tell you.
Hold on.
Excuse me. Excuse me. There was a box. Big blue box. Big blue wooden box, just over there. Where's it gone?
But it wasn't yours to sell.
Who'd you sell it to?
Thanks.
What'd he buy a big blue wooden box for?
Ha. I've got it. Foss Street's this way.
What do you want a bell for?
It's 79AD, twenty third of August, which makes volcano day tomorrow.
Yeah, except we're not going to.
Not this time. Pompeii is a fixed point in history. What happens, happens. There is no stopping it.
Says me.
Tardis, Time Lord, yeah.
You stand in the market place announcing the end of the world, they'll just think you're a mad old soothsayer. Now, come on. Tardis. We are getting out of here.
Oh, I bet you will.
Whoa! There you go.
But that's me, I'm a visitor. Hello.
I am Spartacus.
Oh no, no, no. We're not, we're not married.
Really?
And that trade would be?
That's good. That's good, because I'm the marble inspector.
Nothing to worry about. I'm, I'm sure you've nothing to hide. Although, frankly, that object looks rather like wood to me.
Ah, well. Caveat emptor.
I'm sure it's fine, but I might have to take it off your hands for a proper inspection.
Don't know what you mean, Spartacus.
Oh, Spartacus, for shame. We haven't even greeted the household gods yet.
They don't know what it is. Vesuvius is just a mountain to them. The top hasn't blown off yet. The Romans haven't even got a word for volcano. Not until tomorrow.
Donna, stop it.
And that's my fault?
But the wind is felt most keenly in the dark.
I concede that every sun must set.
And yet the son of the father must also rise.
Oh, yes. But don't mind me. Don't want to disturb the status quo.
We'll be off in a minute.
You've got to.
Oh, now that's different. Who designed that, then?
Where'd you get the pattern?
Made of stone.
Oh, ha. You must excuse my friend, she's from Barcelona. (sotto) No, but this is an age of superstition. Of official superstition. The Augur is paid by the city to tell the future. The wind will blow from the west? That's the equivalent of ten o'clock news.
No, no, I'm not. I meant no offence.
Consuming the vapours, you say?
It doesn't look like it to me.
I beg your pardon?
How did you know that?
No, no, no, no. Let her talk.
Oh, not this time, Lucius. No, I reckon you've been out-soothsayed.
What?
Who is? Who's she?
Different sort of hypocaust?
Who thought of that?
Didn't you think of moving away? Oh no, then again, San Francisco.
What's that noise?
But after the earthquake, let me guess. Is that when the soothsayers started making sense?
Haven't they said anything about tomorrow?
No, no. No reason. I'm just asking. But the soothsayers, they all consume the vapours, yeah?
Ipso facto.
They're all consuming this.
Tiny particles of rock. They're breathing in Vesuvius.
Quintus, me old son. This Lucius Petrus Dextrus. Where does he live?
Let me try again. This Lucius Petrus Dextrus.
Where does he live?
Only if you don't tell mine. (He goes inside then leans out.)
Pass me that torch.
Well, plenty of marble merchants in this town. Tell them all the same thing, get all the components from different places, so no one can see what you're building.
Put this one there. This one there. Er, keep that one upside down, and what you got?
What, the soothsayer doesn't know?
Yeah, I knew you were going to say that. But it's an energy converter.
I don't know. Isn't that brilliant? I love not knowing. Keeps me on my toes. It must be awful being a prophet, waking up every morning, is it raining? Yes, it is, I said so. Takes all the fun out of life. But who designed this, Lucius, hmm? Who gave you these instructions?
Lucius, really, tell me. Honestly, I'm on your side. I can help.
Oh, morituri te salutant.
Come on now, Quintus, dignity in death. I respect your victory, Lucius. Shake on it? Come on. Dying man's wish?
Show me.
Armless enough, though. Whoops.
Quintus!
Run!
No sign of them. Nice little bit of allons-y. I think we're all right.
What was that?
No, it's closer.
Footsteps.
Footsteps underground.
Caecilius? All of you, get out.
I think we're being followed.
Just get out!
Water. We need water. Quintus. All of you, get water. Donna!
Talk to me. That's all I want. Talk to me. Just tell me you are. Don't hurt these people.
Talk to me. I'm the Doctor. Just tell me who you are.
Carapace of stone, held together by internal magma. Not too difficult to stop, but I reckon that's just the foot soldier.
I thought your son was brilliant. Aren't you going to thank him? (sotto) Still, if there are aliens at work in Pompeii, it's a good thing we stayed. Donna? Donna? Donna!
Oh, that'll be the day.
Well, that's all right. Just us girls. Do you know, I met the Sibyl once. Yeah, hell of a woman. Blimey, she could dance the Tarantella. Nice teeth. Truth be told, I think she had a bit of a thing for me. I said it would never last. She said, I know. Well, she would. You all right there?
I like the toga.
Yeah, not so much.
Let me tell you about the Sibyl, the founder of this religion. She would be ashamed of you. All her wisdom and insight turned sour. Is that how you spread the word, hey? On the blade of a knife?
Oh, very perceptive. Where do these words of wisdom come from?
They've done far more than that. Might I beg audience? Look upon the High Priestess?
If I might?
Does it hurt?
Who told you that?
Exactly. The people of Pompeii are turning to stone before the volcano erupts. But why?
More to the point, why don't you know about it? Who are you?
No, no, no, no. I'm talking to the creature inside you. The thing that's seeding itself into a human body, in the dust, in the lungs, taking over the flesh and turning it into, what?
Oh, but you can read my mind. You know it's not. I demand you tell me who you are.
Name yourself. Planet of origin. Galactic coordinates. Species designation according to the universal ratification of the Shadow Proclamation.
Tell me your name!
Well, that's a Pyrovile, growing inside her. She's a halfway stage.
That thing in the villa. That was an adult Pyrovile.
I warn you, I'm armed. Donna, get that grill open.
Just. What are the Pyrovile doing here?
Right, creatures of stone shattered on impact. When was that, seventeen years ago?
Okay, so seventeen years ago woke you up, and now you're using human bodies to reconstitute yourselves. But why the psychic powers? HIGH PRIESTESS: We opened their minds and found such gifts.
Okay, that's fine. So you force yourself inside a human brain, use the latent psychic talent to bond. I get that, I get that, yeah. But seeing the future? That is way beyond psychic. You can see through time. Where does the gift of prophecy come from?
Now get down.
Yes, down there. Why can't this lot predict a volcano? Why is it being hidden?
Yeah, but it's got to sting.
Get down there!
This way.
Into the volcano.
Yes, way. Appian way.
Still part of history.
Some things are fixed, some things are in flux. Pompeii is fixed.
Because that's how I see the universe. Every waking second, I can see what is, what was, what could be, what must not. That's the burden of a Time Lord, Donna. And I'm the only one left.
Stop it.
Twenty thousand.
They know we're here. Come on.
It's the heart of Vesuvius. We're right inside the mountain.
What's that thing?
That's how they arrived. Or what's left of it. Escape pod? Prison ship? Gene bank?
Oh, it's worse than that.
Come on.
Well, we can't go back.
Now then, Lucius. My lords Pyrovillian, don't get yourselves in a lather. In a lava? No? No. But if I might beg the wisdom of the gods before we perish. Once this new race of creatures is complete, then what?
What do you mean, gone? Where's it gone?
Yeah, I should warn you, it's seventy percent water out there.
Then the whole planet is at stake. Thank you. That's all I needed to know. Donna.
See? The energy converter takes the lava, uses the power to create a fusion matrix, which welds Pyrovile to human. Now it's complete, they can convert millions.
Of course I can, but don't you see? That's why the soothsayers can't see the volcano. There is no volcano. Vesuvius is never going to erupt. The Pyrovile are stealing all its power. They're going to use it to take over the world.
I can invert the system, set off the volcano, and blow them up, yes. But, that's the choice, Donna. It's Pompeii or the world.
If Pompeii is destroyed then it's not just history, it's me. I make it happen.
Vesuvius explodes with the force of twenty four nuclear bombs. Nothing can survive it. Certainly not us.
Push this lever and it's over. Twenty thousand people.
It was an escape pod.
Come on.
Don't you think I've done enough? History's back in place and everyone dies.
No, it's not.
That's just it. Don't you see, Donna? Can't you understand? If I could go back and save them, then I would. But I can't. I can never go back. I can't. I just can't, I can't.
Come with me.
It's never forgotten, Caecilius. Oh, time will pass, men'll move on, and stories will fade. But one day, Pompeii will be found again. In thousands of years. And everyone will remember you.
The explosion was so powerful it cracked open a rift in time, just for a second. That's what gave you the gift of prophecy. It echoed back into the Pyrovillian alternative. But not any more. You're free.
Oh, I was never here. Don't tell anyone.
Yeah. You were right. Sometimes I need someone. Welcome aboard.

I can't free the Tardis from the Time Corridor!
No, too much turbulence. Hold on. Things must stabilise soon.
Yes, yes, I know.
Not if I have anything to do with it.
The right moment. The time stress on the Tardis varies greatly. I'm waiting for the right moment to break out of the Time Corridor.
Too late, Tegan. Hold on.
Hold on!
Hold on.
We're free.
For the moment. Are you all right?
Well, the instruments are still affected by turbulence, but I think it's 1984, London. Found it!
The Time Corridor. I want to find out what all this is about.
Such neglect. A hundred years ago this place would have been bustling with activity.
Come on. Trouble with you, Tegan, you have no imagination.
What?
He'll be all right.
He must have come down the Time Corridor.
What happened?
Who's controlling the Time Corridor?
Relax. I'm going into the warehouse.
Perhaps they can tell us what's going on, hmm?
Look around.
Recently fired.
Why advertise who you are, hmm?
Turlough?
Turlough!
Turlough!
Turlough!
Er, yes, I'm sorry about this. A friend of mine wandered in here by mistake, and we're looking for him.
Interesting. You don't disbelieve us, do you?
What have you discovered?
What have you found?
Tell me! Alien objects?
A side effect of the Time Corridor.
Don't harm her, please. She's a friend.
A Dalek. Take cover!
Aim for the eyepiece, the stalk at the top of the dome.
Quickly!
Open the door!
Stand clear!
While you're doing that, I'd like a hand with the debris outside.
How is she?
Who discovered these cylinders?
Have you tried to open one?
It would be an enormous coincidence if they didn't.
You must get reinforcements.
I'll come with you.
I won't be long. I must get back to my ship.
I must find Turlough.
No, no, no, no. There is isn't time. Turlough's on board the Dalek ship.
Be careful.
It was, or at least, the remains of one.
We have to find it before it tries to kill again.
True, so why are you being so tentative in your search?
Precisely. That's why we're searching the warehouse.
Oh, you won't mistake it. The moment you find it, it'll try and kill you.
Temporarily disconnected, I would think.
Nothing, nothing. Go on with the search.
Would you care to take a look? How is he?
The Dalek wasn't quite dead, I'm afraid. Here, take this.
We must get back to the Tardis. I have to find the Dalek ship.
I need your help.
Well, you can take this opportunity to show me. Come along.
Yes, I know.
It's bigger inside than out.
Don't worry, soon be over.
That's it. I've located the Dalek ship. Now, I could drop you off at the warehouse when I collect Tegan.
Good man.
Turlough?
Turlough? Foolish boy.
Quickly, let's get out of here.
This is madness. The Daleks won't thank you for capturing me. They'll kill you.
Without the threat of death, you're quite powerless, aren't you.
However you respond is seen as an act of provocation. I know the Daleks of old. And Davros. I assume he's about here somewhere.
Do you mean it can get worse?
But not yet. The Daleks need my brainwaves intact, don't they.
Why isn't Davros here? I would have thought he'd have wanted to see this.
So, he is here.
What will you do with my duplicate?
Oh, I think it does. I've grown rather attached to myself.
I assume my brainwaves are destined for Davros. You must need his services very badly.
Superior? It took you long enough to ensnare the Tardis in the Time Corridor.
Hmm. But Stien was more effective. A living, thinking being, not some tin-pot machine.
What?
Are you all duplicates?
Interesting. I wonder what happened to the real you.
Have the soldiers from the warehouse been duplicated?
It's very clever. Would you care to tell me how it's done?
Hmm, I thought not. What about Tegan?
She's harmless. You must release her.
Why?
Why are you doing this?
No!
Not staying till the bitter end? How disappointing.
Why do they take themselves so seriously?
Get on with it. I can do without your pity.
You ask it as though I have a choice.
I must have played truant that day. Or maybe we didn't go to the same school. Which school did you go to?
But you remember one of the Amendments. What was the First? It's very important I know. It's very important you remember, too. Think, man. Search the area of your mind the Daleks have shut off. Resist, before it's too late.
Resist!
Quickly, recite the Amendments. Remember your past.
You must resist. You're destroying my mind.
Quickly, release me.
We'll call them in here.
You'll be safe in the Tardis.
I'll take that chance.
Well, don't just stand there. Come and help.
Quickly. Come on.
Earth.
Why did the Daleks rescue Davros?
To kill Davros.
I must. Davros created the Daleks. He must not be allowed to save them.
Once before I held back from destroying the Daleks. It was a mistake I do not intend to repeat. Davros must die.
No.
All right. (to Tegan) Wait as long as you can, but should the Daleks attack, you leave at once.
I'm sorry to have detained you.
I'll say one thing for you, Davros. Your conversation is totally predictable. You're like a deranged child, all this talk of killing, revenge and destruction.
But to what end? Just more suffering for those unlucky enough to survive?
Until I walked through that door, I foolishly hoped you'd changed enough for me not to have to do this.
I'm not here as your prisoner, Davros, but your executioner.
Save your breath.
And compassion? Are they to be programmed for that?
But only to make the Daleks more efficient killers.
For destruction!
Which I do not accept.
Outside. Deal with them.
To be honest, I wouldn't know what to do with an army.
I lack your practice, Davros.
No, no, you need medical attention.
No, wait! Look, I can help you.
I'm an imbecile.
Well done.
The virus is only partial to Dalek. It would die once it's done its work.
Lunch has arrived for our friend here.
Open the doors.
It's over.
The Earth is safe, at least until the Daleks find an antidote for the Movellan virus.
You won't be able to invade Earth.
Your duplicates aren't stable. It won't work.
The Dalek ship has been destroyed.
The self-destruct device on the space station.
No, no. Stien, I would think. He must have finally decided which side he was on.
Oh, yes. Yes, given time they'll all be free of Dalek control.
Er yes. Yes, indeed. Come along.
I beg your pardon?
What's the matter?
You think I wanted it this way?
You want to stay on Earth.
Tegan
No, no, don't leave, not like this.
It's strange. I left Gallifrey for similar reasons. I'd grown tired of their lifestyle. It seems I must mend my ways. Come along.

Yo ho ho! Or does nobody actually say that?
Our sensors picked you up. Ship in distress.
Yes. Okay, problem word. Seventeenth century. My ship automatically, er, noticed-ish that your ship was having some bother.
Well, er, I want to say multidimensional engineering, but since you had a problem with sensors, I won't go there. Look, I'm the Doctor. This is Amy, Rory. We're sailors, same as you. Ooo ar. Except for the gun thing. And the beardiness.
I suppose that laughing like that is in the job description. Can you do the laugh? Check. Grab yourself a parrot. Welcome aboard.
If this is just because I'm a captain too, you know, you shouldn't feel threatened. Your ship is much bigger than mine. And I don't have the cool boots. Or a hat, even.
A bit more laughter, guys?
Where are the rest of the crew? This is a big ship. Big for five of you. I suppose the rest of them are hiding some place, and they're going to jump out and shout boo.
Amy, what are you doing?
Okay. Groovy. So not just pirates today. We've managed to bagsy a ship where there's a demon popping in. Very efficient. I mean, if something's going to kill you, it's nice that it drops you a note to remind you.
Amy! Everybody into the hold. Rory! Come on!
Okay. Just like a shark, in a dress. And singing. And green? A green singing shark in an evening gown.
Yeah, right. Cursed is big with humans. It means bad things are happening but you can't be bothered to find an explanation.
Well, it's not propelled by the wind.
And the gun's back. You're big on the gun thing, aren't you. Freud would say you're compensating. Ever met Freud? No? Comfy sofa.
Everyone out of the water!
She wants blood. Why does she want blood?
It's okay, we're safe down here. No curse is getting through three solid inches of timber.
Oh! Ah. Hello again.
I have my good days and my bad days.
Bilge water. She's using water like a portal, a door. She can materialise through a single drop. We need to go somewhere with no water.
He means the armoury where the powder's stored.
Good. Let's go there.
Ah. Worried because I'm wearing a hat now? Nobody touch anything sharp!
Someone else had the same idea.
Who's been sleeping in my gun room?
Who is he? What, he's not one of the crew?
Yep. Ignore my last theory.
It's not just blood, she's coming for all the sick and wounded, like a hunter chooses the weakest animal.
Humans. Second-rate. Damage too easily. It's only a matter of time before everyone gets bruised. My ship, it can sail us all away from here. You and me, we fetch it. Let's go.
It's not a curse. Curse means game over. Curse means we're helpless. We are not helpless. Captain, what's our next move?
We have to get Rory and Toby away. She's out there now, licking her lips, boiling a saucepan, grating cheese.
We've all got to go some time. There are worse ways than having your face snogged off by a dodgy mermaid.
Darkness? Demon? You can have first go.
Let me stop you there. Bigger on the inside. Don't mind, do you, if we just skip to the end of that moment? Oh, and sorry I lied, by the way, when I said yours was bigger. Kitchen that way. Choice of bathrooms there, there, there.
That does very, very complicated. That does sophisticated. That does whoa, amazing, And that does whizz, bang, far too technical to explain!
Atom accelerator.
No. Sort of. Yes.
Oh.
This is how the professionals do it.
Er, it's stuck. Not responding.
Mmm hmm. Yeah, apparently. That's new. You had to gloat, didn't you?
I saw that look just now. Ha, ha, his ship is rubbish.
It can't get a lock on the plane.
The space we travel in. The ocean. Sort of ocean but not water. The Tardis can't see. It's sulking because it thinks the space doesn't exist. Without a plane to lock onto we're not going anywhere.
Yeah, well, it's a big club. We should get T-shirts.
What's happening?
Okay, she's had her little sulk. Now she's heading for the full-on screaming tantrum.
Argh! The parametric engines are jammed. Orthogonal vector's gone. I'm almost out of ideas.
Well, we could try stroking her and singing her a song.
Hard to say. Never has before. I've lost control of her. She's about to dematerialise. We could end up anywhere!
Yes, it is! Out! Out now! Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
Okay, okay, okay. Tardis runs off on its own. That's a bit of a new one. Bang goes our only hope of getting them out of here.
He's got the last of the supplies. We should go after him.
Don't get injured. Don't get injured.
She's inside.
I was wrong. Please ignore all my theories up to this point.
We're all in danger. The water's not how she's getting in. When we were down in the hold, think what happened. You, me, Amy, Rory, leeches.
Yes, only when it grew still. Still water. Nature's mirror.
Yes. Not water, reflection.
That siren legend. The curse.
Folklore springs from truth. She attacks ships filled with treasure. Where else do you get a perfect reflection?
Hmm.
Amy! Open the door!
Open the door.
We've got to destroy every reflection. Gold, silver, glass, she could spring from any of them. Oh, yes, yes, I know, I know. Very bad luck to break it. But look at it this way. There's a stroppy homicidal mermaid trying to kill all.
Yep. Help me lug this lot out.
DOCTOR; The ocean.
Oh, good. For a moment there I thought it was yours.
Any reflection, any mirror, and the siren will attack. We have to protect Rory and Toby. Go and get the crown from the storeroom.
Not my most dynamic plan, I realise.
It's been towed.
Sorry. We might be stuck here for a while.
It's okay. The calm won't last forever. When the wind picks up we'll all set sail.
It's not one star, it's two. The Dog star, Sirius. Binary system.
I've travelled far, like you. Space can be very lonely, and the greatest adventure is having someone share it with you.
Who are you, Henry Avery? Respected naval officer, wife and child at home. How did you end up here, wandering the oceans with a band of rogues?
People stared at it for centuries and never knew. Things can suddenly change, when you're least expecting.
Shush.
Feels like something's out there, staring straight at me.
Man the sails!
You couldn't give up the gold, could you. That's why you turned pirate. Your commission, your wife, your son. Just how much is that treasure worth to you, man?
He's drowning. He's drowning! You go in after him, you'll drown too. There's only one thing that can save him now.
The Siren. The Siren, she wants him. We have to release her.
He's drowning. Go and find him!
If he stays in there he'll die.
That thing isn't just a ravenous hunter. It's intelligent. We can reason with it. And maybe, just maybe, they're still alive somewhere. We have to follow.
If we ever want to see them again, we have to let the Siren take us. We'll prick our fingers. All agreed? Yeah?
Aye.
We haven't moved. We're in exactly the same place as before.
No. It's real. Space ship trapped in a temporal rift.
Not the same. Two planes, two worlds, two cars parked in the same space. There are lots of different universes nested inside each other. Now and again they collide, and you can step from one to the other.
Good, because it's not like that at all. But if that helps.
All the reflections have suddenly become gateways.
Ever look in a mirror and think you're seeing a whole other world? Well, this time it's not an illusion.
Yes.
Uh huh.
And the Siren is on board.
Dead.
Same as us. A stowaway.
Human bacteria.
A virus from our planet. Airborne, travelling through the portal. That's what killed it. Didn't get its jabs. Urgh. Look.
Sneeze! Alien bogies.
The Tardis!
Wait. His fever's gone.
She's keeping him alive. His brain is still active, but all its cellular activity is suspended. It's not a curse, it's a tissue sample. Why get samples of people you are about to kill?
She's coming.
Anaesthetic.
The music. The song. So she anaesthetises people and puts their body in stasis.
Avery, no!
Fire. That's new. What does fire do? Burn? Yes. Destroy? What else? Sterilise! I sneezed. I've brought germs in.
Amy, stop. Don't interfere. Don't touch him. Anaesthetic, tissue sample, screen, sterile working conditions. Ignore all my previous theories!
She's not a killer at all, she's a doctor!
This is an automated sick bay. It's teleporting everyone on board. The crew are dead, and so the sick bay has had nothing to do. It's been looking after humanity whilst it's been idle. Look at her. A virtual doctor able to sterilise a whole room.
She's just an interface, seeped through the join between the planes, broadcast in our world. Protean circuitry means she can change her form, and become a human doctor for humans. Oh, sister, you are good.
She's keeping them alive, but she doesn't know how to heal them.
Tell her, Amy. Show her your ring. She may be virtual but she's intelligent. You can't do anything without her consent. Come on. Sophisticated girl like you. That must be somewhere in your core program.
Consent form. Sign it. Put your hand in the light. Rory's sick. You have to take full responsibility.
He can't breathe. Turn it back on.
You're in a hospital. If you leave, you might die.
The Siren will keep you safe.
Drowning, on the point of death.
We have to send this ship back into space. Imagine if the Siren got ashore. She would have to process every injured human.
I'm sorry. Typhoid fever. Once he returns it's only a matter of time.
Do you think you can sail this thing?
Come on. Come on, Rory. Not here. Not this way. Not today.
You still can. You can still do this. He believes in you. Come on, Amy. Come on!
Goodnight, Amelia.
I always worry about you.
Go to bed, Pond.
Oh, Amelia.

Go to your room.
Go to your room. I mean it. I'm very, very angry with you. I am very, very cross. Go to your room!
I'm really glad that worked. Those would have been terrible last words.
How was your con supposed to work?
Yeah. Perfect.
Take a look around the room. This is what your harmless piece of space-junk did.
Rose.
We're going upstairs.
I'll tell you what's happening. You forgot to set your alarm clock. It's volcano day.
I wish.
Have you got a blaster?
The night your space-junk landed, someone was hurt. This was where they were taken.
Let's find out. Get it open.
Nothing.
Sonic blaster, fifty first century. Weapon Factories of Villengard?
Once.
Like I said. Once. There's a banana grove there, now. I like bananas. Bananas are good.
What do you think?
Yeah. And?
Powerful and angry.
Me too.
Can you sense it?
Coming out of the walls. Can you feel it?
Funny little human brains. How do you get around in those things?
Rose, I'm thinking.
There are these children living rough round the bomb sites. They come out during air-raids looking for food.
Suppose they were there when this thing, whatever it was, landed?
Yes, you keep saying harmless. Suppose one of them was affected, altered?
It's afraid. Terribly afraid and powerful. It doesn't know it yet, but it will do. It's got the power of a god, and I just sent it to it's room.
End of the tape. It ran out about thirty seconds ago.
I sent it to it's room. This is it's room.
Go now! Don't drop the banana!
Good source of potassium!
It's from the groves of Villengard. I thought it was appropriate.
Bananas are good.
Come on!
It's keeping us here till it can get at us.
It is them. It's every living thing in this hospital.
I've got a sonic, er. Oh, never mind.
It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that.
It's sonic! Totally sonic! I am soniced up!
Screwdriver!
Could've used a warning.
I do.
What, you've never been bored?
Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?
Okay, that door should hold it for a bit.
Well, it's got to find us first! Come on, we're not done yet! Assets, assets!
Window.
So, where'd you pick this one up, then?
Okay. One, we've got to get out of here. Two, we can't get out of here. Have I missed anything?
I'm making an effort not to be insulted.
Okay, thanks, that really helped.
How're you speaking
To us?
Now there's a coincidence.
The child can Om-Com, too.
Anything with a speaker grill. Even the Tardis phone.
Loud and clear.
Trying to set up a resonation pattern in the concrete, loosen the bars.
Wouldn't bet my life.
Why do you?
You just assume I'm
You just assume that I don't dance.
Nine hundred years old, me. I've been around a bit. I think you can assume at some point I've danced.
Problem?
Well, I've got the moves but I wouldn't want to boast.
Rose, I'm trying to resonate concrete.
Barrage balloon?
You were hanging from a barrage balloon.
I've travelled with a lot of people, but you're setting new records for jeopardy friendly.
Hanging from a rope thousands feet above London. Not a cut, not a bruise.
Oh, we're calling him Captain Jack now, are we?
He's not really a Captain, Rose.
If ever he was a Captain, he's been defrocked.
You can spend ten minutes overriding your own protocols? Maybe you should remember whose ship it is.
This is a Chula ship.
Nanobots? Nanogenes.
Sub-atomic robots. There's millions of them in here, see? Burned my hand on the console when we landed. All better now. They activate when the bulk head's sealed. Check you out for damage, fix any physical flaws. Take us to the crash site. I need to see your space junk.
We were talking about dancing.
We've got to get past him.
Relax, he's a fifty first century guy. He's just a bit more flexible when it comes to dancing.
Well, by his time, you lot have spread out across half the galaxy.
So many species, so little time.
Dance.
Stay back!
The effect's become air-borne, accelerating.
Nothing.
Never mind about that. If the contaminants airborne now, there's hours left.
Till nothing, forever. For the entire human race. And can anyone else hear singing?
Of course they have. They think they've got their hands on Hitler's latest secret weapon. What're you doing?
It hadn't crashed last time. There'll be emergency protocols.
Captain, secure those gates!
Just do it! Nancy, how'd you get in here?
Show Rose. Setting two thousand four hundred and twenty eight D.
Reattaches barbed wire. Go!
What do you expect in a Chula medical transporter? Bandages? Cough drops? Rose?
Yes, you do.
It wasn't empty, Captain. There was enough nanogenes in there to rebuild a species.
Getting it now, are we? When the ship crashes, the nanogenes escape. Billions upon billions of them, ready to fix all the cuts and bruises in the whole world. But what they find first is a dead child, probably killed earlier that night, and wearing a gasmask.
What's life? Life's easy. A quirk of matter. Nature's way of keeping meat fresh. Nothing to a nanogene. One problem, though. These nanogenes, they're not like the ones on your ship. This lot have never seen a human being before. Don't know what a human being's supposed to look like. All they've got to go on is one little body, and there's not a lot left. But they carry right on. They do what they're programmed to do. They patch it up. Can't tell what's gasmask and what's skull, but they do their best. Then off they fly, off they go, work to be done. Because, you see, now they think they know what people should look like, and it's time to fix all the rest. And they won't ever stop. They won't ever, ever stop. The entire human race is going to be torn down and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child looking for its mother, and nothing in the world can stop it!
The ship thinks it's under attack. It's calling up the troops. Standard protocol.
They are now. This is a battle-field ambulance. The nanogenes don't just fix you up, they get you ready for the front line. Equip you, programme you.
It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes. All that weapons tech in the hands of a hysterical four year old looking for his mummy. And now there's an army of them.
Good little soldiers, waiting for their commander.
What's the matter, Captain? A bit close to the volcano for you?
I know.
I know. There isn't a little boy born who wouldn't tear the world apart to save his mummy. And this little boy can.
I don't know.
No.
How can it be your
Nancy, what age are you? Twenty? Twenty one? Older than you look, yes?
So it's volcano day. Do what you've got to do.
How old were you five years ago? Fifteen? Sixteen? Old enough to give birth, anyway. He's not your brother, is he? A teenage single mother in 1941. So you hid. You lied. You even lied to him.
He's going to keep asking, Nancy. He's never going to stop.
Tell him. Nancy, the future of the human race is in your hands. Trust me and tell him.
He doesn't understand. There's not enough of him left.
Shush! Come on, please. Come on, you clever little nanogenes. Figure it out! The mother, she's the mother. It's got to be enough information. Figure it out.
See? Recognising the same DNA.
Oh, come on. Give me a day like this. Give me this one.
Ha-ha! Welcome back! Twenty years till pop music - you're going to love it.
The nanogenes recognised the superior information, the parent DNA. They didn't change you because you changed them! Ha-ha! Mother knows best!
Taken care of it.
Psychology.
Good lad!
Change of plan. Don't need the bomb. Can you get rid of it, safely as you can?
Software patch. Going to email the upgrade. You want moves, Rose? I'll give you moves.
Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once, everybody lives!
Doctor Constantine. Who never left his patients. Back on your feet, constant doctor. The world doesn't want to get by without you just yet, and I don't blame it one bit. These are your patients. All better now.
Yeah, well, you know, cutbacks. Listen, whatever was wrong with them in the past, you're probably going to find that they're cured. Just tell them what a great doctor you are. Don't make a big thing of it. Okay?
Right, you lot. Lots to do. Beat the Germans, save the world. Don't forget the welfare state! Setting this to self-destruct, soon as everybody's clear. History says there was an explosion here. Who am I to argue with history?
The nanogenes will clean up the mess and switch themselves off, because I just told them to. Nancy and Jamie will go to Doctor Constantine for help, ditto. All in all, all things considered, fantastic!
Who says I'm not, red bicycle when you were twelve?
And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like this.
Go on, ask me anything. I'm on fire.
I'm sure I used to know this stuff. Close the door, will you? Your ship's about to blow up. There's going to be a draught.
Welcome to the Tardis.
You'd better be.
Rose! I've just remembered!
I can dance! I can dance!
I'm sure he would, Rose. I'm absolutely certain. But who with?

In here, Brigadier?
All right, Brigadier, you've had your little bit of mystification. Now I know where I'm supposed to stay, perhaps you we don't mind telling me why?
And?
I rather gathered that when we arrived. For a moment I thought they weren't going to let you in.
Makes what all the more puzzling? Come on, Brigadier, you can tell me.
People?
What are they working on here, anyway?
And what action have you taken so far?
That's fine, so long as no one steals the basket.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I see. I'm so sorry. Hello. How do you do?
Oh? What is?
Yes, I know how you feel. Still, he means well, you know.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Er, Smith. Doctor John Smith.
I'm sorry?
Doctor John Smith. How do you do, Miss Smith?
That? Oh, that, er, that contains my equipment, Professor.
You're the virologist, Miss Smith?
I read your paper on the teleological response of the virus. A most impressive piece of work.
Particularly when I realise you must have written it when you were five years old.
But you're going to try, aren't you.
Mmm hmm.
Why?
You realise this is a very dangerous place to be in?
I don't think.
Well, you can make yourself useful. We need somebody around here to make the coffee.
Professor!
Look, would you kindly desist? This is not a blackboard, you know?
Make myself a cup of coffee. Good day to you.
No, no. I'm the Doctor. You really must keep your glasses on the end of your nose, Professor.
She isn't?
I don't think I quite understand what you're talking about, Professor.
Yes, he said that she's in America.
Please be careful. This is very delicate equipment.
Shoot her?
That's my alarm clock.
It's a rhondium sensor. It detects delta particles. At a preset spectrum density of fifteen ams, it oscillates this little cylinder there, which promotes a vacuum in there which wakes me up. Clear?
Because I'm very fond of delta particles. Why do you ask so many questions?
If you'll allow me to do so. Good night, Miss Smith.
Tell the Brigadier what?
I think we can decide what to do about Miss Smith in the morning, Professor. If we're all still here.
Rubeish?
Rubeish!
Oh, it's all right. Nothing to worry about. Just checking.
You're asking questions again.
Rubeish!
Yes, but he was here a moment ago.
You stay here, Miss Smith. I'm going to check the landing.
Anybody come out here just now?
Shadows.
I can't understand why the definition was so low. Unless he's operating with a very weak power source at maximum range. Yes, of course.
Hello?
No. Professor Rubeish is missing.
Yes.
Well, I thought I saw a man in armour.
Mmm hmm.
Oh, I very much doubt it. Sorry I can't stop, Brigadier.
Well, I've got to get on the trail while it's still warm.
Oh no he hasn't. I just got a fix on him. There's something very odd indeed going on.
Someone's operating a matter transmitter. And the really odd thing is, there's a time transference too. It's being worked from several centuries ago. Past and present mixed up. Very interesting, that.
Well, I can't stay here chatting, old boy. Got to get after Rubeish.
Well, I got there, didn't I?
Brigadier, a straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. Goodbye, old chap.
Well done, old girl. Absolutely on target. For once.
How the blazes did she get here?
Sarah? Miss Smith. Come back!
Professor Morrison? Professor?
Absolute lunacy.
Rubeish!
It's me, it's the Doctor. Don't you remember? We were on the same landing at the research centre.
No, hardly. Look, Professor. What's wrong with all these people?
Well, you seem to be all right?
Yes, and very nearly blind.
Obviously working some sort of ocular device. Professor, have you any idea where you are?
Yes, well, you're in a castle all right. But do you know the time?
Now Professor, listen to me. This may come as a shock to you, so steel yourself. You have been brought back to the early years of the Middle Ages.
Yes, well, tell me about it some other time, will you? We've got to get out of here before Linx comes back.
Look, Professor, your life is in considerable danger, I must insist that you
Professor, don't you understand?
You know who I am?
To prevent your interference with the affairs of Earth. Don't you realise the harm that you'll cause?
That's a typically Sontaran attitude.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm just a tourist. I like it here.
You haven't seen it at its best.
Once again, a Sontaran philosophy.
Ah, yes. Yes, as I thought. A Sontaran warrior. So, the perpetual war between the Sontarans and the Rutans has spread to this tiny planet, has it?
Unfortunately.
Gallifrey. I am a Time Lord.
Oh, do you think so?
Yes, well, you'd be well advised never to put that appreciation to the test, Linx.
You seem to have acquired some help all ready.
From which you stole the equipment and the skilled help you couldn't find here.
Commander Linx, if you will return these people to their own time I might possibly consider helping you.
You're interfering with human evolution, Linx. Don't you realise the damage that you're going to do to them?
Human beings must be allowed to develop at their own pace. At this period, they're just a few steps from barbarism.
You give them breech-loading guns now, they'll have atomic weapons by the seventeenth century. They'll have the capability to destroy their own planet before they're civilised enough to handle it.
Rubeish! Professor, over here quickly.
A change of plan, old chap. Look, I want your help.
Look, behind me you'll find a panel. There's a switch on it.
Right, turn the switch.
No! No! That's the wrong. No, man!
Yes, so do I. It was the wrong one.
Yes, that was the one. Thank you very much indeed, Professor.
Smith. Yes, of course. Look, will you excuse me? I've got to go and find a young girl. I'll see you later, I hope.
Ah, good evening.
Thank you very much, Miss Smith. A most timely rescue.
You've been getting around, Sarah. Are you on visiting terms with all the local nobility?
Oh dear. You know, I'm afraid you're going to be awfully confused if you ask me to explain about the Tardis.
Yes, my police box. You were a stowaway, I imagine.
My dear girl, I'm not helping him. Linx is. I'm trying to stop him.
Yes, perhaps you're lucky enough not to have met him yet. Nasty, brutish and short just about sums him up.
Yes, well, he'd have looked even stranger if he hadn't been wearing space armour. He comes from a planet where the surface gravity is many times than of Earth.
Mmm hmm.
Because I never lie. Well, hardly ever. You ever heard of UNIT?
In an advisory capacity, yes. Well, they asked me to look into this question of the missing scientists for them.
My dear girl, I don't go around kidnapping scientists. No, Linx brought them here to staff his workshop. Now I've got to find a way of sending them back to there own time.
How do you do? It is a pleasure and a privilege to be in the company of civilised people at last.
Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you, not me. We'd be well advised to join forces against him.
That's a generous admission. Especially coming from one of the fair sex.
You offer a somewhat restricted choice, Sir Edward.
My services are at your disposal, sir. Such as they are.
On the contrary, sir, I think we can.
Yes sir, with just a few men I think I can persuade Irongron that we have a full garrison.
By creating an illusion, anyway.
It will be, sir.
Thank you, Sarah.
I told you there'd be plenty of work for everybody, didn't I?
You don't think mixing this singularly noxious compound is fun, do you? How's the rest of it going?
Excellent. I'm glad I decided to let you stay.
You know, I was never much of a hand with a paint brush myself.
No. Nor a palette knife for that matter. But I'd like to study under one of the masters one day. Rembrandt, preferably.
Mmm hmm.
Yes, within reason.
Because, my dear Sarah, I've got a job to do. One that involves the whole future of your species. Here, hold this will you?
Mmm hmm.
Yes, well, the definition of the word humanity was always a rather a complex question, wasn't it?
If you mean am I a native of the planet Terra, the answer is no, I'm not.
Me? I'm a Time Lord.
Yes, that's right. And my people are very keen to stamp out unlicensed time travel. You can look upon them as galactic ticket inspectors, if you like.
About what I do, yes. Not necessarily the way I do it. For example, you know what this is?
This is my own special smoking mixture, consisting of saltpetre, sulphur and fat. With a few little extras thrown in.
Ah. That is Irongron. Battle is about to commence!
I thought Linx would have to come along. Sontarans just can't resist getting involved in war.
He's just like a little boy, stirring up the red ants and the black ants. This is something to keep him amused, to stop him from getting bored.
Yes, well I think we'd better get back inside before that smoke rises. It's liable to hang around for quite some time.
Gas? Good heavens, what on Earth do you take me for? No, it was some sort of superior stink bomb with a few bangs and flashes thrown in for good measure. No, it's quite harmless, I assure you, but (sniff) phew.
No, thank you, no. Oh well, just perhaps just a little.
Well, we all played our part, Sir Edward.
Not quite, I'm afraid.
It won't work indefinitely, I fear. This time we had the element of surprise. They won't be frightened off quite so easily again.
Well, there's one sure way to prevent Irongron from capturing your castle.
You must capture his.
My Lady, are you familiar with these herbs and simples?
Excellent. I want to brew up a little draught.
No, no, not quite. Just something to calm him down a little.
(yokel) We come to beg alms of the good Captain Irongron. The fame of his charity is spread far and wide.
Heaven will reward you, my son. Come, brother.
Right, let's take a look in Linx's workshop.
That's a Sontaran spaceship, to be precise, and tremendously powerful for its size, just like its owner. Here, give me your habit.
Deep hypnosis.
Yes, well, I'm very glad we didn't. In a few hours that ship's going to be ready for takeoff.
I'm not surprised, he's suffering from near starvation.
There's no time for that.
Sarah, listen to me. Linx's spaceship is just about ready for take off. And if that happens, there's going to be the most tremendous explosion. Everybody in this castle will die.
Trying to break this hypnosis.
The brain can still receive signals, Professor. It might work.
Don't you want to get back to the twentieth century?
If I can get these people to respond, I can send them back to their own time with Linx's osmic projector.
Yes, it's over there on the table. Take a look.
It's too risky with their minds in this state. The transition might damage them permanently.
Polka time!
Hide.
Leave him, Linx!
Well, don't you want to know why I returned?
I came here to offer you my help.
Because I want something from you. If you will let me de-hypnotise people and send them home, and help me capture Irongron and his men, then I will assist you in the repairs to your spaceship. Now, the weapons that you've made for Irongron you can leave here in the castle, and when it's empty, you can take off, destroying castle and weapons at the same time. All right, Commander Linx, what do you say?
I do.
Linx, can't you see that your prisoners are physically exhausted? They've had no sleep and nothing to eat for days.
Not for much longer.
That's such an old tune. Don't you know there's no such thing as the super race?
Every species has its own weakness, Linx. For instance, you can only be stunned by a blow on the probic vent, that small hole at the back of your neck.
Well done, Rubeish.
Yes. Yes. The blast was too brief. But I wouldn't have been in a few moments. Thank you very much, Sarah.
Yes, all right, but be careful.
Right, well, if we can secure our friend here, we can get on with the job of restoring his wretched victims.
Rubeish, you're invaluable, my dear chap.
Well, that should hold him for a while, even on this planet.
Well, in his own environment he weighs several tons. Fortunately his muscles have been designed for load bearing rather than leverage.
Who speaks?
Tell him I'm busy.
Well, I wouldn't recommend him for the Royal Society. All right, Rubeish old chap, now you know how to bring these people round?
Yes, quite so. I'll leave you to get on with it.
I was going to preset this osmic projector and send these people back to their own time, but now I have to find a way of stalling Irongron.
The robot! Yes, of course. That ought to give him something to think about.
(inside the suit) I am a gift to Captain Irongron from the one who made me, my master, Commander Linx.
My master toils in his workshop to make you more fighting robots. He sent me as proof of his goodwill.
Now I must return.
That is my purpose.
I was programmed to fight for you, not against you.
You will damage my circuits.
Isn't that a bit unsporting, old man? I mean, sitting ducks and all that.
I cannot reveal my face, Irongron.
Because if I did, it might give you a seizure.
Well, I did warn you, didn't I?
Thank you, sir, for your charm and old world courtesy. May I ask the purpose of this tomfoolery? If you're going to have me shot, why don't you get on with it?
Nothing that I do will be of use to you, Irongron.
I'm in no great hurry, I assure you.
Well done, Sarah. Just like a daring young man on the flying trapeze. Come on.
Sarah, wait. Come on.
Hai!
Do you know, I think that was one of the most active days I've had in years. Well, it's not as if I was a lad anymore, once you're over two hundred.
Oh, wait a bit. Give the potion time to work and then go back.
Sarah, I must. Rubeish and all those scientists are there. Now, Linx's spaceship is just about ready for takeoff, and when that happens, there'll be a tremendous explosion and all that will be left of that castle will be a pile of stones.
Just believe me, sir. When Linx goes, it goes.
There are innocent people in that castle, my lady, and I don't like the idea of anybody going up in smoke. Not even Irongron.
Well, thank you. Thank you both. I can do with all the help I can get.
Good evening.
Good. Well, we'll wait a bit to be on the safe side, and then we'll go in.
Yes, so I see. Where's Linx?
Where's the osmic projector? It was over there on the table.
Well, I'll just have to take it out again, won't I. Hal, scout around the castle. See if Irongron and his men are sleeping. If they are, disarm them and come back here.
Get the osmic projector. Fortunately it's an independent unit.
Well, I can try.
Then we've got between five and ten minutes to get out of here before we're all blown to kingdom come.
No, the drive system is sealed. Linx must have taken the activator key. I managed to get a hold of this, though. I was lucky to get it out with the drive running. I think that should do it.
I've got to send them back one at a time. Get the first one to stand over there, will you, Rubeish?
All right, Rubeish, come over here. I may want you to take over. Now then, all you have to do is this, this and this. Get it.
Right, here goes.
Right, that ought to surprise them back at the Research Centre. Next gentleman, please.
That's Linx. Send the rest of them back. I'll try and keep him busy.
Something's gone wrong. He must have hit the take off button too soon. Come on, we've got about a minute to get out of here. Quick, run!
Well, you can tell Sir Edward that his problems are over, Hal. Irongron, his castle, his magic weapons and his sorcerer, they're all destroyed.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we must be off. Goodbye, Hal.
To tell you the truth, Hal, I'm not a magician at all.
